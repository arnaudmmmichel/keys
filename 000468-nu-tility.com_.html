will tailor a unique solar system for your home and electricity usage
You’ll speak to an expert over the phone. We’ll take the time to understand your needs, determine eligibility for a solar system and provide a price estimate over the phone. If you’re happy to proceed, we’ll book a time to visit your property.
One of our CEC accredited installers will do a thorough assessment of your property to ensure there will be no surprises for a successful installation. You will also receive a formal and final quote.

You will have unlimited access to our dedicated customer experience team. We are committed to ensuring a seamless transition into a lifetime of savings
When you have a solar system installed at your property you are utilising free energy provided by the sun. So for every kWh of energy you generate yourself, you don’t need to buy it from your retailer. Plus you may also benefit from selling your additional power back to the grid. It’s a WIN WIN!
Play your role in a sustainable future
Moving Australia to solar powered homes and businesses means that we, as a nation, rely less and less on energy produced by fossil fuels like Coal and Gas. This may be helping to reduce the affects of global warming and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
As the desire for solar power becomes more popular there is increasing evidence that solar improves the value of your property. Buyers are aware that solar will reduce the cost of electricity and therefore adding to the appeal and long term value of the property.
The solar panels installed on your roof will collect sunlight and convert to electricity, DC (Direct Current).
The inverter converts the DC power captured by your panels into AC (Alternate Current) which can be used to power your home.
The digital meter will track the energy consumption at your property and store data that can be shared with your provider.
When you choose to install a battery, you will be able to store unused power to use when the sun isn’t shining.
