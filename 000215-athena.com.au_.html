What is an Interest Only home loan?
With an Interest Only (IO) home loan, you only pay off the interest charged on your loan balance. This means your repayments are less compared to a Principal & Interest loan.
An IO loan could be a good short term option. Remember, for your IO period, you're not paying down your Principal (the loan amount you borrowed) so you'll pay more over the life of the loan.
 for IO compared to other lenders and we can match your scenarios with personalised credit assessments.

Making your mortgage repayments as low as possible may seem like a no-brainer.
Principal & Interest vs Interest Only
Itâs all about paying it off or putting it off. What is a Principal & Interest home loan?
How home loan interest rates work
Setting the record straight on home loan interest rates.
What does it mean for my repayments after the interest only period ends?â¯
Monthly repayments will revert from interest only to principal and interest. We will notify you 30 days before your interest only period ends with your estimated P&I repayment so that you will be prepared for the repayment increase. 
Important - your P&I repayment after an IO period will be higher than before your IO period, because you have to repay your loan over a shorter period of time.â¯â¯ 
Can I do another 5 years IO at the end of the IO term?â¯
In general, the maximum IO term is 5 years, but we can consider applications for a further 5 years, with a full assessment of your financial circumstances, requirements and objectives.â¯You would need to have demonstrated sound credit history on all your loans.
If we agree to an extension, we cannot extend the loan term which means that when the IO period ends your principal and interest repayments will increase significantly. 
Yes, you can. You can make 
 to your offset account or redraw facility to reduce the balance your interest is calculated on during an IO period.
Can I take money out of redraw / offset?
Yes, you can withdraw funds from redraw or 
Yes, you can switch to Principal and Interest repayment whenever you are ready. Let us know!

A heads-upâ¦ paying weekly and fortnightly instead of monthly repayments on your current term puts you a little bit ahead on your loan and will contribute towards your additional repayment limit.
Make additional repayments into your fixed loan of up to 5% of your outstanding loan balance per year.
At the beginning of your fixed rate period, your outstanding loan balance is $250,000.
5% of your loan balance is $12,500, which is how much you'll be able to pay over your minimum required repayments within the first year.
At the start of your second year, your outstanding loan balance is $231,350.
Your new maximum additional repayments will be 5% of $231,350, which is $11,567.50.
If you accidentally pay more than 5%, don't stress! We'll contact you to check. If we can't get in touch, we'll send the funds back until you confirm, as break costs can be costly.
If you make extra repayments, just remember that you'll only be able to make withdrawals at the end of the fixed rate period.
The lower your LVR (loan-to-value ratio), the lower your fixed loan rate.
Your interest rate will stay the same from the beginning to the end of your fixed rate period.
Once your fixed rate period expires, weâll review your LVR (loan-to-value ratio), and automatically roll you onto the lowest

Iâm an Athena customer on a variable rate and want to switch to a fixed rate. Whatâs the process?
Just give our home loan experts a buzz on 
Yes you can however break costs may apply depending on the situation. Read about our 
 and then call us to discuss your options and we can help you out.
Do you offer rate lock for fixed?
No we donât, for good reason. Most lenders charge a hefty fee for rate lock. We donât charge fees and we try to pass on our lowest rates to you.
When will my rate be locked in?
Your rate will be fixed from the date of settlement, or if you are switching from a variable rate, your fixed rate will be as of the date we switch you over.
A heads-up! Before you begin your fixed rate period, rates may change at any time. The applicable fixed rate will be the advertised fixed rates on the day of settlement for a new fixed rate loan or the day of processing your switch to a fixed rate home loan.
What happens at the end of my fixed rate term?
When youâre close to the end of your fixed rate term, weâll let you know prior that weâll automatically roll you onto our low 
 based on your LVR (loan-to-value ratio) tier at the time your fixed term expires.
If you have a 100% fixed loan, youâll roll off onto our 
. And if you have a fixed rate loan as part of a split facility, youâll roll onto our 
When will a break cost be charged?
A break fee may be charged when there's a change to your fixed rate loan such as:
Additional repayments â When your additional repayments go over the 5% of loan balance per year
Repayment in full â If you want to end the fixed rate period entirely. It may happen if you want to repay the loan in full due to a property sale, refinance to another lender or any other reason
Ending your fixed rate period early â If you want to end the fixed rate period before the agreed term and wish to switch to a variable rate loan
Variations â Examples include if you want a loan top up, if you change your repayment type from 
 to Principal & Interest or vice versa, or want a limit decrease
If youâd like to know break costs specific to your scenario, just call us on [13 35 35](tel:13 35 35).
Can I renew my loan at the end of my fixed rate period?
Absolutely. If you want to make changes after your fixed rate period ends, contact us and weâll sort you out.
Why canât I access my redraw during the fixed rate period?
Redraw is the additional funds youâve paid over the minimum repayment. They are counted towards your allowable annual repayment amount during a fixed rate period without incurring a break cost.
Youâll need to be sure that you wonât need those funds during the rest of your fixed rate period as you wonât be able to withdraw them again. You can access your redraw once you revert to a variable rate at the end of your fixed rate period.
Can I top up my loan in a fixed rate period?
Yes but itâll cause a break cost assessment as it may trigger significant break costs.
Call us on [13 35 35](tel:13 35 35) if you want to know your options.
Can I increase my fixed rate period?
Once your fixed term starts you wonât be able to increase it without triggering a break cost assessment.
What is the advantage of a fixed rate mortgage?
When choosing a home loan, if you have a budget and prefer to know exactly what you'll pay in your home loan repayments each month for a few years, then a fixed rate home loan or mortgage could be suitable for you

. Applies to Athena's Straight Up and Power Up Home Loan products and excludes all others. A like-for-like loan means the product name (e.g., Straight Up) and LVR tier (e.g., â¤50%, 50-60%, 60-70%, or 70-80%) advertised to new customers must be the same product name and the same LVR tier that you have as an existing customer. The way we construct and name products may include a combination of the loanâs purpose (e.g., Owner, Investor), repayment type (e.g., P&I, IO), interest type (e.g., variable), borrower type, different features, or specific qualification criteria. However, none of these criteria will be designed to favour new customers over existing customers. If we ever offer new customers a lower rate on a like-for-like loan, anyone whoâs on it will get the Automatic Rate Match.

. It is a base rate in our systems that is associated with each different loan product and is the same for every customer on that product type. The interest rate you are charged is calculated by your LVR discount from your reference rate. If your LVR is exactly 60%, you would qualify for the â¤60% LVR tier. If your LVR is exactly 70%, you would qualify for the 60-70% LVR tier. LVR is calculated using Loan Amount, which does not include redraw or offset funds and based off your property value from the approved property valuation at the time you originally applied for the loan.
 is a percentage discount applied to your product's reference rate, in order to determine your final interest rate. Applies to Athena's Straight Up and Power Up Home Loan products and excludes all others. LVR discounts reward you for reducing your loan amount, and are not intended to vary as the property market changes over the life of the loan. We will not generally accept requests to revalue the mortgaged property over the life of the loan for the purpose of determining the security value unless the value of the mortgaged property has materially changed, such as a major renovation of the mortgaged property. Any revaluations will be at our full discretion and we will pass on the costs of any valuation that you request.
 calculated on a $150,000 secured loan over a 25 year term. WARNING: Comparison rate is true only for the examples given and may not include all fees and charges. Different terms, fees or other loan amounts might result in a different comparison rate. Comparison rates for Fixed rate loans are based on a Straight Up revert rate. Comparison rates for variable interest only loans are based on an initial 5-year interest only period. Comparison rates for fixed Interest Only loans are based on an initial interest only period equal in length to the fixed period. During an Interest Only period, your Interest Only payments will not reduce your loan balance. This may mean you pay more interest over the life of the loan.
