Testimonial from our staff member Lisa
GOGO Events and the GOGO Foundation changed my life! 
After completing the Inclusive Work Program with the GOGO Foundation I was still struggling to find employment because I was worried no one would want to hire me with my criminal record. 
That’s where GOGO Events (specifically Sarah Gun) stepped in. 
 in my ability to grab any opportunity with both hands and gave me the opportunity to work directly for her at her events company. 
I worked a couple of hospitality shifts, serving food at an event and doing a set up at the Entertainment Centre (all whilst on home detention) but the main turning point was when I worked on planning an event for one of GOGO’s corporate clients. 
I spent quite a lot of hours not only meeting with the client to discuss what their vision was for their Christmas party but also getting quotes from different suppliers, setting up a spreadsheet to track all details of the event and liaising with Sarah on all aspects for approval. 
in knowing I still had the nouse to do this type of work. Sarah was amazing with feedback and we worked really well together. 
. I met the love of my life, I have my 11 yo son Oscar with me week on/week off, I have a beautiful step daughter, have just moved into a brand new townhouse in a great area and 5 months ago i secured my dream full time job with a company who is very flexible and understanding.
If it wasn’t for GOGO Events, I would never have been confident enough to apply for my dream job but hey, here I am living my best life. Thank you GOGO.
GOGO Events is forging the way in our South Australian community as a business dedicated to giving back to the people and the planet.
We have been fortunate enough to work with GOGO on two events focusing on bringing our foster and kinship carer community together on state and national levels.
Each event GOGO focussed on sourcing local suppliers, goods and services, with 
 attendees with each other through good food, meaningful conversation and thoughtful planning.
l by GOGO, they had the heart and soul needed to ensure a triumphant outcome for our organisation and our carer community.
When I think of GOGO events, I am reminded of an African Proverb that summarises their spirit perfectly. “If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together”.
GOGO is committed to the long haul,
 achieving sustainable, meaningful outcomes for the planet, whilst encouraging, teaching and investing in our global citizens to be part of the journey.

We brought Dulcie's Bus - the opp-shop Bus of Opportunities where all funds made go to Hutt Street Centre and Centacare. We dressed our guest who had travelled from far and wide for The Great Gatsby dinner at the Adelaide Town Hall. What fun it was and all for such great causes.
We screen printed 650 t-shirts by hand in at the Adelaide College of the Arts and taught 10 disadvantaged women this fine art in the process. The t-shirts were used as charicovers at the Food Awards dinner and guests took them home as a momento.
