Partner With Us for Wholesale Coffee
                We are proud to partner with likeminded businesses that want to serve memorable, delicious, sustainable and ethically sourced coffees.
At Market Lane, we have been sourcing, roasting and sharing quality, traceable and sustainable coffee since 2009. In addition to our coffee shops, we are a wholesale coffee supplier, providing freshly roasted coffee beans to some of the finest hospitality venues and businesses in Melbourne, across Australia, and around the globe.
The focus of our wholesale program is to provide exceptional coffee, service and support to partners who share our values. Our goal is to help all of our wholesale partners – big and small – present a considered, differentiated and elevated coffee experience, and to add value and insight through training, collaboration and tailored advice.
Our aim is to supply exceptional coffee beans, expertise, training and support to our wholesale partners so they can offer an unparalleled coffee experience.
Our dedicated wholesale team is here to support you and help you succeed. As our wholesale partner you will receive:
High quality, traceable and sustainable coffee
Our approach to quality is uncompromising. It starts with the dedicated, quality-focused coffee producers with who we have 
 based on shared values and trust. We visit these producers regularly, working closely with them to select distinctive and delicious coffees. We then roast these coffees in small batches at our Melbourne roastery, carefully monitoring and assessing each one to ensure that our coffee is always tasting its best. 
When sharing coffees, our goal is simple: to make great coffee accessible and exciting, simple to understand and appreciate, and easy to brew and enjoy. Storytelling is central to this mission – we strive to share as much information as possible about our delicious beans and the incredible people behind them, to get everyone as excited about these coffees as we are.
At Market Lane, one of our core values is Using Business for Good. One way we enact this is to continuously look for ways to 
, and we supply bulk wholesale coffee to our partners in tins to reduce single-use packaging. Our roastery is powered by solar panels, and we are 
As your wholesale coffee supplier and partner, we are here to help you succeed! A key part of this success is ensuring that your team members are well-trained and engaged, and have the knowledge and tools they need to confidently serve and talk about our coffees. Our wholesale program covers everything – from hands-on training focused on preparing drinks and managing consistency and quality as your business scales up, through to educational sessions that help develop your team’s tasting skills and understanding of how things like origin, processing and variety impact cup flavour and quality. We also have a dedicated wholesale newsletter and a 
 called ‘Coffee Up!’ produced by the wholesale team for our wholesale customers.
Since opening Market Lane in 2009, we’ve learnt a lot about running coffee shops. Over the years, we have also gained a wealth of experience by partnering with some of the finest restaurants, cafes, bars and retailers in Australia and overseas. Beyond our training program, we’re also able to provide extensive consulting and advice on design, equipment and workflow. We are here to help you set up or elevate your coffee program, and to tailor it to meet your unique business needs.
We love hosting events and collaborating with our wholesale partners to engage with their team and customers in unique and meaningful ways. Recent events we’ve co-hosted include a session on how to brew better coffee at home, an educational evening about a single coffee-producing origin, and an olive oil tasting and information session. We always value these opportunities to connect with, and contribute to, a community of like-minded businesses, around Australia and the world.
                Do you have a minimum order quantity?
We don’t, you can order as much or as little coffee as you need. We’re proud to be the wholesale coffee supplier for some of Melbourne’s favourite restaurants and creative agencies, some of who order only a couple of bags of coffee a week. 
                Do you supply coffee shops, cafes, offices, retailers or restaurants outside of Melbourne?
Yes, all of the above! We have longstanding wholesale coffee partnerships with incredible businesses around Australia and internationally. We’re always keen to chat with likeminded people who want to share delicious, ethically sourced coffee with their local community. 
                How does your ordering and roasting schedule work?
All our coffee is roasted fresh to order. Our wholesale coffee orders are roasted on Monday and Thursday mornings. We ask that all orders be placed before 5pm the day before to guarantee they’ll be included in the following day’s roast schedule.
We offer 1kg and 250g bags. For local customers (within 15km of our Brunswick East roastery), we can also deliver coffee in 5kg returnable tin pails.
Our coffee bags are 60% biodegradable and compostable. If you’re in Melbourne, you have the option of returning your coffee bags to us; we will send them on to Terracycle for recycling. 
Yes, you can pick your coffee beans up from our 
 in  Brunswick East. We can also arrange to have your order available for pick-up at any of our 
We do! We have a curriculum of knowledge and skill-based workshops to ensure that you and your team members feel confident brewing, serving, retailing and talking about Market Lane’s coffees. 
We have a great relationship with La Marzocco. We use their espresso machines in all our shops, and we can confidently recommend them to our wholesale customers. We also use and recommend Mazzer and Mahlkönig grinders. 
                Do you provide technical support for coffee equipment?
We’ve partnered with Brewtech in the Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane areas to provide scheduled servicing and preventative maintenance, and to assist with time sensitive emergency call-outs.
                How do you source your coffee?
Since 2009, we’ve focused on building direct and long-term relationships with dedicated coffee producers who share our values and obsession with quality. We’re committed to sourcing coffee ethically and responsibly. Read more about our sourcing approach and principles. 
                What are you doing to reduce your environmental impact as a coffee supplier?

                What’s the difference between espresso and filter roasts?
Coffee roasted for espresso is roasted darker than a filter roast. This roast will taste a little bit stronger and have less acidity than our lighter filter roast. We recommend beans roasted for espresso if you’re making coffee with an espresso machine or stove top, but you can also use this roast if you tend to prefer a stronger, less acidic coffee made with other brew methods (including filter brewing).
Filter roast is what we normally would recommend for filter brewing methods (for example, pour over, Aeropress, Moccamaster and plunger). Our filter coffee beans are roasted to be suitable for slower and gentler brew methods and have great clarity and a balanced acidity, sweetness and aftertaste. We find that filter roasts tend to taste a little weak and unbalanced when used with espresso-style brew methods.
                What's the best way to store coffee beans? How long do they keep?
Coffee beans are best stored at room temperature in a dry, dark and airtight container. Keeping the beans in the bag they came in, and weighing out the beans you need as you go is also great (just make sure you roll the bag tight after each use).
We recommend that you use freshly roasted coffee beans within 4–6 weeks after the roast date. If you can, buy in smaller quantities so your beans are always fresh and this way you can also try different coffees depending on what’s in season. 
                Do you have an espresso recipe I can follow?
We use a standard recipe for all the coffees across all our shops. Check out our 
 and if you need any more help or tips, talk to our friendly baristas next time you visit our shops or send us a email at 
Our espresso roasts are our darkest roasts. We look for a balance of acidity, sweetness and aftertaste. We roast our beans quite lightly to highlight the characteristics of each individual coffee, and to avoid masking them with any roast flavours. If you find it a little higher in acidity than what you are used to, these 
might help, or send us an email at 
 with any questions you might have.
                What do the tasting notes mean?
The tasting notes refer to the flavour profile of the coffee, as each coffee tastes a little bit different (sometimes very different) depending on the location of the farm, which variety of coffee that’s grown there, and how the coffee was processed to get the seed/beans out of the fruit. The coffee will taste and smell like coffee, but within that taste we look for types of sweetness, acidity, aftertaste, mouthfeel and aromas that are distinctive about that particular coffee, and we use those tasting notes to describe those characteristics.
                I can’t find the coffee I bought last time.
All our coffees are seasonal and we roast in small batches until we run out. Once we’ve roasted all of that coffee, we replace it with a new, fresh coffee. If you’re looking for something similar to what you bought, send us an email at 
. We’d be happy to recommend something from our current offering of coffee beans.
Decaf is inherently more processed than regular coffee. We’ve found that the decaffeination process greatly affects the taste of the coffee, and causes the unroasted coffee to age much faster, leading to woody and dry flavours. Ultimately, we’re not happy to sell coffee that tastes like this, even though we know some people love it!  
                What’s the right grind size for cold drip?
In our shops we make an iced pour over brewing with hot water and letting the coffee drip over ice. For this method we recommend a pour over grind. If you are steeping coffee in cold water over a longer period, we would recommend the plunger grind size, though please note there is no one correct grind size. You can use a finer grind to make cold brew, and this works well if you’re dripping cold water through the bed of coffee. If you prefer a different grind size, please ask.
