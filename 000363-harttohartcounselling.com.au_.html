The NDIS can be challenging to navigate, but weâre here to support you and your family at every step.
Hart to Hart have been a wonderful resource for me.  They are both extremely knowledgeable about what services could be offered to my son through his NDIS plan and funds.
They are always on time for appointments, thoughtful on how they approach their clients and have a real willingness to help parents and their kids achieve their goals.
They don't just 'dump' you off to a service and leave you to fend for yourself like I have experienced in the past.  They step you through each process, check in with you on a regular basis and provide an individual/personalised service.  Something I am not used to!
They have a wonderful support team who go above and beyond what you would normally expect from a provider. Without their assistance, guidance, encouragement and support I would have been an absolute basket case! They truly do things from the heart!					
They truly do things from the heart!
The service is very professional, very punctual, they always have information at their hand, they're very knowledgeable and they also have lots of contacts that help set up my health and welfare. They are very approachable and a great service.					
They are very useful. They do things straight away. I will definately keep using them. They are great!					
Theyâre my NDIS coordinators, they find services and give various options to choose from. They offer me things like physio, OT, podiatry, and taking me to appointments. Theyâre very approachable, polite and available anytime. I recently had an appointment with one of the partnerships, and are extremely caring and will provide whatever I need. Theyâre always a phone call away. The biggest thing is they save me the hassle of running around and trying to access sections of the community Iâm unable to with my NDIS. And also, they also accompany to my review appointments, and are just very friendly and treat me with respect. Theyâre just amazing, Iâm so glad to be able to give them good feedback.					
They were recommended by my best friend. I had a bad experience with another organisation. Within 2 weeks of signing up with them, things were put in place. On the first visit to me, a couple of days later I had my house cleaner come. She also organised my gardening and to get some rubbish removed from my backyard. They offered to come and support me the first time I had a dietician appointment. Sheâs put in requests to my plan manager for other things I need. All of these things were organised on the first appointment. Iâd give her 12 out of 10 if I could. They are also lovely to talk to and I would recommend them to anyone whoâs having difficulty with their provider. Sheâs happy to travel to me and she rings and calls me and is in constant contact with me and makes sure Iâm in the loop.					
I used this service for my great nephew. They did so much for my him, they gave him 
, helped him with his sporting activities and psychiatrist. They organised a camp for him too. They also helped out with transport and a support person. Thereâs nothing weâve asked for they havenât been able to do. I canât think of anything they can improve on. Theyâve been prompt and gotten straight back to me when Iâve called, and occasionally check up on how things are going which I really appreciate. They give 120%.					
I hired the service to support me in all my requirements for life, filling out forms, or anything I need with my disability. They do everything they can to help me to life a normal life. They help me to get a job, calling agencies, calling people to my house to help to support me. She does not over-pressure me because she knows about my disabilities. I would like to be with this organisation for the rest of my life if I could. They are like a family to me. My worker is the best worker for me. I would love to do more but am limited by funding. 
A really great knowledge of services that are available and that suite their clients. Always able to take calls and emails, always respond in a timely manner. They are such a great help.

The NDIS can be challenging to navigate, but weâre here to support you and your family at every step.
Hart to Hart have been a wonderful resource for me.  They are both extremely knowledgeable about what services could be offered to my son through his NDIS plan and funds.
They are always on time for appointments, thoughtful on how they approach their clients and have a real willingness to help parents and their kids achieve their goals.
They don't just 'dump' you off to a service and leave you to fend for yourself like I have experienced in the past.  They step you through each process, check in with you on a regular basis and provide an individual/personalised service.  Something I am not used to!
They have a wonderful support team who go above and beyond what you would normally expect from a provider. Without their assistance, guidance, encouragement and support I would have been an absolute basket case! They truly do things from the heart!					
They truly do things from the heart!
The service is very professional, very punctual, they always have information at their hand, they're very knowledgeable and they also have lots of contacts that help set up my health and welfare. They are very approachable and a great service.					
They are very useful. They do things straight away. I will definately keep using them. They are great!					
Theyâre my NDIS coordinators, they find services and give various options to choose from. They offer me things like physio, OT, podiatry, and taking me to appointments. Theyâre very approachable, polite and available anytime. I recently had an appointment with one of the partnerships, and are extremely caring and will provide whatever I need. Theyâre always a phone call away. The biggest thing is they save me the hassle of running around and trying to access sections of the community Iâm unable to with my NDIS. And also, they also accompany to my review appointments, and are just very friendly and treat me with respect. Theyâre just amazing, Iâm so glad to be able to give them good feedback.					
They were recommended by my best friend. I had a bad experience with another organisation. Within 2 weeks of signing up with them, things were put in place. On the first visit to me, a couple of days later I had my house cleaner come. She also organised my gardening and to get some rubbish removed from my backyard. They offered to come and support me the first time I had a dietician appointment. Sheâs put in requests to my plan manager for other things I need. All of these things were organised on the first appointment. Iâd give her 12 out of 10 if I could. They are also lovely to talk to and I would recommend them to anyone whoâs having difficulty with their provider. Sheâs happy to travel to me and she rings and calls me and is in constant contact with me and makes sure Iâm in the loop.					
I used this service for my great nephew. They did so much for my him, they gave him 
, helped him with his sporting activities and psychiatrist. They organised a camp for him too. They also helped out with transport and a support person. Thereâs nothing weâve asked for they havenât been able to do. I canât think of anything they can improve on. Theyâve been prompt and gotten straight back to me when Iâve called, and occasionally check up on how things are going which I really appreciate. They give 120%.					
I hired the service to support me in all my requirements for life, filling out forms, or anything I need with my disability. They do everything they can to help me to life a normal life. They help me to get a job, calling agencies, calling people to my house to help to support me. She does not over-pressure me because she knows about my disabilities. I would like to be with this organisation for the rest of my life if I could. They are like a family to me. My worker is the best worker for me. I would love to do more but am limited by funding. 
A really great knowledge of services that are available and that suite their clients. Always able to take calls and emails, always respond in a timely manner. They are such a great help.

The NDIS can be challenging to navigate, but weâre here to support you and your family at every step.
Hart to Hart have been a wonderful resource for me.  They are both extremely knowledgeable about what services could be offered to my son through his NDIS plan and funds.
They are always on time for appointments, thoughtful on how they approach their clients and have a real willingness to help parents and their kids achieve their goals.
They don't just 'dump' you off to a service and leave you to fend for yourself like I have experienced in the past.  They step you through each process, check in with you on a regular basis and provide an individual/personalised service.  Something I am not used to!
They have a wonderful support team who go above and beyond what you would normally expect from a provider. Without their assistance, guidance, encouragement and support I would have been an absolute basket case! They truly do things from the heart!					
They truly do things from the heart!
The service is very professional, very punctual, they always have information at their hand, they're very knowledgeable and they also have lots of contacts that help set up my health and welfare. They are very approachable and a great service.					
They are very useful. They do things straight away. I will definately keep using them. They are great!					
Theyâre my NDIS coordinators, they find services and give various options to choose from. They offer me things like physio, OT, podiatry, and taking me to appointments. Theyâre very approachable, polite and available anytime. I recently had an appointment with one of the partnerships, and are extremely caring and will provide whatever I need. Theyâre always a phone call away. The biggest thing is they save me the hassle of running around and trying to access sections of the community Iâm unable to with my NDIS. And also, they also accompany to my review appointments, and are just very friendly and treat me with respect. Theyâre just amazing, Iâm so glad to be able to give them good feedback.					
They were recommended by my best friend. I had a bad experience with another organisation. Within 2 weeks of signing up with them, things were put in place. On the first visit to me, a couple of days later I had my house cleaner come. She also organised my gardening and to get some rubbish removed from my backyard. They offered to come and support me the first time I had a dietician appointment. Sheâs put in requests to my plan manager for other things I need. All of these things were organised on the first appointment. Iâd give her 12 out of 10 if I could. They are also lovely to talk to and I would recommend them to anyone whoâs having difficulty with their provider. Sheâs happy to travel to me and she rings and calls me and is in constant contact with me and makes sure Iâm in the loop.					
I used this service for my great nephew. They did so much for my him, they gave him 
, helped him with his sporting activities and psychiatrist. They organised a camp for him too. They also helped out with transport and a support person. Thereâs nothing weâve asked for they havenât been able to do. I canât think of anything they can improve on. Theyâve been prompt and gotten straight back to me when Iâve called, and occasionally check up on how things are going which I really appreciate. They give 120%.					
I hired the service to support me in all my requirements for life, filling out forms, or anything I need with my disability. They do everything they can to help me to life a normal life. They help me to get a job, calling agencies, calling people to my house to help to support me. She does not over-pressure me because she knows about my disabilities. I would like to be with this organisation for the rest of my life if I could. They are like a family to me. My worker is the best worker for me. I would love to do more but am limited by funding. 
A really great knowledge of services that are available and that suite their clients. Always able to take calls and emails, always respond in a timely manner. They are such a great help.
