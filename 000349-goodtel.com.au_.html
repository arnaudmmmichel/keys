How do I know you actually give 50% to charity?
Goodtel is independently audited by a third party to ensure we've donated 50% of profits to our charity partners at the end of each year. Those charities also send us a letter of confirmation detailing the total amount Goodtel has donated to them, which we will make publicly available.
You can read more about our impact, and read letters from our charity partners 
How can I help Goodtel to provide additional support to its charity partners?
            By telling everyone you know about Goodtel. If every one of our customers just told one of their friends about us this would have a significant impact on the good work our charity partners do.
Can I suggest a charity to become a charity partner of Goodtel's?
            Yes you can. As Goodtel is a new company we have limited the number of charity partners we work with to ensure we can make a material difference to the work they do. Over time as Goodtel grows we may look to add to new charity partners. 
Yes we are 100% Australian owned.
Why does Goodtel contribute 50% of its profits to charities?
Goodtel is about helping the planet and those who need it most. We know most businesses are in to maximising their profit for shareholders and there is no judgement from us. We just prefer to be part of a new wave businesses that believe doing good is just as important as making a profit. Goodtel is certainly not the only company that thinks this but is very proud to be a part of this way of thinking.

Why doesnt Goodtel just make it's plans even cheaper instead of contributing a significant part of its profits to charities?
            There are many ways to help others and so many people that need help. Goodtel believes there are lots of great charities out there doing amazing work and we have decided to help them rather than simply set up to be the cheapest telco in the market. In our experience someone will always come along and want to be the cheapest so it’s not something that is very sustainable. Goodtel wants to be different and do something that has the potential to actually make a difference where it is needed most. 
Why should I switch to Goodtel for nbnᵀᴹ?
Good question. It's true - you could probably find a cheaper telco providing a similar quality of NBN services.
But that's not what sets us apart. At Goodtel, doing good for the planet is our top priority. And that extends from our helpful support team who'll be there for you night and day, through to the core of why we exist as a company - to support our various charity partners as they help make the planet a better place.
And, of course, our NBN service uses trusted networks to provide you with reliable, blazing-fast broadband. So when you choose Goodtel, you're combining your need for fast, reliable internet with your desire to do good in the world. We're confident it's a choice you'll feel good about.
How long does it take to switch to the nbnᵀᴹ?
The timeframe will vary dependent on the equipment you have available at your place, and if there has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ connection.
There has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ connection at my home, and I have my own nbnᵀᴹ compatible modem
Well, that's perfect! In this case, we should be able to have you up and running in 1-3 business days. Please note, if you BYO modem, you will need to configure it for your new connection. We will send you a general guide on how to do this, but it does vary by modem.
There has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ connection at my home, but I will be purchasing a compatible modem from Goodtel
Our modems are pre-configured for your nbnᵀᴹ connection, so when it comes, you can plug and play! 
There has never been an nbnᵀᴹ connection at my home
If your address has not been connected to nbnᵀᴹ before, the standard time frame can be anywhere between 1-3 weeks and is dependent on your nbnᵀᴹ access technology type and technician availability. Your nbnᵀᴹ access technology will determine the exact method of installation for your technician. To check if your address is nbnᵀᴹ ready, head 
Can I use my existing modem, or do I need a new one?
Can I use my existing modem, or do I need a new one?
, in most cases yes you can. We can't guarantee every modem will work on our network but we will do our best to get you connected. If you have an old modem that isnt nbnᵀᴹ ready you can send it to us at 20/40 Meagher St, Chippendale NSW 2008 and we will arrange to have it recycled. Alternatively, your local Officeworks should be able to recycle it for you too.
Please note, if you BYO modem, you will need to configure it for your new connection. We will send you a general guide on how to do this, but it does vary by modem.
Do I need to cancel my  nbnᵀᴹ  service with my current provider to move to Goodtel?
For HFC, FTTN, FTTB or FTTC connections, your original service will stop working automatically when your Goodtel service becomes active. You may want to check with your previous provider that they have stopped billing you - but this should occur automatically. 
For FTTP and Fixed Wireless connections you will need to advise your previous provider that you wish to cancel their service once you have had confirmation from Goodtel that your service is active with us. Do not cancel your service before having this confirmation from Goodtel.
Find out what type of connection you have at your home by heading 
 clicking 'pick an nbnᵀᴹ plan' and using our address checker.
I need help with my first nbnᵀᴹ bill
The nbnᵀᴹ billing period is from the first to the last day of the month. On your first bill, you will have a prorated charge from your activation date to the end of that month, and also your first full month in advance. The upfront payment that you made at sign up will be deducted from this total amount.
For example, if I order the Superfast nbnᵀᴹ plan at $98/mth on the 11th of March, then I will pay $98 at the time of ordering. Say my nbnᵀᴹ is then activated by Goodtel on the 15th of March. I will receive my first nbnᵀᴹ bill in the first week of April, which will be for the period of 15th of March to 31st March and also one month in advance from 1st of April to the 30th of April. The $98 payment I made on sign up will be deducted from the total bill amount. All subsequent bills will be sent in the first week of the month for the period of that month.
What's the difference between the modems Goodtel sell?
. It includes Wifi and is perfectly suitable for most homes.
Netcomm NF20MESH Wifi Router + Signal Booster 
is the upgraded modem and provides a greater range of Wifi meaning it will reach further locations in your home than the standard nbnᵀᴹ modem.
If your house is particularly large or you simply want, best possible performance from your home network the Netcomm NF20MESH Wifi Router + Signal Booster is for you.
At check out, we'll ask you if you'd like to purchase one of the above modems, or BYO modem.
Can I use my existing modem, or do I need a new one?

Save $5/mth on your mobile plan when you bundle it with an nbnᵀᴹ plan (up to 2 mobile services). You don't need to do anything to get this discount, we'll apply it for you!
Can I change my nbnᵀᴹ plan?
 to change your nbnᵀᴹ plan. There is no cost to change plans other than the difference in the plan cost. Available plans are listed 
I'm moving house, can you arrange nbnᵀᴹ at my new address?
Yes we can. Depending on the type of technology available at the new property and whether there has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ service there it can take up to 4 weeks from the date of order. Be sure to get in touch as soon as you know your new address and move in date.
, leave the nbnᵀᴹ box at your current home. The equipment is registered to the specific address, and won't work at any other address. More info on that 
Does Goodtel provide all the different options for accessing the nbnᵀᴹ?
            Goodtel provides HFC, FTTN, FTTB, FTTC, FTTP and Fixed Wireless nbnᵀᴹ services as well as nbnᵀᴹ TC2 for businesses.
Do I have to switch to the nbnᵀᴹ?
            In the large majority of cases yes you do. The nbnᵀᴹ is replacing traditional landline and internet networks across Australia. If you don't switch to the nbnᵀᴹ before the disconnection date you run the risk of being without internet and phone service.
When can I connect to the nbnᵀᴹ?
            The nbnᵀᴹ will be available to everyone over time with the service being rolled out across Australia in stages.
You can find out when the nbnᵀᴹ is available to order at your property by visiting www.goodtel.com.au/good-nbn and entering your address in the middle of the screen. We'll let you know if it's ready to order what nbnᵀᴹ technology you will receive.
When you're ready to order simply order here on our website or call us on 1800 11 GOOD.
Will my home phone work when I switch to the nbnᵀᴹ?
Yep! We'll ask you during check out if you need landline calls. If you do, we will transfer your existing phone number onto an nbnᵀᴹ Phone service. You can then connect your phone to the router we supply you or use an IP based handset.
Are there any upfront costs for your nbnᵀᴹ or mobile plans?
You'll pay for your first month of service when you sign up. This amount will be taken off of your first bill.
I need help with my first nbnᵀᴹ bill
Which nbnᵀᴹ plan is best for me?
For the majority of our customers, the Family plan is the best balance between price and performance with up to 42mpbs during the evening. It'll cover the needs of 3-4 regular users streaming, browsing, studying, and using social media.
However, if you're an individual or couple, the Casual plan is just fine. Speeds up to 21mbps should cover your needs unless you're downloading huge files.
For larger (4+) families or users who need to use the internet intensively, our Superfast plan is the best option with blazing-fast speeds of up to 83mpbs - ideal for nearly any online activity. 
The above is intended to be a guide only. You can change your plan anytime with no cost for doing so by 
. All Goodtel nbnᵀᴹ plans have unlimited data with no set up fees or contracts.
What should I do with my old modem if it's not compatible with the nbnᵀᴹ?
You can send it to us at 20/40 Meagher St, Chippendale NSW 2008 and we will arrange to have it recycled. Alternatively, your local Officeworks should be able to recycle it for you too.
How much data do your nbnᵀᴹ plans have?
All of our nbnᵀᴹ plans come with unlimited data and no lock in contracts. Which is pretty good, isn't it?
Do I get a static IP address with my nbnᵀᴹ?
All Goodtel nbnᵀᴹ plans include a sticky IP address. This means that the public IP address of your connection does not change every time you connect to our network This is useful if you wish to access computer or other connected equipment from outside your property. This may include CCTV cameras, or a home media centre or NAS drive. Please note though that in very rare occassions and as deemed necessary by network engineering team - there may be rare instances where the IP address could change.
The sticky IP address is only available after your service becomes active. You can quickly check what this is by searching 'What is my IP address' in a search engine like Google.
If I decide to cancel, is there a fee?
None of our mobile or nbnᵀᴹ plans have lock in contracts, and there are no cancellations fees. You can cancel your plan at any time before the end of your current billing period. For nbnᵀᴹ where you pay for a month in advance, you will not receive a refund or credit for any unused days of the current billing period of your plan that fall after your cancellation date.
How long will my modem take to arrive?
The timing of when the modem is dispatched depends on your NBN Service Class and if you indicated a preferred start date for your service during sign up.
The NBN Service Class is usually included on the email correspondence that we send when your service has been ordered.
3, 6, 13, 24 and 34
Modems are usually dispatched upon ordering of the NBN Service. This way, the modem can be sent pre-configured and would allow customers to just plug it in upon receipt.
13, 24 and 34 (Moving from another provider)
We send the modem first (unconfigured) and transfer the service only until we have confirmed that you have received the modem. The reason for this is to minimize downtime as in able for us to send the modem configured, we need the Username. The username can only be obtained when the service is ordered. When we process the order, it would disconnect your service with the other provider and you would not have any connection until you receive the modem which may take 1 to 2 business days.
1,2, 5, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 31 & 32
We usually send out the modem immediately after ordering the service. If you have provided a preferred start date, we target the ordering close to your nominated date to avoid it being activated way to early that you prefer but still giving ample time for delivery time as appointments for NBN usually happen between 1 to 3 weeks anyway.
The delivery time frame will vary depending on your location and courier. Guidelines are below.
Modem ordered today before 11:00 AM Sydney time
Modem ordered past 11:00 AM Sydney time
Modem will be ordered the next day + 1 to 2 Business days
Modem ordered today before 11:00 AM Sydney time
Modem ordered past 11:00 AM Sydney time
Modem will be ordered the next day + 1 to 2 Business days
8am to 6pm, Monday to Friday.
If you’re in WA, 8am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday.
No we do not lock our modems. If you were ever to leave you could use these with most other providers.
How do I set up my password on the modem I purchased through Goodtel?
To set up your password for your Netcomm NF18MESHG Wifi router, please see the

Can I keep my mobile number?
Yep! As long as it's an active Aussie service which you can receive a verification text message to - you're good!
During sign up, we'll ask you if you want to bring your current mobile number over, or get a new one. The switch won't happen until you receive your SIM card in the mail and then initiate the SIM activation on the Goodtel website, so you're in control. 
There shouldn't be any service down time during the switch, and you'll know when it's time to pop your Goodtel SIM in when your old SIM goes into SOS. 
Switching can take up to 4 hours, but usually takes only a few minutes. You can initiate your SIM activation at any time, but generally switches are only processed between 8am-6pm on weekdays, and 10am-6pm on Saturdays, Sydney time.
What do I need to provide Goodtel to bring my number over?
Get double data for 6 months on our 32GB and above mobile plans. Valid until 31st July, 2023. T+C

nbn™ enterprise ethernet is grade fibre service that delivers bandwidth with the highest speeds, performance and reliability available across the nbn ethernet access network. nbn™ enterprise ethernet comes with High and Low Class of Service (CoS).
What is the difference between High and Low Class of Service (CoS)?
A Low CoS is when the bandwidth is not guaranteed. Your bandwidth will be dependent on how else your network is being used.
A High CoS means you will have 100Mpbs at the Network Termination Device (NTD) available at all times, no matter how else the network is being used.
High CoS costs more as you get the dedicated speed guarantee and is ideal for businesses that use data reliant applications, including voice, video conferencing and CRM database queries.

This will be dependent on the technology already available at the site. Our team will be able to advise on timelines when you share the address details of the site you wish to connect.

I need help with my first nbnᵀᴹ bill
The nbnᵀᴹ billing period is from the first to the last day of the month. On your first bill, you will have a prorated charge from your activation date to the end of that month, and also your first full month in advance. The upfront payment that you made at sign up will be deducted from this total amount.
For example, if I order the Superfast nbnᵀᴹ plan at $98/mth on the 11th of March, then I will pay $98 at the time of ordering. Say my nbnᵀᴹ is then activated by Goodtel on the 15th of March. I will receive my first nbnᵀᴹ bill in the first week of April, which will be for the period of 15th of March to 31st March and also one month in advance from 1st of April to the 30th of April. The $98 payment I made on sign up will be deducted from the total bill amount. All subsequent bills will be sent in the first week of the month for the period of that month.
Are there any upfront costs for your nbnᵀᴹ or mobile plans?
You'll pay for your first month of service when you sign up. This amount will be taken off of your first bill.
I need help with my first nbnᵀᴹ bill
What are your late payment fees?
If you have not paid your invoice within 5 days after the monthly due date there will be a $15.00 ex GST debit added to your account. If two invoices go unpaid, we will suspend your services until payment is made. The due date is the 15th of every month.
We understand that sometimes you may not be able to pay your Goodtel bill on time. However, if you know this in advance, it is always best to request a payment extension or payment plan to let us know. You can do so by sending an email to 
 or calling us on 1800 11 GOOD (4663).
Getting a payment extension or a payment plan will help you avoid potential late payment fees and suspensions to your service(s).
If I decide to cancel, is there a fee?
None of our mobile or nbnᵀᴹ plans have lock in contracts, and there are no cancellations fees. You can cancel your plan at any time before the end of your current billing period. For nbnᵀᴹ where you pay for a month in advance, you will not receive a refund or credit for any unused days of the current billing period of your plan that fall after your cancellation date.
Why is my balance in the negative?
If the balance shows a negative amount, you do not need to make another payment. Here are some reasons why your balance may show a negative amount:
The negative balance is usually your pre-payment amount when you first signed up. This amount sits on your account as a credit while waiting for your service to be connected. This amount would be covered when your first bill is generated.
 If you have been a long-time customer and you see negative balance on your account, it is possible that you have overpaid your last bill or a credit has been applied on your account that is more than the actual amount due. If you want to receive this negative balance back, we can arrange a refund for you within 3-5 business days or you can leave this on your account to cover you for the next month's payment.
How will I receive my bills?
We will email you your bills monthly, usually in the first week. You can also access your bill in the

Help free the world of waste and hunger
Help free the world of waste and hunger
Every single year across Australia, we waste $20 billion dollars worth of good food. As a nation, we produce enough food to feed 60 million people. At the same time, 5 million Aussies will struggle with getting the food they need at some point throughout the year. About a quarter of those are children.
Every single $1 donated to OzHarvest will enable them to deliver 2 meals to vulnerable Australians.

Families who have fled violence, war and persecution are often then stripped of their basic rights in Australia, while waiting for an outcome of their legal status. People often live this - in limbo for years. During this time, more and more people, without the right to work, become destitute.
$27 can provide a daily hot meal and food and groceries for a week.

Gift a culturally relevant book for a child in a remote community
In Australia there is a huge disparity in the literacy levels between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Many of the remote communities where the Indigenous Literacy Foundation (ILF) works report that there are few, if any, books in their homes. 
Every child in Australia, wherever they live, has the right to thrive and to excel in education. Every child should benefit from equity of opportunity. We can’t achieve justice for our First Peoples without setting First Nations children up to succeed in education. Education matters, because education opens doors.
$10 will put a culturally relevant book into the hands of a child in a remote community

Help provide children with food, water and education in disadvantaged communities
More than 260 million children worldwide aren’t receiving a quality education. Being forced out of school and into the workforce at a young age has a profound impact on a child’s life. Child labour harms their physical and mental development, and robs them of their childhood, their education, and their potential.
$70 can give 7 children school kits.
Breast cancer is on the rise - increasing by 38% in the last 10 years alone. It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the country with over 3000 Australians losing their life this year. 8 women still die from breast cancer every day.
A donation to the National Breast Cancer Foundation will support critical life-saving research to stop deaths from breast cancer.  For example $25 can contribute towards funding researchers to uncover new drugs targets for chemo-resistant breast cancer

Congenital heart disease is one of the leading causes of death of Australian babies. Eight babies are born with a heart condition in Australia every day, with 4 young lives lost each week. Congenital heart disease is the most common birth abnormality, affecting 1 in every 100 babies.

We get asked this a lot
Why should I switch to Goodtel for nbnᵀᴹ?
Good question. It's true - you could probably find a cheaper telco providing a similar quality of NBN services.
But that's not what sets us apart. At Goodtel, doing good for the planet is our top priority. And that extends from our helpful support team who'll be there for you night and day, through to the core of why we exist as a company - to support our various charity partners as they help make the planet a better place.

How long does it take to switch to the nbnᵀᴹ?
The timeframe will vary dependent on the equipment you have available at your place, and if there has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ connection.
There has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ connection at my home, and I have my own nbnᵀᴹ compatible modem
Well, that's perfect! In this case, we should be able to have you up and running in 1-3 business days. Please note, if you BYO modem, you will need to configure it for your new connection. We will send you a general guide on how to do this, but it does vary by modem.
There has been a previous nbnᵀᴹ connection at my home, but I will be purchasing a compatible modem from Goodtel

There has never been an nbnᵀᴹ connection at my home
If your address has not been connected to nbnᵀᴹ before, the standard time frame can be anywhere between 1-3 weeks and is dependent on your nbnᵀᴹ access technology type and technician availability.

Can I use my existing modem, or do I need a new one?
, in most cases yes you can. We can't guarantee every modem will work on our network but we will do our best to get you connected. If you have an old modem that isnt nbnᵀᴹ ready you can send it to us at 20/40 Meagher St, Chippendale NSW 2008 and we will arrange to have it recycled. Alternatively, your local Officeworks should be able to recycle it for you too.
Please note, if you BYO modem, you will need to configure it for your new connection. We will send you a general guide on how to do this, but it does vary by modem.
What's the difference between the modems Goodtel sell?
. It includes Wifi and is perfectly suitable for most homes.

However, if you're an individual or couple, the Casual plan is just fine. Speeds up to 21mbps should cover your needs unless you're downloading huge files.
