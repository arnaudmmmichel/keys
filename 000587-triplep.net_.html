It started as a doctoral thesis. Now Triple P has been part of more than 665 trials, studies and published papers, including more than 380 evaluation papers, 182 of which are randomized controlled trials. It's become one of the world's most-trusted parenting interventions, cited in reports by bodies such as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the United Nations.
It is used in more than 30 countries around the world – in situations ranging from individual healthcare or educational practitioners delivering directly to their own clients, to county, council, state or national jurisdictions and governments training workforces to deliver Triple P in tailored or population-based rollouts.
