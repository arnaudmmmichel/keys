We believe architecture and urban design should be a force for good.

When we’re beginning any project we come up with a few key aims, lodestars or rules that keep the focus on what is specific and important for that project. Our design practice is no different.
What makes great design good? Find out how we’ve been pushing the agenda for over 20 years.

Sustainability. At our core. From the beginning.
Since 2001 our approach to projects has always included the consideration of the planet.
Our passion for making radical change where we can still drives us today. At times, we’ve been frustrated things were moving too slowly, but we remain optimistic, we remain committed. 
We have amazing like-minded clients and consultants, governments at all levels that want to support sustainable projects and a team that have the know-how to make real, lasting impact. 
Our projects are now studied as models of sustainable buildings throughout the world.

hyper-insulated, fly-roofed house in the Northern Territory desert
civilized camping house on the NSW south coast
 where the living spaces were verandahs and extra guests were accommodated in hammocks. 
How much less can we do?
Nowadays we find ourselves working on masterplans that apply principles of sustainability to street layouts, density and open space and include landscape regeneration, museums cooled by malqafs and internal gardens and projects where the buildings 
We try to make the buildings smaller, and retain and reuse existing buildings, think about the longevity of all structures, choose the materials carefully and think about what more (or what less) we can do. 
We’ve always understood sustainability in a broad way; can the building or program be financially sustainable, can its use be sustained for more than 200 years and how can we sustain a good standard of life on this planet for as many people as possible? 
The importance that we’ve always placed on sustainability has naturally led us to work with heritage buildings and buildings for community. These types of projects have an affinity with the core ideas of sustainability because they are about longevity. 
“DunnHillam deliver a wide range of sustainability outcomes through their work. Their commitment to designing from the first principles of building science, human health, and material efficiency results in places that use less energy, feel good, and minimize their environmental footprint. Ashley and Lee's ability to collaborate with all technical design disciplines ensures that sustainability is integrated into the everyday elements of architecture and building systems, robustly and affordably. 
This is all possible in part because DunnHillam set a standard for the entire project team of collaborative, cheerful, productive working, bringing out the best of everyone on their projects. 
Ashley and Lee (and all of their team members) are the bomb.”

meta title:Approach — DunnHillam
meta description:

We are a respected architecture and urban design team that believes architecture can be a force for good. It’s this belief that informs all we do, continually challenging and inspiring us. How can we use resources more intelligently? How can we improve the lives of people through well designed buildings and places? How can clever, thoughtful architecture help solve todays challenges?
Our work is all over Australia, from the centre of Sydney to some of our most remote places. Our past and current projects include museums, art galleries, libraries, social housing, precinct wide strategic plans and adaptive reuse of heritage places. 
We take the time to genuinely know your project: your vision, the goals, the challenges and opportunities, the backstory and the place. We have the experience to make the complex processes simple, to hold our shared vision for the project and to shepherd it through to completion. We collaborate with you, with the engineers, with the planners, with the council, with the stakeholders and with the builders to create beautiful buildings for now and for the future.
Our six principles for creating places with purpose
Our projects take into consideration history, sustainability, community and equity – usually all at once. They are public, private and commercial; brand new and really old; in the city and the country; big and small. The common thread is the common good.
Diverse projects for the common good
Buildings use 39% of the world’s energy and generate 40% of the world’s carbon emissions both in their construction and in their occupation. It’s a huge challenge, but presents an equally big opportunity to make a positive difference. So our approach is always to do more for your project while having less impact on the planet.
We take a thoughtful, analytical approach, working with (rather than against) what’s already there. And because we know that places are rich with stories, meaning, identity and culture, we always work with care and sensitivity. A building is never just bricks and mortar.
And nor should the architecture. Sometimes the most powerful elements of our design work go unseen, but that doesn’t mean they don’t have impact. Even our most radical idea should feel like just the right fit – so that you can’t imagine the place without it.
Fads and fashion come and go but buildings shouldn’t. Which is why we focus on what our clients and communities really need – now and decades down the road. We love to adapt old buildings for the present and the future and we build new ones to still be loved and useful in a hundred years from now. 
Constructing a building, planning a precinct, setting a strategic framework; this work is complex, but it needn’t be painful. We’re experts in managing projects from blank page to completion, working with stakeholders, navigating policy and legislation, solving complex site issues. And we make sure the excitement of the early concepts is still there in the final outcome.
