Do you need a double appointment?  Even if you are an existing patient, you may have quite a

Bangholme is a town located in a green wedge zone, just on the fringe of Dandenong South.  The medical clinic is collocated with a large independent living village, Willow Lodge which was originally known to be Bangholme Caravan Park and has been present for over 40 years.  The clinic started off primarily servicing the needs of the residents at Willow Lodge, many of whom have lived there for decades.  However, over the years the clinic began to support the expanding industrial precinct of Dandenong South providing workplace health services.  In addition to this, since Atticus Health Carrum is located conveniently 10 minutes up the road, and some doctors practice between the two sites, there are patients who come from there as well.
Dandenong itself is a massively growing city that has been humming along since the 1840s.  The Dandenong post office was first opened on 1 July 1848 and the famed Dandenong Market began trading in 1866.  Dandenong Creek has proved to be a great resource for the town and much grazing has occurred in the area in the past.  The railway station opened 8 October 1877.
The success of Dandenong South in particular, as an industrial engine room of Australia continues to grow.  In recent times, a direct rail freight between the Port of Melbourne and Dandenong South has received approval.  This is set to create an inland port and it further bolsters the future capacity of the area.
Atticus Health Bangholme is excited and optimistic to be a part of this bright future and we look forward to collaborating with local industry to provide a safer, healthier working environment for all.  And of course, we continue to gladly service the varied needs of the local resident population at Willow Lodge, a place we jointly share and love.
Well, I guess it all started in 2010 when I saw the old “Boatshed Café” for sale across the road from Carrum Station. The house behind the café was being sold with it. I took a walk down to the Patterson River, fell in love with the whole thing, signed away and thought, this is beautiful.
Business plan – what business plan?
When it comes to healthcare, from the outset, we consider first the whole person or organisation, their goals and aspirations. A deep understanding of that allows for the best decisions and outcomes to be reached in partnership after all. With this mentality, we’ve been able to grow. Grow, yet stay humble, still.
The areas we have grown into reflect areas in which we think we can make a real difference and feel highly motivated to be involved with. These areas are:
Medical clinics.  We run several GP clinics.  This is where we started and continue to persevere, always striving for improvement.
Corporate health.  We are happy to work with motivated workplaces to help maximise the health outcomes of their employee base.  We consider that workplaces have relevance to and potential input in the health and well being of a community.  We conduct our corporate health services with due independence and impartiality, yet at the same time seek to foster a mutual sense of purpose and transparent communication for the benefit of all parties.
Aged Care.  We consider the frail and elderly to be particular members of the community who we have a responsibility to care for.  From humble beginnings we have grown to supply GP services to nearly 1000 patients living in retirement villages and nursing homes around Melbourne.  In particular we are the main provider of GP services to nursing homes on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.  Within aged care, our mission is to deliver a 24/7 medical service. We coordinate this by accepting all calls anytime via 1800 ATTICUS (1800 288 4287).  Through the cultivation of a strong reputation for quality and compassion over many years, we have seen this area of our business grow substantially.
Telehealth.  By attending to matters in a flexible manner by the exchange of images or conversation digitally, we have grown accustomed to creating solutions remotely.  This concept, “Telehealth”, does improve efficiency, accessibility and timeliness of health care.  It is for this reason that we now offer telehealth services nationwide – it simply makes good sense.
One thing has remained constant throughout, that is, our commitment to getting to know and understand communities. As a provider of medical services, fundamentally we learn so much about the fabric of a community. We share in its ups and downs. As such, we feel compelled to promote deeper, meaningful community spirit. And, we recognise how great an impact this potentially and actually has on the outcomes of health – for the individual and for the collective. Our story then, is very much that of being one with the community.

Atticus Health Bittern Clinic - Our History
Bittern is a town within the area known as Western Port on the Mornington Peninsula.  Its name comes from the Australasian Bittern, a local wetland bird.  The Bittern post office opened in 1891 and the town has a local primary school, Bittern Primary School which has origins dating back to 1916.  The town also has a railway station and shopping centre, Bitternfields.
Bittern is a place that retains a country town feels, yet wanting to grow all the same.  In recent times, since many people are choosing to live on the Mornington Peninsula, Bittern is home to many new families.  As well as this, a large retirement village has been built just behind Bitternfields which has also added many new residents to the area.
Atticus Health Bittern is located within the shopping centre, close to the pharmacy.  It’s a clinic that caters to the needs of locals, young and old.  A few interesting facts about the clinic at Bittern is that the founder of Atticus Health, Dr Floyd Gomes would love to take a long drive to clear his head at times, and did so one day, driving down to Flinders.  Enroute, in passing through Bittern, he found it to be such a quant town, he stopped off at the shopping centre and saw a shop for lease.  Further enquiry revealed that the shop was planned to be a medical clinic, with the deal having fallen through.  Eureka – he loved the idea and took it up.  Then, during the build, the founder of Atticus Health had to attend to family illness, and as a result one of the nurses, Helen, had to step up and basically manage the project through to completion.  Which she thankfully did, allowing Atticus Health Bittern to get up and running in February 2016.
Well, I guess it all started in 2010 when I saw the old “Boatshed Café” for sale across the road from Carrum Station. The house behind the café was being sold with it. I took a walk down to the Patterson River, fell in love with the whole thing, signed away and thought, this is beautiful.

We generally deal with all sorts of medical issues. However, if you have a particular need, please call us and we’re happy to discuss which practitioner or service might best be able to help you.
Here are a few tips to consider when making an appointment, so that you can get the greatest benefit from the experience:

Do you need a double appointment?  Even if you are an existing patient, you may have quite a

This is where it all began.  Our founder, Dr Floyd Gomes ambitiously and naively converted and connected a café and adjoining 3 bedroom house and voila – Atticus Health Carrum was born on March 25, 2013.  Since that time, the clinic has become a solid resource for the local population.  It is located across the road from Carrum Station which has recenlty seen major change since the railway crossing was removed.  Next door to the clinic is Freddie’s Café, another popular meeting place for locals.
In 2017 Atticus Health Carrum won the prestigious award of General Practice of the Year, from the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP).  This is the peak industry body for general practices in Australia.  We were proud to win this award and grateful for the support of the local community in supporting our “start up” to get there.
As a town, Carrum has a rich history, one that would be incomplete without mention of the Carrum Cowboys, who was a group of up to 20 teenagers aged 13 to 17 who, in the 1950s would ride their horses through the area and meet at Stanley Street on a regular basis.  That group inspired the name of the present day local football club, the Carrum Cowboys.  Atticus Health Carrum has enjoyed a positive association with the Carrum Cowboys over the years, jointly advocating for various men’s health causes and embarking on health promotion activities.
Carrum is a warm and friendly place where the waiting room seems to buzz with an atmosphere of its own. With a coffee shop as our neighbour, river and beach up the road, we love being here. We hope that Atticus Carrum becomes a place you can turn to – whenever you need help and to help you achieve the life you want to live.
Well, I guess it all started in 2010 when I saw the old “Boatshed Café” for sale across the road from Carrum Station. The house behind the café was being sold with it. I took a walk down to the Patterson River, fell in love with the whole thing, signed away and thought, this is beautiful.
Business plan – what business plan?
When it comes to healthcare, from the outset, we consider first the whole person or organisation, their goals and aspirations. A deep understanding of that allows for the best decisions and outcomes to be reached in partnership after all. With this mentality, we’ve been able to grow. Grow, yet stay humble, still.
The areas we have grown into reflect areas in which we think we can make a real difference and feel highly motivated to be involved with. These areas are:
Medical clinics.  We run several GP clinics.  This is where we started and continue to persevere, always striving for improvement.
Corporate health.  We are happy to work with motivated workplaces to help maximise the health outcomes of their employee base.  We consider that workplaces have relevance to and potential input in the health and well being of a community.  We conduct our corporate health services with due independence and impartiality, yet at the same time seek to foster a mutual sense of purpose and transparent communication for the benefit of all parties.
Aged Care.  We consider the frail and elderly to be particular members of the community who we have a responsibility to care for.  From humble beginnings we have grown to supply GP services to nearly 1000 patients living in retirement villages and nursing homes around Melbourne.  In particular we are the main provider of GP services to nursing homes on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.  Within aged care, our mission is to deliver a 24/7 medical service. We coordinate this by accepting all calls anytime via 1800 ATTICUS (1800 288 4287).  Through the cultivation of a strong reputation for quality and compassion over many years, we have seen this area of our business grow substantially.
Telehealth.  By attending to matters in a flexible manner by the exchange of images or conversation digitally, we have grown accustomed to creating solutions remotely.  This concept, “Telehealth”, does improve efficiency, accessibility and timeliness of health care.  It is for this reason that we now offer telehealth services nationwide – it simply makes good sense.
One thing has remained constant throughout, that is, our commitment to getting to know and understand communities. As a provider of medical services, fundamentally we learn so much about the fabric of a community. We share in its ups and downs. As such, we feel compelled to promote deeper, meaningful community spirit. And, we recognise how great an impact this potentially and actually has on the outcomes of health – for the individual and for the collective. Our story then, is very much that of being one with the community.

Hamilton Island is a unique place.  It’s absolutely beautiful, and yet being an island presents challenges in the provision of medical services.  Atticus Health is happy to meet that challenge to be the provider of medical services to both locals and guests alike.  And, we’re also happy to support Hamilton Island Enterprises help the island thrive and have a positive, long term future.
The history of Hamilton Island dates back to Captain Cook who first encountered the Whitsunday Passage.  Tourism started to enter the region in the 1920s.  Then in the 1970s, Keith Williams, together with his business partner Bryan Byrt purchased the grazing lease on Hamilton Island.  He liked the island because for one, he noticed that it had north facing beaches, which was rare for the east coast of Australia.  In 1978 Bryan Byrt passed away and instead of using the island for grazing, Keith Williams decided to build a tourist resort.
In 2003 Robert Oatley was cruising his yacht passed Hamilton Island when he noticed the airport being built and he fell in love with the concept and took over ownership from Keith Williams.  Robert Oatley passed away in 2016.  Since that time the Oatley family has continued to maintain improve Hamilton Island, making it an amazing tropical island holiday destination.
Hamilton Island is about 5 square kilometres, with a total population of some 5000 people, half of these comprise local residents and staff with the other half made up of guests.  Atticus Health Hamilton Island is the only medical clinic on the island.  Queensland Ambulance Service also have a station on the island and we work together.

As one of our patients reflected online: ‘The amazing lady at the front desk!” After 35 years at William Street...
Melbourne was first founded in 1835 and went on to boom in the 1850s after gold was found at Ballarat and Bendigo.
Atticus Health Hardware Lane opened in March 2022 after moving from their location at William Street Clinic.
Since 1982 William Street Clinic (as it was known prior to being a part of Atticus Health) has catered to the specific needs of people who work in the city who need to see a doctor. The clinic was started by Dr Harry Imber and Dr Kaz Czuba.  Kaz retired in 2019, Harry in 2021, leaving Enza (the receptionist of some 36 years) to continue her good work.
Atticus Health took over William Street Clinic in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic left Melbourne CBD largely empty. The Atticus team instantly resonated with the caring culture and quality driven ethos of the clinic and sought to become a part of its rich history, and indeed ensure that its future was intact and strong.
In March of 2022, William Street Clinic, along with its staff, made the big move to Hardware Lane, in the CBD.
These days, the clinic continues to serve the needs of city folk and has been particularly famed for running on time, which is very helpful to the busy professionals who use the service. Patients attend for day to day needs and many benefit from an annual health review.
Apart from those who come to Melbourne city to work, there is a 184,000 resident population with a median age of 28 years. A city of coffee aficionados, interestingly there are 2390 cafes and restaurants in Melbourne city! It also has the largest tram system in the world, outside of Europe, and, according to the Crimes Act 1958, if you meet with a pirate in Melbourne, you must not trade with them!
Well, I guess it all started in 2010 when I saw the old “Boatshed Café” for sale across the road from Carrum Station. The house behind the café was being sold with it. I took a walk down to the Patterson River, fell in love with the whole thing, signed away and thought, this is beautiful.

Atticus Regional Medicentre is fortunately located on a main thoroughfare, Frankston Flinders Road.  This makes our service available to many people who drive passed, heading either north or south down as far as Flinders.  In this way, our clinic has opened its doors and welcome a truly varied patient base.
We opened the clinic in September 2016 as a brand new facility.  We still remember our first patient Joe, walking in before the build was even complete.  Back then the garden was humble, but nevertheless, we had planted lots of native trees, to provide a generous green border to the considerable carpark.  These days, that garden has flourished, as has the clinic, with 
Hastings has always been a fascinating place and was originally known as King’s Creek.  It’s a place that has a rich history.  The post office opened in 1863.  Fishing was an early industry and many people continue to bring their boats and launch them off Hastings marina till this day.  Indeed, Western Port Bay brings a good catch to many.
These days, Hastings has continued to build as an industrial town.  It is home to Bluescope Steel and Esso as well as home to a steadily increasing list of other enterprises.  Apart from businesses, many people are choosing to live in Hastings.  This includes a significant number of retirees.
Well, I guess it all started in 2010 when I saw the old “Boatshed Café” for sale across the road from Carrum Station. The house behind the café was being sold with it. I took a walk down to the Patterson River, fell in love with the whole thing, signed away and thought, this is beautiful.
Business plan – what business plan?
When it comes to healthcare, from the outset, we consider first the whole person or organisation, their goals and aspirations. A deep understanding of that allows for the best decisions and outcomes to be reached in partnership after all. With this mentality, we’ve been able to grow. Grow, yet stay humble, still.
The areas we have grown into reflect areas in which we think we can make a real difference and feel highly motivated to be involved with. These areas are:
Medical clinics.  We run several GP clinics.  This is where we started and continue to persevere, always striving for improvement.
Corporate health.  We are happy to work with motivated workplaces to help maximise the health outcomes of their employee base.  We consider that workplaces have relevance to and potential input in the health and well being of a community.  We conduct our corporate health services with due independence and impartiality, yet at the same time seek to foster a mutual sense of purpose and transparent communication for the benefit of all parties.
Aged Care.  We consider the frail and elderly to be particular members of the community who we have a responsibility to care for.  From humble beginnings we have grown to supply GP services to nearly 1000 patients living in retirement villages and nursing homes around Melbourne.  In particular we are the main provider of GP services to nursing homes on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria.  Within aged care, our mission is to deliver a 24/7 medical service. We coordinate this by accepting all calls anytime via 1800 ATTICUS (1800 288 4287).  Through the cultivation of a strong reputation for quality and compassion over many years, we have seen this area of our business grow substantially.
Telehealth.  By attending to matters in a flexible manner by the exchange of images or conversation digitally, we have grown accustomed to creating solutions remotely.  This concept, “Telehealth”, does improve efficiency, accessibility and timeliness of health care.  It is for this reason that we now offer telehealth services nationwide – it simply makes good sense.
One thing has remained constant throughout, that is, our commitment to getting to know and understand communities. As a provider of medical services, fundamentally we learn so much about the fabric of a community. We share in its ups and downs. As such, we feel compelled to promote deeper, meaningful community spirit. And, we recognise how great an impact this potentially and actually has on the outcomes of health – for the individual and for the collective. Our story then, is very much that of being one with the community.
