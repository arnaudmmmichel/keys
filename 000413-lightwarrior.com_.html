Invest consciously to leave the world a better place
Light Warrior is the Melbourne-based family office and investment group for the Sali family, established in 2016 following the sale of Swisse Wellness. At the time Radek Sali was CEO and a major shareholder of Swisse Wellness, which was sold to Biostime International Holdings for $2.1bn. Light Warrior CEO and CIO, Adam Gregory, led the sale process on behalf of Goldman Sachs as their Head of Australian Consumer, Retail and Healthcare.
Following the completion of the sale in September 2015, Radek and Adam founded Light Warrior with a view to pursue Radek’s vision of investing the proceeds of the sale in a responsible and purposeful way.
Central to all Light Warrior Group investment decisions is its shared value ethos: that business growth is only sustainable in the long-term if it benefits all stakeholders, and that business has a responsibility to make positive contributions to society as a whole.
Seek profit in a responsible and purposeful way
Actively give back to our community
Empower and develop our people to achieve their potential
Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.
Together the B Corp community envisage a world where businesses strive to better the world, the lives of the people living in it, and the natural environment on which our quality of life depends.
Today there are over 4,200  Certified B Corps around the globe. We’re proud to be aligned with them in redefining success in business so that one day everyone uses business as a force for good.
