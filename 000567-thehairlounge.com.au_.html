The service provided at The Hair Lounge is absolutely wonderful! The staff are lovely and extremely skilled at what they do. They listen to all your hair needs and leave you feeling like your most beautiful and best self. The fact that they are a sustainable salon is just a cherry on the top!
I love The Hair Lounge! Isobel and her team make you feel welcome from the second you walk in the door and leave you feeling the most beautiful version of yourself; both inside and out when you’re finished. Their hair products are to die for, and the quality of your hair treatment/cut/colour is next level. My hair is the healthiest it has ever been, my colour so radiant and my smile so big thanks to the magic that these wonderful humans have done to my head. I will always recommend The Hair Lounge to anyone who needs it and will forever be a client of this beautiful hair salon.
A trip to the Hair Lounge is like meet up with your best friend. The staff are incredibly welcoming, the environment is absolutely positive and you will leave not only with a fabulous new hairstyle but feeling refreshed, revitalised and ready to take on the world. 
The Hair Lounge always provides fantastic service in a welcoming environment. The staff are warm, inviting, knowledgeable, and fabulous. Every visit boosts my mood and nourishes my soul, as well as making me feel attractive, fresh and fierce.
What first drew me to this gorgeous salon was their sustainable practices and now I stick around for the incredible service and absolutely lovely stylists. The Hair Lounge is the most welcoming salon I have ever experienced. It’s so refreshing to see an entire team of people working in an environment and with other people that they clearly love. On top of this beautiful atmosphere, I am always confident in the stylists’ abilities to turn my hair into something magical. Friends often comment on the quality and naturalness of my foils. And the pricing is super reasonable, particularly compared to other sustainable salons that charge an arm and a leg. I consistently come out of this salon feeling fresh, relaxed and beautiful. Thank you to the wonderful team x
I always look forward to getting my hair done at the Hair Lounge. The staff are welcoming and highly skilled, and my hair always looks and feels amazing when I leave. I have thin blonde hair, and Isobel is a magician who manages to make it look much thicker than it is. I highly recommend this salon.
Isobel and the team at The Hair Lounge are community focused and environmentally driven in every aspect of their business. The staff are transparent and highly ethical when it comes to explaining their products. I am extremely impressed with their focus and attention to bio and ethical trade goods and truly believe Isobel puts her people first, before profit, and creates a wonderful workplace for staff and clientele alike.
