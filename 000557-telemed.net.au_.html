What is a Business of Tomorrow?
Businesses of Tomorrow is a program designed to reward and recognise businesses with the drive to shape Australia’s future. These businesses may be large or small and they don’t need to be a Westpac customer, however they all share the following strengths:
Demonstrate a clear purpose and vision.
Have the capability to meet tomorrow’s challenges.
TeleMed was proud to be accepted as a certified B Corp in 2016. B Corporations represent an emerging group of companies that are using the power of business to create a positive impact on the world and generate a shared and durable prosperity for all. 
We were delighted that TeleMed was selected as a finalist in the Western Australian Telstra Business Awards in 2014 which recognised our team’s efforts in the field of telenuclear medicine and the delivery of services for rural populations who would otherwise need to travel to Perth for sophisticated oncology and cardiac imaging.
In 2011, we were recognised as one of Western Australia’s 40 leading business entrepreneurs under 40. 
The 40under40 Awards program is designed to recognise and celebrate Western Australia's 40 leading business entrepreneurs under the age of 40.
 The program recognises not only personal determination and commercial drive, but also the philanthropic pursuits recognising the less public contributions to the welfare of Western Australia.
All of our imaging departments have achieved full accreditation against the full suite of standards under Diagnostic Accreditation Imaging Scheme. This ensures medicare benefits are payable for all of our nuclear medicine services listed in the Diagnostic Imaging Services Table (DIST). 
CSIRO’s Scientists in Schools is a national program that creates and supports long-term partnerships between teachers and scientists or mathematicians. TeleMed volunteers time to run interactive, educational sessions to high school students at all levels. Covering topics such as medical applications in nuclear physics, anatomy and the physiology of disease, the aim is to spark the student’s interest in a career in science through real life patient diagnoses and treatment.
The purpose of RAINS is to offer a support network for rural and remote Nuclear Medicine professionals. The support network aims to engage with and develop strategies to overcome the unique professional difficulties encountered in rural and remote Australia. We were co-founders of RAINS in 2007 and Peter was past-president.

For several years TeleMed has provided a generous, privately funded scholarship for 4 year intern undergraduates. We developed a co-located training syllabus telehealth based program, specific to rural nuclear medicine practitioners.
All aspects pertaining to the workflow of the nuclear medicine service from QA/QC to clinician referral, scheduling, preparation, imaging procedures and delivery of results.  
During the initial period of the program, the trainee focus is on core competencies with mixed caseload session’s predominately in radiopharmacy, radionuclide administration techniques, scanning protocols and processing. Thereafter, a stronger emphasis is applied to other operational requirements such as scheduling, teleradiology, medicare and clinician liaison. The trainee actively participates with virtual interprofessional case reviews, educational sessions and submits interesting cases for a rural conference. 
The scholarship includes financial support towards relocation, car, accommodation and conference attendance. This placement has ensured candidates are well equipped for a career in this important area of diagnostic medicine.

We were pleased to be advised that our application for the Rural Health Outreach Fund (RHOF) was again successful for the 2017-2020 funding round. This grant goes towards supporting our Kalgoorlie and Geraldton telenuclear medicine services, which are significantly more expensive to operate due to the significantly higher operational costs in FIFO travel, radioisotope delivery and staffing.
RHOF supports outreach activities that address health issues identified in regional, rural and remote locations. This fund places a specific emphasis on the following health priorities; maternity and paediatric health, eye health, mental health and support for chronic disease management.
Providing access to specialised medical services reduces the patient’s need to travel long distances to attend a consultation or receive treatment, meaning they can stay close to their home and family. Rural Health West administers outreach services on behalf of the Australian Government Department of Health.

Nuclear medicine imaging uses small amounts of radioactive materials called radiotracers that are injected into the bloodstream. The radiotracer travels through the area being examined and gives off energy which is detected by a special camera to create images of your body. The special camera and imaging techniques used in nuclear medicine include the gamma camera with single-photon emission-computed tomography that is interfaced with a low dose CT scanner (SPECT/CT).
Nuclear medicine imaging provides unique information and offers the potential to identify disease in its earliest stages. Nuclear medicine scans have helped improved millions of lives over the past 50 years. Apart from an injection of radiotracer, nuclear medicine scans are non-invasive and safe. The amounts of radioactivity administered are relatively small and are designed to provide the highest quality diagnostic information possible while minimizing the radiation dose.
You can go about your day as normal after any nuclear medicine scan. 
Tell your doctor if there’s a possibility you are pregnant or breastfeeding and discuss any recent illnesses, medical conditions, allergies and medications you’re taking. 
Your results will be ready between 2-7 business days. Our nuclear medicine technologists, scientists and physicians will process your scans and create report which is then sent directly to your doctor. Your doctor will discuss the report with you when you have your next appointment. 
OUR NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND IMAGING SERVICES
These scans allow visualisation of blood flow through your heart to detect any areas of poor blood flow or ischemia. They involve a resting phase and a stress phase which allow doctors to compare the blood flow to your heart when you are at rest and when you exercise.  
These scans are used to find fractures, infections or loosening of prosthetics, or to identify metastatic bone disease.  
A thyroid scan is used to assess the function of your thyroid to see if it is over or under active. It is also used to identify abnormalities such as nodules.  
This scan is used to show us the size, shape and location of your 4 parathyroid glands which sit very closely to your thyroid scan in your neck.  Like the thyroid gland, the parathyroid glands produce hormones and this scan is used to check if they are over or under active. 
Lung perfusion scans are used to detect pulmonary abnormalities such as pulmonary embolisms, bronchial carcinoma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Renal scintigraphy scans are used to evaluate your kidneys’ function, anatomy and drainage of the urinary system to identify any blockages or functional abnormalities.  
A HIDA scan, or Hepatobiliary scan is used to capture images of the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and small intestine to help diagnose medical conditions related to those organs such as cholecystitis, bile duct blockages, bile leaks and fistulas, or abnormal connections between different organs.
Lymphoscintigraphy is an imaging technique used to identify the lymph drainage and lymph nodes that drain tumours in your lymphatic system. Radiotracer flow through the lymphatic system can also help identify points of blockages or lymphedema.
A Gated Heart Pool Scan is a scan that helps determine how efficiently a part of your heart called the ventricles is contracting. 
A Gallium Scan is used to detect and assess the extent of any infections in the body, as well as certain types of cancer such as Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, and Sarcoidosis.
A DEXA Bone Mineral Density Scan is determines how rich your bones are in minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. The higher the mineral content, the denser and stronger your bones are
A DEXA body composition scan is used to determine relative masses of fat, muscle and bone to provide insight into your body composition and improve fitness outcomes. You do not need a referral from a doctor to book this scan.
A full suite of additional nuclear medicine examinations are available.
