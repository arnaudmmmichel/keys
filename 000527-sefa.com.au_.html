Make the world better and enjoy financial return through our investment opportunities that mobilise social impact capital. Explore our three investment avenues.
Wholesale impact investors can diversify risk and impact by investing debt into our funding pool, the Sefa Loan Fund, which provides Sefa loans to a wide range of purpose-driven organisations.
Government, philanthropy and foundations can provide strategic grants to purpose-driven organisations that can't afford a loan for their entire financial needs leveraging grant dollars with our loan products.
For targeted return and impact, investors can invest alongside Sefa or as part of a larger syndicate. We originate, structure and monitor these to help successful purpose driven organisations grow.
Georgina Byron AM, Chief Executive Officer of The Snow Foundation
“Sefa is a leader in social impact and a great pleasure to work with – reliable, professional, and with strong expertise. We appreciate their openness to discuss new opportunities and pleased to have joined them in the Jigsaw investment syndicate and shared intelligence on their work on Tender Funerals.”

Partnering for a healthier, more resilient planet
Making sure all regenerative businesses can get the funding they need means looking beyond Australia’s small pool of philanthropic investments. And this requires different skills sets, helping organisations put governance frameworks in place and get investment ready. 
While Sustainable Table don’t have these skills internally, it collaborates with partner organisations like Sefa to fill any gaps.
The time is now for a new paradigm of investing, where growth is not the main indicator for success, but instead we see transformational ecological, social and cultural changes at the pace necessary to arrest the impact of climate.

We are Sefa and Sefa Partnerships
We partner with organisations and investors to unlock social impact.
While supporting the growth and resilience of purpose-driven organisations, we generate positive returns for investors.
We lend directly to purpose-driven organisations who need between $200,000 and 2 million in capital, considering the organisation’s capacity to repay a loan. We offer impact investors the opportunity to invest for diversification of risk and impact.
Impact investors can target return and impact by participating in larger projects, alongside Sefa or in syndicates facilitated by us.
Partnering with philanthropy and government, we leverage the grant dollar with our loan products, to design manageable financial solutions for purpose-driven organisations.
We strengthen purpose-driven organisations’ resilience across strategy, impact and governance, often helping them get investment ready and pursue capital options.
We build personalised learning programs and capital partnerships that unlock the potential of impact organisations across Australia.
Our bespoke personal and professional learning programs for corporate partners and government help bring social enterprise thinking into these sectors.
We enable our partners to use philanthropic funds to develop their impact work, whilst offering organisations access to networks and providing guidance on theory of change strengthening their overall organisational capacity.
We bring a philanthropic component to loans on Sefa’s balance sheet, enabling accessible capital resources for purpose driven organisations.
We apply our learning and human centred design knowledge to run bespoke educational sessions and programs for purpose driven organisations, supporting Sefa’s technical work.
Sefa (Social Enterprise Finance Australia) was established in 2011 when it was selected by the Australian Government to receive funding from its Social Enterprise Development and Investment Fund (SEDIF). On top of the $10 million grant, another $10 million was raised via equity investors and lenders.  
Sefa Partnerships was established by Sefa as a public benevolent institution in 2016 to boost the resources available for social enterprises supporting disadvantaged communities across Australia.  
Since establishment, Sefa has unlocked more than $100 million of capital from the impact investing sector. The Sefa team has disbursed $40 million in loans through almost 50 deals.  
Sefa’s work continues across impact areas including crisis & affordable housing, education, arts, community enterprises, Indigenous and disability organisations. 
Since 2016 Sefa Partnerships have unlocked capital and capability resources for more than 80 purpose driven social enterprises and 100 social entrepreneurs. Their work has helped leverage an additional $1.5 million into the sector for the ongoing development and support of organisations transforming and relieving disadvantage.  
Sefa and Sefa Partnerships work collaboratively and share a joint strategy for the continued growth of purpose-driven organisations across Australia.
We’re so much more than an investor. Think of us as a collaborator with the experience and expertise to help your organisation achieve its purpose and financial goals. We’ll walk beside you on your path to becoming a sustainable organisation and offer support well beyond finance.
We are transparent about our motivations, influences, intentions, and limitations. We don’t leave you in the dark about how or why a decision has been made. We tell the truth, even when it might be uncomfortable or lead to a change in plans. We are committed to our principles and take responsibility for our actions.
We champion others and amplify impact through real life examples. We advocate for systems change and put this into practice by supporting our clients. Our work aims to change mindsets and instigate conversations to challenge the sector including ourselves.
