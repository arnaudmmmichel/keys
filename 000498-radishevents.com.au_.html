We are a boutique Sydney Caterer on a mission to deliver boldly delicious food, with an ethical approach to our sourcing, cooking and service.
We love good food. And if you’re like us, you know that it brings people together, creates lasting memories, and fills the soul (and our tummies). We make food that people want to eat.
We all need to take more responsibility for the resources we use. So we’ve made a commitment to reduce waste in our whole operation (zero to landfill is our mission). 
Now more than ever we need to support each other, so we collab with local businesses that share our philosophy. We support them, they support us, we support you. Win-win-win.
“It was the most perfect day, honestly went so well! Thanks for all your help and for making it so not stressful! People have said the food was hands down the best food they have ever eaten at an event and people have whole cheese station albums on their phones which is hilarious.”
“Hilary it was AMAZING!!! We had people walking past the wharf looking in and asking who had catered! Thanks again and Merry Christmas to you and the team. Absolutely amazing job, yet again!
“Everything was really delicious! My favourite was the brisket with romesco and the Gem Lettuce! Everyone commented on those two the most from what I heard. I even recreated the salad on the weekend for a gathering.

What some of our couples have said
(check out all our Google Reviews 
"I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Radish Events! We engaged them to do the catering for our wedding for 70 people. The menu was divine, the support and customer service was excellent. Hilary was so supportive and helpful throughout the whole process of wedding planning. She was so solutions focused and helped me navigate multiple dietary requirements :P. On the night, we got so many compliments about the dinner. The miso wasabi trout was a hit. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. And to top it off, Radish Events are a B-Corp company! What's not to love? Thank you Radish Events for making our wedding night a success!"
From the start we were attracted to the sustainable ethos of Radish and their share plate style - little did we know how truly delicious the food would be and that it would become a central talking point of the wedding!
Henri and Hilary were a dream team to work with – navigating the difficult logistics of an at-home wedding, adjusting the menu to meet our preferences and providing incredible service staff.
Never has such delicious food been served from our garage!
Here’s a bit more info on our Wedding Catering services. If you’re keen on finding out more about what we do and how we can help you with your event, 
At Radish Events, we believe there is an inextricable link between the way produce is cultivated and treated, and the way it tastes on your plate. As such, we endeavour to source our produce locally, from farmers who raise their livestock on pastures, and minimise the use of chemicals and pesticides.
We hope the care we put into the sourcing and preparing our food, gives you an indication of the care and love we put into your wedding service. We work with like-minded industry experts (aka legends), to be able to offer you more than just wedding catering, but also bar & drinks, party hire, styling, floristry and even recommend wedding planners. 
And one more thing before you get started, we’re a certified BCorp catering company (the first one in Australia), a new kind of business that values purpose over profit, and since 2017, we set ourselves the ridiculously bold challenge of designing waste out of our operation entirely. We’re proud to be your go-to ethical wedding caterers in Sydney. 
            Driven by High Quality, Local and Sustainable Food
As one of the best wedding catering in Sydney, we are on a mission to deliver boldly delicious food that is made ethically and sustainably. 
It's a simple formula, really: use the best seasonal produce available from our local suppliers to create thoughtful dishes. No bulking agents, no "looks pretty but tastes meh" and no waste. We like to create dishes that turn the waste component upside down and transform it into the highlight of the dish.
