We have been planting trees since 2016. Today, thanks for our community, we have now planted over 780 acres worth of trees. Why? Because we want to invest in a healthy environment for our future generations.
Thanks to our community we have contributed 2.5m trees, 1002 acres Forest Gardens*. Pulled in 145k tons of carbon and changed over 12k lives. That’s a whole lot of impact.
*average of 4000 trees per forest garden
Degraded farmland is tranformed into Forest Gardens
Large areas of soil is tranformed from dust to fertile land
Trees create long lasting carbon sinks that store carbon pulled from the atmosphere
Families grow organic food source within the trees, which also produces income
Local community members enter a four-year training program to turn degraded land into a fertile Forest Garden (FGA). Developed by our impact partner Trees For The Future who have 30 years of experience of planting trees across the globe. This focus on training creates a long lasting, balanced ecos-systems that are cared for for generations.
Forest Gardens are truly unique. They deliver on three key outcomes; People, Planet & Profit (3Ps). This holistic approach sets them apart from other tree-planting programs. Forest Gardens allow communities to plant their way out of poverty.
Increasing biodiversity improves the soil, which increases the food production capability of the field, all without using harmful chemicals. Helping families become food secure with time. 
Forest Gardens are constantly absorbing carbon. Trees are planted to fix nitrogen in the soil, bringing it back to life and creating lasting carbon sinks. Families learn land management and conservation to optimize the long-term health and productivity of the land.
Profit is what closes the loop. As carbon declines, the trees’ nitrogen repairs the soil and the yield goes up. The families can begin to sell their excess food supplies at local markets. And, as profits increase, these families are introduced to the final stage of the program; financial literacy. Financial literacy enables each family to gain access to loans and lend money to further their farming profits.
We visited some of Forest Garden projects to see the impact first hand.
