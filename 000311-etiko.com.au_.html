We do ask that you provide us with a photo of the item that clearly shows the fault.
Etiko does not take responsibility for items that are damaged through misuse or poor care. For all garments including underwear, please follow the instructions on the care label and packaging. For sneakers and shoes, we recommend the following care:
Note that our sneakers, shoes and thongs are intended for casual wear, and are not built to withstand heavy duty wear and tear such as hiking, building/industrial job sites or sporting activities.
Test the cleaning process on a section of the shoe which is not visible such as the inside of the tongue or sole. This is to ensure that the cleaning product used does not affect the colour or material
Cotton Canvas: using a damp cloth, rub gently with lukewarm water and a mild soap or detergent. Do not machine wash or dry.
Rubber: using a cloth, rub gently with lukewarm water and a mild soap or detergent. Alternatively you could use a leather spray – we recommend spraying the cleaning cloth, not the rubber as it may also touch the canvas and cause discolouration. Do not machine wash or dry.
Dry at room temperature, stuff with tissue paper to help maintain their shape. Do not tumble dry or place close to heat source such as a hair dryer, hand dryer or heater.
Want to give Etiko as a gift? Buy any Etiko gift card, and spread the ethical love! Our gift cards start at a value of $50 and run up to $300, and are redeemable on all of our products online.
