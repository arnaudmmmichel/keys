Bioremediation solutions for the on-site treatment of the most recalcitrant soil pollutions
We exploit the detoxifying capacities of fungi, also called mushrooms, to deliver competitive and tailored remediation solutions addressing problematic soil pollutions.
Mycoremediation, an on site bioremediation technology
We design and implement the on site biological treatment of excavated polluted soil
We take care of soil monitoring activities
Because each soil remediation project comes with a unique set of challenges, we perform laboratory testing on your soil to choose and optimize the best mycoremediation strategy.
To know more about mycoremediation go to our dedicated page
When is mycoremediation the best option?
When the concentrations and types of contaminants cannot effectively be tackled by classic biological, physical, chemical and thermal technologies.
When transportation cost of contaminated soil to treatment centers becomes prohibitive.
When a risk reduction initiative needs to be implemented on old industrial sites and brownfields.
For a competitive on site treatment option to tackle the most recalcitrant soil pollutants.
For an improved environmental impact: mycoremediation is less energy intensive and disruptive to soil than physico-chemical and thermal treatment technologies.

Soil mycoremediation is a bioremediation process during which a contaminated soil is being treated by and cured through the action of fungal metabolism. Its implementation consists of the on site treatment of excavated soil via fungal bioaugmentation within a biopile.
Fungi, or more commonly called mushrooms, are a diverse group of organisms and are ubiquitous in the environment. They can exist and survive in almost every habitat, and play vital roles in all ecosystems. Nowadays, their contribution extends to various industrial purposes.
In particular, wood-decay fungi have the remarkable ability to degrade the most recalcitrant molecules produced in nature, such as wood lignin. It has been discovered that those mushrooms produce enzymes that are also able to degrade recalcitrant man-made chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heavy mineral oil hydrocarbons (C10-C40) and other toxic xenobiotics. Thus, this bioremediation process constitutes an interesting solution to restore industrial and historically polluted sites.

Biomimicry or bio-inspiration is an innovation process encouraging the transfer of ideas, concepts and strategies inspired from the living world, with the objective of designing human applications aiming at sustainable development. Over 3.8 billions of years of trials and errors, natural ecosystems have developed evolutionary optimized biological structures, functions, processes and strategies to solve complex problems, providing an endless source of inspiration for the cleantech sector.
"Look deep into nature, and then you will understand everything better."

NOVOBIOM founding team members have complementary expertises in sustainable development consultancy and biomimicry. Their past professional activities include research in the fields of Life Science & Environment, Innovation and Business Management.
Dr. Caroline Zaoui, CTO, is a microbiologist with a strong taste for disruptive bio-inspired innovation and environmental sustainability. As a former Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow, Caroline holds a PhD degree in microbiology from the Hannover Medical School (Germany); her previous scientific fields of investigation include bacterial cell-cell communication, expression of bacterial resistance genes to antibiotics and carbon
biosequestration. Applying bio-inspiration and her expertise to develop bioinspired carbon trapping biotechnologies during a past experience within a consultancy firm, Caroline now leads NOVOBIOM research and innovation activities as CSO and co-founder.
Committed to sustainability since his childhood and passionate about innovation, Jean-Michel dedicates himself to the promotion and the development of bio-inspired innovative solutions.
Business engineer with an additional master in environmental science and management, Jean-Michel worked for various companies in sustainability related issues or sectors such as natural disasters, renewable energies, consulting and Biotech start-up coaching. Through his experience he gained an expertise in, business development, marketing & sales and business model design. Jean-Michel’s main role is to guide the overall management of the company.
Ilaria Chicca, PhD, is a researcher in biotechnology applied to environmental recovery of polluted matrices (University of Pisa). With a background in agritechnology, she then conducted research in environmental microbiology applied to the recovery of different contaminated matrices, such as soil, sediments, and wastewaters, via diverse mycoremediation approaches. As an expert in bacterial and fungal biodegradative processes on contaminated matrices, Dr Ilaria Chicca is leading the development of soil & sediments mycoremediation solutions.
Marija Stojiljković, PhD, is a biotechnologist specialized in the field of microbiology (KULeuven). The incredible kingdom of Fungi is her great passion and she is dedicated to exploring their endless beneficial impact on humans, ecosystems and environment. She mastered the yeast world on the aspect of beer, sourdough and bioethanol production and she has a keen interest in exploring the immense role fungi have on the environment, climate change prevention and sustainability through mycoremediation of the polluted natural resources. As a fungal fermentation expert, Dr. Marija Stojiljkovic is leading NOVOBIOM’s strain improvement program.
Since his childhood Maxime has been inspired by the beauty of nature and the resources it provides to meet the many challenges we face. With a master’s degree in molecular biology and an additional master's degree in entrepreneurship (UCLouvain), he likes to work in all biotechnology related fields and tackle different challenges every day. With his background in industrial biotechnology, he supports the team with his technical expertise throughout projects and is in charge of setting up Novobiom’s laboratory installations.
