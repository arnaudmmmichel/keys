Quares stands for Quality Real Estate Services (quality, innovation and sustainability). The buildings in this use case were majorly student accommodation, which are generally types of buildings that are very prone to leakages due to the lack of reporting by occupants. Shayp's technology aligns well with the vision of Quares.
Quares received multiple minor leak alerts in the past from Shayp, but after a major leakage of 1000 litres/hour appeared, Shayp's customer success manager was quick to contact them and guide operators in the following process : 
1) visual inspection of the building by the maintenance team
2) limited search by zones to eliminate step by step the areas without leaks
3) retrieve the help of a specialised leak hunting partner if the leak were still not found 
Quares started with the first step and the leakage was found fast. It appeared to be running toilets of almost 1000 L/h.
Cohabs is a Belgian company that offers fully equipped shared accommodation for young workers. Cohabs has an extensive network of shared houses, in which community and sustainability aspects are a priority. The famous Belgian architect Lionel Jadot has decorated the houses with care, reusing as many materials as possible for their transformation.
Cohabs is committed to continuing its efforts to reduce its environmental impact: achieving carbon neutrality is one of its key objectives. The team has therefore decided to reduce their use of resources, such as water: installation of sustainable rainwater harvesting equipment, solar panels, and smart energy monitoring tools such as June and Shayp.
Currently, 47 buildings have been equipped with Shayp's technology. No less than 200 leaks have been detected since 2020. So far, almost 4000 m³ of water has been saved, which is equivalent to almost 600 kg of CO2 emissions avoided.
Since the installation of Shayp's technology in 2020, nearly 200 leaks have been detected and avoided. The largest water leaks were fixed within the first year and Cohabs is now dealing with occasional anomalies such as dripping taps or blocked toilets. On average, the plumbing teams intervene within 30 days. As these are housing units, it's sometimes challenging for the maintenance team to act immediately but since Shayp presents the severity and urgency of the leakage, Cohabs can prioritise interventions cost-effectively and without disturbing occupants.
Getaway offers spacious flats to travellers in Belgium and elsewhere. 
Given the high rental rate of these flats, it quickly became apparent for Getaway that a combination of technology and comfort would be of great benefit to visitors. This is why automatic surveillance on plumbing systems 24/7 was met with high priority, thus avoiding problems with abnormal water usage, Furthermore, Getaway experienced a rapid return on investment in their multi-residential building since Shayp revealed existing leakages within 24 hours.
After the first installations of Shayp, they were quick to react and already resolved 77 leaks.
A leak of 700L/h suddenly appeared in one of Getaway's managed properties. Although an alert was sent to the property manager, the customer success team of Shayp pro-actively reached out to the contact person as a backup. They immediately informed the maintenance team of the building and were thankful for the guidance by Shayp in finding the source of the leak which turned out to be a toilet. Maintenance was able to fix it on the spot. After a feedback call, the property manager said she was happy to act fast, many kilometres away, without having to set foot in the building themselves.

ION is a real estate developer with the ambition to create high-quality living spaces with a focus on innovation. They are the first CO2 neutral property developer in Belgium. 
ION specialises in complex mixed-use projects, public-private partnerships and speculative developments. Shayp equipped their BREEAM-certified office building and after proving the efficacy of the system, Shayp has been their official partner for all their newly built buildings. At first, they were not expecting to find leakages within their premium-built and BREEAM-certified offices. However, with the help of Shayp, they managed to avoid over 170 kg equivalent carbon emissions over 1 year and this is only the beginning. 
“Directly after the installation of the Shayp device we found a leak. On [the] moment we could see that the Shayp’s system worked (...) otherwise it would have taken a few days or even weeks to detect the leak.” Maintenance manager
An automated alert was sent on a Friday so they decided to keep an eye on how the leak evolved over the weekend. By Saturday the leak had increased up to 8000 litres per day triggering an intervention. The culprit turned out to be an automatic tap with an anomalous sensor which left the water running consistently. Their Customer Success Manager contacted them when it was resolved and ION shared their story. ION was very happy with the technology and service, helping them save both water and money.
The ING Group is a Dutch-based multinational corporation that provides banking and financial services. ING has a broad range of buildings spread out across Benelux with each building assigned to a property manager and maintenance team. Both property managers and field technicians have direct access to intuitive Shayp WebApp. An easy collaboration has made addressing consumption anomalies highly effective. If they need to take action, Shayp will notify when needed. ING hadn't anticipated the importance of an effective leak detection system which had quickly provided the company with measurable water efficiency results and savings. 
ING went live in 2022 and has already saved over 3 million litres per year due to 35 reported leakages. In a couple of months, they were able to avoid 473 kg of carbon emissions by just monitoring their water and taking action efficiently.
A leakage in a faulty boiler had been detected within 24 hours after going live with Shayp. After further assistance with a Customer Success Manager, a few hours later they were able to localize the leak and prescribe a fix. A few days later, the components for the repair of the boiler arrived and the leakage was resolved. Consequently, their water consumption dropped by 51% even if a smaller leakage elsewhere in the building continued to persist.

and lower your water bills without increasing maintenance costs.
The City of Brussels is responsible for over 300 buildings that include historical buildings, offices, sports facilities, stadiums, swimming pools, public fountains, warehouses, schools, kindergartens, etc. It had been proven incredibly challenging for their plumbers to be able to manually check the many kilometres of plumbing systems and verify the hundreds of sanitaries spread across the whole city. Their energy management team sees water efficiency just as important as energy reduction targets and has seen a drop of their water usage by 30% compared to previous years.
Shayp autonomously reveals discrepancies and informs their operators which buildings require the highest degree of attention. Since then,they have gained a real-time overview of the leakages in their buildings across the Belgian capital and Shayp has helped them save millions of litres of water.
"Shayp has allowed us to identify and solve a critical problem that we did not know before. Startups such as Shayp are a necessity to address the issues of our future. The city of Brussels is proud to collaborate and support Shayp. Shayp has demonstrated a fairly spectacular return on investment. Whereas, when compared to conventional energy investments, returns are only initiated after several years."
Technical manager responsible for the rational use of resources
After receiving several leak detection alerts in this school, the City of Brussels undertook research to find the cause, unfortunately without success. They requested Shayp's Leaklink service : a specialised leak hunter partner was dispatched and was able to find that the leak was coming from several places :
- 2 toilets were constantly running
- 4 water taps were dripping
- 1 faulty regeneration system kept running continuously
The city of Dendermonde has approximately 80 buildings under management.
Delighted with the performance of Shayp's technology following a pilot, Shayp aligned well with the city's strong commitment towards sustainability and the preservation of water resources. The maintenance teams, in consultation with political representatives, decided to deploy the solution further.
Shayp detected 31 leakages in their pilot project which equated to saving over 1 million litres of water per year across only 5 buildings. They immediately wanted to scale the project after a measurable impact within only a few buildings. Stay tuned for the impact of their whole portfolio. 
Water leakages were detected on 2 separate heating systems which meant that hot water was being wasted. Hot water is approximately double the costs of cold water which made the sense of urgency even greater. After receiving the alert, the city's maintenance team localised the issue and ordered new parts for the boilers. The leak was instantly resolved as seen on Shayp's webapp and the maintenance team was delighted.

Do you wish to increase water efficiency and lower water bills without increasing maintenance costs in schools, universities...? Check out our 
 and how can it help you.
Universities are generally highly subject to leakages. ULB is a large Belgian university for international students and researchers based in Brussels. The institution is highly sensitive to the environment and has been working to reduce its environmental footprint for the past 16 years, whether in the field of energy, food, transportation or water. With this in mind, the ULB approached Shayp to acquire its technology. Currently, the technology covers 3 campuses: Solbosch, La Plaine and Erasme.
Schools and universities are highly prone to leaks, especially due to unchecked sanitaries, higher vacancy rates and older plumbing systems. Given the heavy use of toilets in this type of building, water loss can average 30%. In this specific case, a leak of 400 litres per hour was detected caused by an unreported blocked toilet flush. Maintenance teams were quick to react after an alert was sent to them.
GBZ de Bosrank is a municipal primary school of Kruisem. Together with the children, the entire school strives for a sustainable and environmentally friendly future by making conscious choices.
Of all buildings, schools are the most subject to leakages due to higher vacancy rates, restricted resources for maintenance and generally older plumbing systems.
On average, we see a 55% loss of water due to leaky toilets, forgotten taps on weekends and HVAC anomalies.
Heavy continuous water consumption was detected in the school averaging 200 litres per hour on a Friday afternoon. The cause was revealed the following day: a rainwater pump was leaking that would have gone unnoticed for months. The technical team found the culprit and was able to prioritise its repair.
The University of Avignon is an old French university with many academic buildings. This university offers a large number of courses, particularly in the environmental sector as well as in geology and water sciences. The university decided to use the Shayp technology to better monitor water leaks and avoid any bad surprises on their water bill. Thanks to Shayp the university recently embarked on a mission to eradicate toilet leaks and successfully resolved most of them. 
The University of Avignon was notified due to abnormally high consumption and was able to see the leaks on the WebApp. The building operator decided to intervene in order to reduce the volume of the leakage by taking several measures: 
The valves of leaky toilets were temporarily shut off and were later upgraded with more robust flushing systems.
The Vrije Universiteit Brussel is one of the bigger universities in Belgium, home for people all over the world. 
Research shows that schools are prone to leakages because of low occupancy rates along with elaborate and older plumbing systems. The VUB has a very hands-on sustainability team that uses smart technology to monitor their buildings and fight water waste pro-actively. They want to make a difference and be an example for students in terms of sustainability. When building new campuses, the VUB now always includes Shayp technology. Even in their new buildings, they were able to detect and fix leakages fast. 
Litres saved since using Shayp: 62.700.000
Euros saved since using Shayp: 86.000
Leaks detected since using Shayp: 415
Every morning the VUB cleaning staff makes sure students are in well-maintained buildings. On this particular Friday, Shayp's AI noticed that the water consumption of the building kept increasing after cleaning hours. An automated alert was sent to the VUB after a few hours of abnormal water consumption. The property manager was notified of a leak of 80 L/h on a Friday. Their plumbers found an anomalous tap on Monday and fixed it by Tuesday. 
Scholengroep Impact belongs to the GO! group of schools in the Torhout-Bruges-Knokke region. 
Our data shows that schools are highly prone to leakages due to low occupancy rates along with lengthy and older plumbing systems. Scholengroep Impact wanted to address leakages via an easy-to-install water monitoring system that incorporated a robust and intuitive leak detection system. In 2021, the sustainability team and field technicians saved approx 30.000.000 litres over all monitored schools. Because of this, they avoided 4070 kg of CO2 and saved 28.000 euros per year.
During the weekend, a hidden leaky toilet caused a continuous flow of 800L/h. This anomaly caused a leak percentage of 60% of the total water consumption. After getting an automated alert from Shayp, the school fixed it on Monday and saved a lot of water.

Sint-Pieters-Leeuw is a Belgian municipality that manages multiple healthcare centres. From past experiences, they learned that the more appliances, sanitaries and water systems a building has, the more likely a problem will occur. Indeed, a leak can happen very fast in healthcare centres and can go unnoticed for months. Shayp's smart technology is capable of making the difference between normal water usage and anomalies with little to no false positives. The leak detection system has helped Sint-Pieters-Leeuw better prioritise repairs cost-effectively thanks to Shayp's classification system. They've saved 20% on their water bill in 2022, representing over 3.5 million litres of water per year.
Sint-Pieters-Leeuw got a leak alert for their retirement home over the weekend. It was a big leak accounting for several hundred litres per hour. Maintenance teams discovered that 2 boilers were malfunctioning. They were quick to replace 1 of the leaky boilers but had to wait for the replacement parts for the second boiler. Water loss was 100% mitigated thanks to Shayp and their repair efforts.
Zorgbedrijf Meetjesland is composed of residential care centres and home care services.
Because of their large and spread-out building portfolio they started using Shayp to monitor water consumption remotely and retrieve water meter indexes digitally. They not only discovered they were saving time and effort, but that Shayp's water efficiency analytics helped save a considerable amount of water.
In early 2022, they already saved 3.5 million litres per year of water equating to 17600 euros saved per year and 526 kg of carbon emissions avoided.
After a few weeks of working with Shayp, an alert was notified that water consumption tripled in volume. After a research operation, they found out it was a faulty water softener. Water softeners tend to be highly prone to water leakages and anomalous water discharges.

This is your normal weekday water consumption
For the past 3 years, Shayp has been continuously refining its leak detection algorithm that identifies discrepancies as rapidly and reliably as possible. Our algorithm progressively learns the normal flow patterns in plumbing systems, no matter their size, and assesses leakage patterns that differ from the human or normal water consumption. Our algorithm continues to improve, and all our clients and partners benefits from the latest updates of Shayp’s leak algorithm.
This is your normal weekday water consumption
We are currently pushing the boundaries of water analysis by determining the most likely type of leakage, based on data collected in the field. Our algorithm can almost link household consumption to different activities and appliances. Soon, homeowners will be able to benefit from new information about their water consumption, allowing them to manage it even better.

At Cohabs, we aim to limit the use of resources as much as possible in order to reduce our impact on the environment. In our homes, we tend to use durable devices and tracking devices to educate our members about their energy use. Thanks to Shayp, we can also detect water leaks in real time. Installing the device is very easy, and we have personalized support from the team who continues to make constant improvements to the system. For these reasons, Shayp is a key partner for us.
Aware that water leaks can be very expensive and in order to have a better view of our water consumption, we recently equipped our 3 hospitals and 4 polyclinics with Shayp technology. This monitoring allows us to be informed quickly in the event of detection of any abnormal flow. The advantages of this type of service for a hospital center such as EpiCURA are therefore numerous: daily global monitoring, faster interventions on faulty installations, savings in water and money.
The care and maintenance of the 5 Iris Sud hospitals represent a daily challenge for our teams. Shayp gives us the opportunity to monitor our water consumption from hour to hour and have peace of mind. Their technology detects any inconsistency and alerts us immediately when a water leak occurs in one of our buildings. We can now save water and money as well as prevent any risk when it comes to the integrity of our plumbing.
The partnership set up with Shayp allows us to monitor our water consumption at the "Central Building" of the University of Liège which is supplied by five water meters.This monitoring allows us to be alerted in the event of a water leak or abnormally high consumption in order to reduce our consumption and avoid damage to our infrastructure.What particularly appeals to us about Shayp is that their technology allows for reduced maintenance, a granularity of data less than a quarter of an hour and that an API is available to integrate the measurements on our tracking platform.

How does Shayp alert me of a leak?
Once you have access to your Shayp account, you can decide how you wish to be notified of a leak: whether it be by sending you a text message, an email, or by sending an alert to a specific URL - and this way integrating your alerts to a platform that you may already use. This will improve your 
 detect the minimum water flows during unoccupied times of the building, even buildings with night activity. Shayp reliably detects leaks using “machine learning” and statistical methods that adapt to the consumption pattern of the building. If you wish to learn more about our algorithm, check this page.
How fast can Shayp detect leaks?
Leaks over 4 liters per hour (a trickle) can be detected within an hour, small ones require more time, but the detection of both of them will improve your 
. In big buildings, leaks are detected within a couple of hours. The detection will be accurate from 24h after the installation.
What are the smallest leaks Shayp can detect?
It depends on the precision of your water meter. We can detect leaks as small as 50-60 mL per min.
What do I have to do if I spot a leak that Shayp do not detect?
If that ever happens, please send us an email to this address: support@shayp.com. Do note that Shayp cannot detect leakages that are not from the water supply piping system.
