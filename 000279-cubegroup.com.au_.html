A purpose-driven consultancy, with a strong vision for a better future, Cube Group is a consultancy at the centre of positive change.
We’re a highly skilled firm with capabilities including strategic planning, policy development, organisation design and performance, commercial and financial advice, project management, stakeholder and community engagement, and program evaluation.
Our team brings curiosity, generosity and practicality to projects. With a true spirit of partnership, we stand side by side with clients, listening intently, sharing experiences, leveraging connections and solving problems together.
Our work takes us into many public value settings, including health and human services, environment and land use, justice and crime prevention, emergency management, education and learning, transport, infrastructure, and economic development.
Together, we’re creating a bright future for every Australian.
Cube works exclusively with purpose-driven organisations who share our commitment to creating public value in all aspects of their business.
Our clients include federal and state government departments and public entities, local government, community service organisations, not-for-profits, peak bodies and other member-based organisations.
Our decision not to work with organisations who deliver only shareholder value is central to who we are, and what makes us different. Our energies, talents and insights are entirely immersed in helping our clients make a positive difference for the communities and industries they serve.
Cube is a Certified B Corporation (B Corp), and part of a global movement of companies that are using their business as a force for good. As a B Corp, we hold ourselves to high standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability.
The firm has also been named one of the Australian Financial Review Boss Magazine’s Best Places to Work 2022, ranking #5 in the professional services category from over 750 nominated organisations across Australia and New Zealand.
Our firm is impressive for many reasons, but the most critical one is our people. Cube Group is made up of smart, hard-working and down-to-earth people who care about public value and act with integrity.
Our people share common values, love working together and are proud to be part of an organisation that is enhancing quality of life in Australia.
Our founder Ben Schramm created Cube Group after recognising a crucial need for a values-based management consultancy. A consultancy that would work exclusively with purpose driven organisations to deliver positive change.
In 2002 Cube started as a small group of former big 5 consultants and public sector executives with a shared vision for public value. We quickly began working in partnership with our clients to solve complex problems.
Delivering several landmark projects in emergency management, justice and human services, Cube quickly expanded its reputation, relationships and capability to address complex and contemporary public value challenges.
Today, our talented team provides multi-disciplinary management consulting services to a range of public value organisations in diverse sectors of our economy, across Australia.
Cube proudly remains Australian owned and operated.

Business as a force for good
We’re proud to be a Certified B Corporation, part of a global movement of people using business as a force for good. As a B Corp, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of social and environmental performance, ethical practice, transparency and legal accountability.
We became a B Corp because our reason for being – making a difference in the community – aligns perfectly with the values and goals of the B Corp movement. Our Certification as a B Corp is like an accountability partnership – we make a genuine commitment to positive social impact, and our B Corp certification serves as a constant reminder that promises made are promises kept.
Being a B Corp is part of our DNA and guides the way we make decisions in all aspects of our business, and at all stages of our value chain.
B Corporations are about using business as a force for good, which squares with our commitment to positive change.
We want to help our clients deliver public value for communities, industries and our planet, and being a B Corp is a great fit for our purpose-led mission and culture.
We have a team that are very purpose-led and strongly committed to using their talent and energy for good – they love Cube being part of the B Corporation movement as a reflection of that commitment.
Being a B Corporation helps us achieve our goals by strengthening our culture, crystalising our decision making and signalling to our market what we stand for. As a result we’re able to bring the right people to the table to deliver positive change and achieve our vision for a better future.
Bringing a B Corp mindset to the table means we interrogate our choices through the lens of social impact. Better choices, better social outcomes. We have implemented progressive practices to support our people through flexible work practices, gender neutral and subsidised parental leave, access to development opportunities and we demonstrate our commitment to wellbeing through providing additional leave.
We are committed to supporting Australian businesses and social enterprises. With a commitment to supporting ethical and sustainable products from local suppliers, much consideration goes into selecting the products that fill our cupboards.
Recognising that our business activities have an impact on the environment, including in the areas of waste, energy, water, raw materials and carbon dioxide emissions, we commit to environmental sustainability in our workplace and consider the environment in all relevant business decisions, use 100% green energy, support progressive compost and waste management initiatives.
Our Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP)
At the heart of everything we do is our vision for a better future. Endorsed by Reconciliation Australia – we are proud to present our first Reconciliation Action Plan, which helps us to realise our vision by committing Cube to meaningful actions and advancing reconciliation in our own unique way.  Our “Reflect RAP” is designed to prepare us for future RAPs and reconciliation initiatives. It’s the starting point in our reconciliation journey – forming the basis for the next level of RAP (Innovate).
Our RAP is designed around Reconciliation Australia’s framework of 
 for implementing reconciliation initiatives. While a Reflect RAP doesn’t necessarily require us to make changes to policies, we are required to scope and reflect on how Cube, as an organisation, can contribute to reconciliation. Over the coming months we’ll be working on the actions detailed in our plan and measuring our impact. We’ll continue to engage Indigenous suppliers, seek and share knowledge, educate ourselves and identify opportunities to forge respect and strengthen our relationships with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
