Moorup (meaning: “Life” in the Woi Wurrung language of Australia’s First Nations people).
We are an Australian technology company, whose mission is to extend the lives of electronic devices, helping bring Connectivity to Unconnected Consumers. Since our formation in 2018 we have focused on offering recommerce solutions to help make the mobile industry sustainable. Our team of telecommunication experts utilise their networks to buyback, renew, recycle, donate and sell devices through various corporate, retail and wholesale channels locally and globally.
We understand how hard it is finding a partner who’s easy to work with. We’ve been there. We get it. Most vendors require heady-duty integrations which take months of gruelling work just to get started, and only offer partial solutions. Moorup provides recommerce solutions at speed, meaning WE do the hard work, and YOU can start looking at profitability within weeks.

Smartphones are useful. They connect billions of people around the world and help to improve lives through access to information. But we can’t go purchasing new smartphones every year. It’s bad for our pockets and terrible for the environment.
A circular economy extends the life of the smartphones, through reuse, repair, refurbishment and recycling.  Bringing these principles to your business significantly reduces the environmental impact of your smartphones which is not only the right thing to do, but has significant sustainability and business benefits.
Moorup has the ambition to enable that all smartphones in the world will be reused or recycled. The significant emission footprint left behind from the mobile manufacturing industry and the environmental challenges created due to an underdeveloped reuse and recycling ecosystem. Requires us as consumers to think how we can contribute to the industry’s contribution in delivering on 
. These goals are the blueprint to achieving a better and more sustainable future for all.
Our mission is to extend the lives of electronic devices, helping bring connectivity to unconnected consumers. We donate some of our refurbished devices to various charity groups. Like women in remote towns who are at risk of family violence without access to mobile phones to seek emergency assistance. Or those people in need, who are domestic violence victims or elderly, providing the means to connect with family, friends and essential services.
 to ensure devices we are unable to re-use are responsibly recycled to the R2 Responsible Recycling Standard. Disassembly is completed by local Australian resources with 99% of the materials recovered and recycled.
 to ensure refurbished devices we sell overseas are not contributing to the global e-waste problem. We take one phone out of Africa or Asia for every device we sell through our international wholesale channels. This phone will be responsibly collected and recycled.
Changing the mobile industry one device at a time
