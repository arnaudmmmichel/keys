When training is well-designed and delivered, it can be a powerful tool for improving employee skills and knowledge and growing your business. It can also help   to boost morale, productivity, and customer satisfaction. However, if training is not engaging or relevant, it can quickly become boring and ineffective.
At Red Wagon Workplace Solutions, we create and deliver training programs that are aligned to legislative requirements whilst being relevant to your industry and team so that they can enjoy the knowledge sharing process.
Our wide range of training programs include:
– how do we engage with our employees before day 1 and throughout their onboarding
– protect your team through understanding all aspects including psychosocial and physical, how to prevent and what to do if harassment does occur
– guiding leaders on the process and how to make the performance review process a positive experience, setting up all for success
– what do the policies actually mean and how can they be successfully applied in the workplace by leaders and the team. We explore and expand on these questions whilst guiding your team to 
 – often great people are promoted because they are fantastic at their jobs, or they have shown dedication to your business – however, have we set them up for success without the investment of leadership skill development. Red Wagon Workplace Solutions can create a program that is aligned to your business requirements and desired outcomes
Complaints are always handled in a professional and confidential manner to protect your brand and to be legally compliant. We can manage individual complaints   in line with your existing grievance process, or create new processes where required. You will always receive formal documentation and evidence, followed by   robust recommendations for a solution which may include facilitated mediation.
Our mediation services can assist to resolve conflict between team members through a confidential process that allows both parties to share their   perspectives and to work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.
We offer external case management and investigation of whistleblower reports and other employee instigated or workplace related complaints.

Red Wagon Workplace Solutions offers specialist diagnostic and audit services, tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of your organisation and industry.
Our reviews are more than just a HR health check or a templated checklist – they involve a detailed analysis of your practices and processes, highlighting areas of risk and providing clear and practical actions for improvement. It is imperative that your organisation is meeting legislative compliance and governance standards, and that your processes support both your business and your employees.
As industrial relations and human resource experts, we are best placed to offer objective and knowledgeable audits for payroll functions, sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination, industrial relations functions and enterprise agreement compliance.
Discrete and professional end to end handling of corporate matters, which could damage or inhibit your brand and culture.
We’re highly experienced at handling delicate investigations – from fraud to theft, to harassment and bullying, we’ll adapt to your unique circumstances to consider the evidence and produce independent recommendations and deep dive reviews based on our findings.
Red Wagon will investigate the matter efficiently, thoroughly, and tactfully.  Our approach is fair and impartial; our advice is practical and straight-forward with recommendations taking into consideration the best possible outcomes for all parties and the organisation.

HR Support That Makes a Difference
So often we hit the ground running, but a time goes on, we realise that the busyness of work is all reactive.
The “people” issues in a workplace can be some of the most difficult, complex and sensitive challenges for managers to deal with in their business. Even when you have a good idea of how to tackle an issue, nothing can replace the value of talking it through with someone you can trust, someone who is impartial and can help you to understand your options and risks.
Whether you have an HR resource in-house, or it is one of the many hats you wear, Red Wagon will provide you with wise and practical HR advice. We have years of experience of guiding managers through the messiest, most complicated workplace issues, so you can feel confident that you are receiving reasoned and practical guidance from an experienced HR consultant who not just understands business, but understands your business.
Australia has the most complex workplace relations laws in the world. The 
 forms the foundation of all workplace and employee-related activities, from the hiring process to terms and conditions of employment, workplace changes, dispute resolution and employee exits. In such a complex environment, it is no wonder that you need a guide to help you unpack your human resource compliance activities!
Engaging a seasoned HR consultant to partner with your business is a practical and efficient option that will provide you with access to the best HR tactics and strategies that will make a positive difference to your employees, your business, and you.
Contact us for HR support that makes a difference
There are a number of factors to consider when selecting an external or outsourced HR service provider.
It is important for you to spend the time to find the ideal HR partner who can meet you where your business is at now, as well as support your growth and changing needs.  Red Wagon takes the time to understand your business and build relationships with your team to ensure you the best outcomes.
You should not have to be restricted to a certain number of support hours a month, or pay for tailored documentation only to receive generic templates and advice.
We have listened to CEOs and senior leaders and have designed a strong and flexible framework upon which we can build a HR solution unique to your business requirements.
HR membership plans designed for your business
With the field of human resources and people management becoming increasingly complex and bound by legislation, asking your Office Manager or Payroll person to take on HR duties attracts unnecessary risk to your business.
At Red Wagon Workplace Solutions, we work with businesses of all shapes and sizes from 5 to 300+ employees. Some have an individual responsible HR administration but no designated HR Manager. Others have an HR Advisor or HR Manager but understand that they need more support, coaching or specialist skills to get the best results for the organisation and reduce their risk. When your organisation crosses the official threshold of a small business and has more than 15 employees, you are considered by Fair Work to have the resources and ability to access accurate and sound HR advice.  It is important that you have access to that advice whenever you need it.
Human Resources is more than just recruitment (oh, and we don’t do recruitment) and training. Organisations need to have the input of strategic HR and IR specialists to drive business growth and effectively respond to challenges and risks. They also need to have practical and effective HR consulting at an operational level to achieve the best outcomes for employees and the business.
It can be difficult and costly to find one individual who has the breadth and depth of skills, knowledge and experience that will truly make a positive difference to the experience of employees and help drive business outcomes.

Workplace complaints are challenging to deal with – they can be complicated, emotional, and very unpleasant.  More often though, many employees simply stay silent when they witness wrongdoing in the workplace.
 that a leading cause of employee silence is a fear of repercussion.  Whether that is a perception that raising a complaint or making a report will jeopardise job security or career prospects, that the individual might suffer harassment or threat, or simple wilful blindness, it appears that the traditional methods of code of conduct training, speak up lines and culture surveys do little to encourage reporting, or to even illuminate the occurrence of misconduct. 
At Red Wagon, we recommend an integrated approach to complaints handling.
Reporting lines should be externally managed, accessible and have the ability to be anonymous if necessary.  The independence of an external reporting tool provides employees with greater confidence that they won’t be persecuted as the messenger, or pre-judged by a fellow employee documenting their concerns.
An integrity-based culture is vital for employees to feel as though they can have confidential conversations, admit mistakes, and be treated fairly.  If an employee feels unsupported, that bias is at play, or that management never takes action, toxic behaviours can grow unchecked and unremarked, resulting in a range of workplace problems.
3. Deliver meaningful training and communications
Ticking the compliance box of training is neither defensible nor acceptable practice for an organisation in the face of serious complaints.  Impactful training, transparent discussions and showing genuine appreciation for the courage of those who do report will go a long way to reducing bystander silence.
Contact us today to discuss implementing a complaints handling framework in your workplace
We triage the reports, so you don’t have to… 
The legislation that surrounds the many types of workplace complaints that can be raised is extensive and complex. Understanding what legislative provisions apply, and how that impacts the management of the complaint is crucial to effective complaint management.
 and negotiations, the consultants at Red Wagon has the knowledge and expertise to know what information is crucial to obtain when documenting a report to determine which frameworks must apply to meet compliance obligations, best support the parties involved and mitigate the risk to the organisation.
Mediation is a confidential, voluntary process with the purpose of assisting people to resolve workplace conflicts.  The process is managed by an independent mediator, which enables parties to have productive conversations, navigate issues, understand options, and explore solutions.  The discussion gives the participants an opportunity to be heard, and to hear what each other has to say. 
Not all workplace conflicts are suitable for mediation, and our experienced consultants will discuss with you your options for managing the conflict.

HR Investigations Adelaide | Red Wagon Workplace Solutions
 to learn more about Red Wagon

Disputes and misconduct can occur in any workplace. They can take the form of allegations of bullying, harassment, discrimination, fraud, or unethical behaviour, all of which have serious consequences for the people involved, and the organisation as a whole. Unaddressed, the issues can continue to escalate, resulting in greater anxiety and unrest in the workplace, further problems amongst employees and unnecessary costs to the employer.
Investigations are difficult processes for all parties, so if it is not the best method of responding to workplace complaints or behavioural concerns, other options should be considered. A preliminary review (also sometimes called a pre-investigation, or a preliminary assessment) occurs before a decision is made to proceed with a full workplace investigation. It involves the conduct of preliminary enquiries to collect more information about workplace complaints in order to assess whether the evidence will be of sufficient substance to warrant a formal investigation. It can ultimately save time, money and minimise risk to the organisation.
A preliminary review involves interviewing the complainant to better understand the issues of concern, the availability of witnesses and/or corroborating information and evidence, whether the allegations appear to represent a breach of a workplace policy or standard. It is also important to ascertain what resolution the complainant is seeking. This information enables the employer to assess whether another process such as mediation, training or coaching might better resolve the issue than a formal investigation process.
To protect the confidentiality of parties and the integrity of any potential future investigation, the respondent and witnesses would not normally be spoken to as part of the preliminary review. There may be situations in which there is benefit in collecting further data and statements from multiple parties to establish the nature of the dispute and the different perspectives, however, as a general principle, notifying people of potential allegations that may not eventuate and might not be confirmed is unhelpful.
Red Wagon will investigate the matter efficiently, thoroughly, and tactfully. Our approach is fair and impartial; our advice is practical and straight-forward with recommendations taking into consideration the best possible outcomes for all parties and the organisation.
Key elements of our approach are:
We will discuss the matter with you and review the written complaint if available. Understanding what actions have already been taken and why you believe an investigation is the best approach informs the scope of work, and will provide us the basis from which we can advise you of options for management and resolution of the issue other than a formal investigation is all part of our pre-investigation review.
Not all workplace issues require an investigation, and sometimes other strategies such as mediation will achieve a better result.
We will advise you as to whether we believe an investigation is appropriate and whether we believe the investigation should be conducted under legal professional privilege, and have significant experience working with Australian law firms to investigate complaints for their clients.
The preliminary review process involves a formal interview with the complainant to better understand their concerns, the available evidence to be considered, and potential witnesses to be interviewed.  The investigator will make an assessment of whether the allegations, if substantiated, may constitute a breach of a workplace policy or standard, and prepare a summary report documenting the recommendations.
Having an agreed scope of investigation (which allegations will be investigated) and a mutual understanding of the process, roles and framework is key to a smooth and efficient investigation process.
Our process will be tailored to your unique needs, but can include:
Preparing notification of investigation to relevant parties on your behalf, including a statement of allegations.
Conduct of interviews with relevant parties (complainant, respondent and witnesses).
Collect relevant evidence, which may include emails, file notes, internal documents and electronic evidence.
Ensure that parties are provided with the opportunity to review and comment on any evidence as required.
Analyse the available evidence and draw conclusions based on the standard of proof, the balance of probability.
Prepare an investigation report clearly setting out the allegations, our findings and any additional comments, observations and practical recommendations of the investigator. All evidence relied upon in drawing conclusions will be provided as part of the report.
5. The Support And Communication You Can Expect
We will provide support and coaching to you and your managers where needed throughout the process to ensure a consistent and unified approach to resolving the complaint.
We know that an investigation process is difficult and can be upsetting for everyone involved. We will make every effort to communicate clearly and regularly with the relevant parties so that they understand what involvement is required from them and when, their rights, the support available to them, and the progress of the investigation.
Supporting You to Achieve Better Outcomes
Getting the best outcome from an investigation process involves far more than ‘just’ having an experienced investigator complete the assessment for you. You need someone who takes the time to understand and apply your processes and policies, displays care and consideration for all the parties involved (and that includes you!) and will provide you with practical and useful insights into what is 
At Red Wagon, we understand people and we know business. A powerful combination when combined, we utilise these skills to complete our analysis and recommendations as to which facets to consider to make defensible decisions. Our expertise in workplace investigations and knowledge of employment law not only ensures a robust investigation process but also forms the solid foundation of our assessment and recommendation regarding potential breaches of workplace policy and state or federal laws.
Let us help you get to the bottom of your investigation.

When training is well-designed and delivered, it can be a powerful tool for improving employee skills and knowledge.  It can also help to boost morale, productivity, and customer satisfaction.  However, if training is not engaging or relevant, it can quickly become boring and ineffective which has been highlighted through results at the Fair Work Commission in negative consideration of the effectiveness of online training.
At Red Wagon, we create and deliver interactive, face to face training and individual coaching programs so that all can enjoy the knowledge sharing process.  
What first impression does your business bring?
The old saying ‘you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression’ is never truer than that of an employee’s first day.  However, we often forget that an employee’s ‘first impression’ with an organisation starts well before their first day on the job – it begins from their initial application.
During the Employee Experience training program you will be taken on a road of understanding of:
Understanding the core principles of an employee first culture and why it’s important
Recognising how to implement future state journeys within the framework of employee experience
How to define a vision for employee experience
Applying the employee experience vision to your future state
Articulating a set of objectives that can be applied to employee engagement across the entire business
Understanding the motivation for change and the implications for continuing with the status quo
How to create ownership adn buy-in to the employee experience across the whole of business
Building alignment between vision, objectives and employee journey mapping methodology to apply to designing future state employee journeys
Developing a model for prioritising future state activities
How to bring employee engagement campaigns to life: developing workflows and employee centric content
How to measure the effectiveness of employee journeys and other engagement activities
This program is suitable for all team members who are involved in recruitment, leaders and employee focussed decision makers across your organisation.
Protecting your team from physical and psychosocial harm.
The amended Work Health and Safety Regulations that came into effect on 1st April 2023, prescribe how duty holders must identify and manage hazards and risks to workers’ psychological health and safety.  These training programs delivered in a face to face, interactive format provide knowledge on how to protect your team, how to prevent sexual harassment and bullying from occuring, what to do if harassment does occur within a collaborative and supportive team environment.
Delivered face to face and aligned to your business and industry, these training programs will support employees to:
identify psychosocial hazards in the workplace
assess potential hazards and how to implement controls to reduce the opportunity for harassment or bullying to occur
understand the processes involved when investigating accusations of harassment and bullying in the workplace
understand the importance of protecting all parties during the investigation process
understand and appreciate the legal processes and decisions made in relation to harassment and bullying through the use of real world case studies
This program is one that all persons involved in your business should participate ensuring everyone is on the same page.
The importance of doing them well
We have all had the experience of a leader ‘
‘ once or twice a year because someone from HR put into place a Performance Review process, whilst they grumble under their breathe and throw you a feedback form to fill in.  What many forget, is the importance of the opportunity through these conversations to set up yourself and your team members for success.
We all like to feel appreciated, congratulated and know where the goal posts are so that we can celebrate when we have been successful in our roles; the Performance Conversation training program takes people leaders through an informed and interactive process to gain a full appreciation as to how, through the use of positive performance processes (not all conversations will be positive), and how when done well, they can result in a collaborative and forward moving team culture.  Bringing self awareness and reflective practices to the fore, this program will prepare your people leaders for effective conversations including the importance of:
Being prepared prior to and for the meetings with an understanding of the goals and objectives
Specific feedback and what that looks like
A focus on being constructive and helpful
The use of positivity within conversations where performance has not met expectations
Being open and how to receive 360 degree feedback for both the employee and leader
Focus on the opportunity to find solutions to perceived issues
Suitable and aligned for all leaders at various levels within an organisation.  A fresh perspective can always add value.
We have all seen the situation where  great people are promoted because they are fantastic at their jobs, or they have shown dedication to the business, however, have they been set up for success without the investment of leadership skill development?  Red Wagon offers both group leadership training or 1-1 coaching programs which are aligned to the requirements of both the individuals and your organisation.
We set your leaders up for success through the provision of:
A solid foundation in the core practices of leadership and styles for desired outcomes
Specific tools and strategies allowing them to track progress and make any required adjustments
An open and supportive forum to discuss challenges and solutions to set backs
Skill development in the areas of communication, influence, delegation, decision-making and conflict resolution
Understanding learning styles and training principles when upskilling/coaching team members
The Red Wagon Leadership training or Coaching programs are a valuable investment for your leaders and in turn your organisation.  Our Facilitators and Coaches are selected for their alignment in understanding your desired business outcomes and for the knowledge that they bring to engage and upskill your leaders.
We understand that within the world of business, having policies to outline requirements and expectations of our employees are essential to ensure that all are operating under the same expectations, however although in place, some policies are never fully understood by those who are required to follow and implement them.  Red Wagon can design a training program for your team and leaders to expand on the requirements and expectations of your policies and ‘
guide them to get it right

The bargaining table can be a lonely place. Many HR practitioners dread EA negotiations, and who can blame them? Managing the pressure from managers and organisations to “give nothing away”, the sometimes challenging exchanges with union representatives, and a handful of self-represented employees who expect to be taught the bargaining process during meetings – challenging does not begin to describe the experience of an HR professional! 
What many employers do not realise is that a successful EA process begins well before you even sit at the bargaining table. The level of your success is, in part, a result of effective strategic planning. This means doing some of the work upfront so that your management team are in the best position to achieve an efficient, productive and focused negotiation.
A good starting point is to look at the records you have from previous negotiations.
What were the goals of the organisation?
What was in the log of claims from representatives?
Were there sticking points, and how were they overcome?
Were there commitments made for the next round of bargaining?
Now, think about the organisational goals for this round of bargaining. 
What might the objections be and how can you handle them?
Do you have a communication strategy to keep employees accurately informed?
Is your EA compliant with the applicable legislation?
Are the clauses easy to understand and have clear intent, or is there room for improvement? 
Are there policies that need to be updated in line with the EA?
Good agreement planning comes from a balance of HR and operational strategy. You need to be big picture but detail-oriented, practical and resourceful, and be supported by excellent finance brains.
That isn’t all you need though.
Can you think of anything worse than finally finishing an EA negotiation, only to have Fair Work reject the Agreement because you did not follow the correct process?
It sends chills down the spine of every HR consultant.
The Fair Work Act imposes some strict requirements and time limits on employers at various stages of the bargaining process. Lack of knowledge of the technical aspects of the EA process, or of bargaining and negotiation more generally, can be your downfall and will make a difficult process even more unpleasant for you. If the Commissioner finds the EA non- compliant, the employer will be required to make undertakings for it to be approved. The truth is EA bargaining is complex, technical, and time consuming. You simply cannot learn it as you go and hope you can wing the process and terminology.
At Red Wagon, we have been there and done that for both employees and employers. We not only understand the commercial and HR strategy necessary for successful planning but have represented organisations and trade unions at the bargaining table and ensured their technical compliance.
You don’t have to shoulder the stress and risk that comes with flying solo. Contact the team at Red Wagon for a fresh perspective and practical support on how to get the best results.

Your beliefs drive your behaviour. You can have the most well-intentioned conscious thoughts and ideas, but if your subconscious isn’t on board, then your actions and the outcomes that you can achieve can be limited.
What does that have to do with enterprise agreement negotiation?
Let’s be honest, there is a negative stereotype of union officials and union representatives being intimidating, aggressive and hostile. Unsurprisingly then, when you are planning your EA strategy, your communications plan, and finally walk into a bargaining meeting, at the very least subconsciously, you are primed for a fight.
What often follows is a negative experience for the negotiating parties and the employees, the creation of an “us and them” culture between staff and management, and the erosion of trust. Bargaining becomes hostile, unproductive and takes far longer than it should.
At Red Wagon, we understand people and we know business. We also understand trade unions and employers because we have worked for and with both sides. Combined with expert knowledge of enterprise agreement negotiation and a balanced, objective perspective, the HR consultants at Red Wagon are perfectly placed to partner with your organisation through every step of the negotiation process.

Issues surrounding payroll compliance continue to be widely reported and are a priority for the Fair Work Ombudsman.  Payroll non-compliance includes instances of underpayment of wages, as well as failure to meet superannuation guarantee obligations and non-compliant record keeping.
Payroll is a challenging compliance area for businesses. The accuracy of payments is subject to correct application and interpretation of the relevant Modern Award or Enterprise Agreement, accurate timesheet records, and a range of other factors. Even small errors in data entry, when extrapolated over time, can add up to significant back payments.
A climate of fear and secrecy has developed around payroll non-compliance, with the media sensationalising cases.  In an ideal world, payroll systems would be perfect and there would be no human error.  Unfortunately, that is not reality.  Deliberate mispayment, “wage theft” is a different matter to an accidental underpayment.  The Fair Work Ombudsman will take this into account, as do the state laws that have been enacted regarding wage theft.
It is generally expected that businesses take proactive steps to regularly audit and review Position Descriptions against Awards / Enterprise Agreements and align to payroll data and processes to ensure compliance.  It is not enough to respond once you are aware there ‘might be’ an issue. This is no longer a responsibility that simply falls to payroll or finance more broadly, it is a shared responsibility between human resources and finance functions, with ultimate responsibility sitting with the Chief Executive Officer and Board Directors.
The best way to ensure compliance and achieve peace of mind is to have an external assessor conduct an audit. That audit should examine payroll and time and attendance records for all employees over several years as a minimum.  If the final report is unable to drill down to the level of the employee and shift, the audit is not thorough enough to properly uncover any errors.  Having looked historically and remediated any issues, it is important to implement a regular process of monitoring so that small checks are done frequently, and any issues are quickly identified.  How frequently the ongoing assessments are conducted will depend on the unique circumstances of your business, and they could range from quarterly to annually.
As experts in industrial relations, the team at Red Wagon is best placed to support you with compliance.  We will assist you to confirm the application of the correct industrial instrument and conduct a thorough classification review.  Working with payroll verification specialists and leveraging their configurable automated system, speed and accuracy will be on your side to enable rapid action and response to the identified root causes of any variance.
You can trust the Red Wagon Workplace Solutions team to provide straight-talking, practical advice that will make a difference to you, your employees, and your organisation.
