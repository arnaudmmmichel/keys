A 30 year international career in the ad agency world gave me the opportunity to work with many of the world’s best brands. Yet having been brought up with a strong social conscience, my career was at odds with my values. When I first discovered cause marketing and then Social Purpose, I realised I didn’t need to live with a foot in two worlds. I wrote my first book, “Path To Purpose”, Australia’s first book on cause marketing and social purpose and pivoted from my agency into a consultancy specialising in social purpose strategies.
Today, helping businesses do well by doing good is my niche. I have a deep understanding of what works and what doesn’t. And I work with like-minded partners who are also experts in their field. My vision for the future is simple: brands drive profit through purpose; business and marketing become a force for good. We’re on a mission to make Social Purpose a vital part of business.
This approach to business connects with people in such a powerful way. The leaders I work with feel the same way I do. They want more. They want business success but they also want it to be meaningful. They sense the opportunity for their business to do more for their people and their communities - and they’re grasping it. 
Today business offers extraordinary opportunities. Those leading with an authentic social purpose are thriving. If this resonates with you, come and join us. The time is now and our best is yet to come.

felix is a new mobile phone plan brand within the TPG Telecom Group. It launched in November 2020, becoming the first purpose-led brand in the group’s portfolio.
We were determined from the start that felix’s Purpose was going to be both meaningful and authentic, so we brought in The Cause Effect to support us in developing the Purpose strategy for Felix.
Carolyn ran two full-day workshops with us. The first workshop focused on building our Brand Purpose Blueprint, putting purpose at the heart of the felix brand; and defining the core aspects of our brand including our Vision, Mission, Promise and Social Purpose; our core target audience and brand archetype; our brand story and compelling value proposition; and our Purpose Impact Framework.
Through the second workshop we explored how we could embed our purpose in the business to drive action and impact.
Through these sessions and the work Carolyn did in between, we were able to get clarity on what a “Purposeful” felix brand looked and behaved like. It set us on a meaningful path to purpose which we continue to walk every day.
Carolyn also provided on-going support for our journey as we worked with a brand agency to further develop our brand strategy and our marketing and communications. This support was invaluable in keeping us focused and ensuring we didn’t lose sight of our higher purpose.
Paul Tierney, General Manager Business Development TPG Telecom
'Carolyn brought the very best out of each and every one of us.'
'The future is looking really, really positive and that's thanks to Carolyn and her level of investment in us as an organization.'
'What I really liked about working with Carolyn was her insights and frameworks that help anyone within any industry to come out with a really clear purpose'
'What I'm still blown away with is how, after many years of me struggling with our vision, our purpose, in a three hour workshop we pretty much managed to nail it.'
'It was an absolute delight to have her work with us to formulate something that will guide us for the next 10 years or more to come.'
'The work that we did with Carolyn Butler-Madden has been even more crucial to us now and we were blown away with how good it was'
'Carolyn did an amazing workshop with us where by the end of the day we were able to clearly able to articulate our purpose, mission, vision and values'
Carolyn has been an exceptional partner, collaborator and advisor to our and the agency team throughout the campaign development process and beyond.
The expert  guidance and  support of “The Cause Effect” and specifically Carolyn Butler-Madden has been fundamental in bringing our over 10 year ongoing active partnership with the Sister2sister charity (a mentoring program for at risk teenage girls) to the next level via a multi media fundraising campaign. 
This included valuable advice on strategy and development of a social purpose statement as well as donation activation (creative / website / promotion) and leverage opportunities via partners. 
Carolyn has been an exceptional partner, collaborator and advisor to our and the agency team throughout the campaign development process and beyond. With Cause Marketing being such a specialised, complex territory her guidance and ideas have been invaluable. 
I would highly recommend Carolyn and The Cause Effect to anyone seeking help and inspiration to create a Social Purpose and Impact strategy for their business. 
Having been recently inspired to implement a strategy to “Change Lives everyday just by doing what we do” I was faced with ‘ye olde’ dilemma – what a brilliant idea, but how can we embed this ideal into our company’s DNA? How do we engage and inspire our staff and clients to join us on the amazing path? The challenge we had was threefold; how do we align our social contributions strategically with our business and brand, how can we leverage and engage our staff and customers to connect with - and support - our purpose, and finally how can we scale our social commitment into the future?
Having known Carolyn was passionately committed to helping businesses uncover and create their own unique social purpose, I sought her advice on to how we could approach these challenges.
As a consequence, Carolyn developed and led a half-day workshop with our leadership team to help us discover our Social Purpose sweet spot. The results of this workshop were then delivered to all our staff. Under her guidance, we not only achieved a strategy that meets all our objectives but also one that engages, inspires and excites our entire team. While this is just stage one in our implementation programme, we are thrilled with our progress and excited for the future. Without Carolyn’s help we would not have; a clear understanding of our social purpose, how we can impact the world in a positive way by doing what we do, or how to inspire others with our endeavours. I would highly recommend Carolyn and The Cause Effect to anyone seeking help and inspiration to create a Social Purpose and Impact strategy for their business. 
If you’re on a purpose journey in your organisation, I couldn't recommend The Cause Effect and the Path to Purpose program highly enough.
I have been fortunate to work closely with Carolyn from The Cause Effect these past 9 months on an important piece of work for Blooms The Chemist. 
We undertook the Path to Purpose program which resulted in us launching our first brand purpose statement, and more importantly – we’re now working hard to embed our purpose throughout the organisation, and become a truly purposeful business. Carolyn inspires companies to do better by sharing examples of what great looks like. She presents highly relevant data to highlight how customers and employees are expecting more from companies, and that businesses who do good, do much better! 
Carolyn is engaging and deeply passionate about balancing purpose with profit. She helps companies think differently, see the new way forward, and avoid the pitfall of “business as usual.” On a personal note, I have found Carolyn to be an absolute inspiration and appreciate how she always challenges me to “think big.” I have thoroughly enjoyed working with her and believe I have become a better leader and person as a result. 
If you’re on a purpose journey in your organisation, I couldn't recommend The Cause Effect and the Path to Purpose program highly enough.
What was really amazing was that Carolyn was able to come up with a new vision, purpose and brand promise, social purpose statement and values which the Executive leadership team loved and was in line with our thinking
Everyone enjoyed the process and guidance from Carolyn.
We are very happy with the end result and from this were able to develop our marketing strategy and strategy to update our website and social media campaigns.
Carolyn was a delight to work with, very accommodating and passionate and extremely professional. She worked very quickly and turned this project around in a very short timeframe – for a good price and Carolyn even offered some free advice on the next steps!
Everyone in the Executive Leadership team enjoyed the process. And what’s more, when we held our roadshows with staff to launch our new vision, purpose and values the staff loved them and said they resonated with them. This means Carolyn got it right. We are now rolling these out across our company.
We always love working with Carolyn, in addition to just being delightful to work with, she has a knack for really broadening our ideas and then showing us how we can make then come to life!
We recently partnered with Carolyn (once again) to facilitate a session at our annual company conference focussing on evolving our Purpose and Impact to create more opportunities for meaningful work. 
It was a wonderful session and Carolyn really brought out the best of the group to create some really strategic and innovative ideas. 
We always love working with Carolyn, in addition to just being delightful to work with, she has a knack for really broadening our ideas and then showing us how we can make then come to life!
After one month of working with Carolyn it has all clicked together and I am energised from a business and personal perspective.
If you want to connect what lights you up personally with a profitable consumer driven business strategy understand Brand Purpose. Our business plan and positioning felt stale, unconvincing and tired. After one month of working with Carolyn it has all clicked together and I am energised from a business and personal perspective. It is your license to operate in today´s market.
If you have the chance to work with Carolyn and her team – grab it. She is one in a million.
We now have a clear and inspiring vision for an inclusive, thriving and sustainable community.
With Carolyn’s help and her ability to guide us through a well-structured process, we collaborated on apurpose and promise we are proud of and we now have a solid foundation for our caregiving brand.Understanding our brand identity is a game-changer in terms of the work we do, the people we attract to work with us and the difference we make in our local community and in the world.Right from the start Carolyn listened to where we were and with the benefit of many years of experience and a strong focus on social purpose, she guided us to where we needed to be.We couldn’t be happier with where we have ended up. We know there is lots of work to do, but there is no better feeling that knowing you have gone through a rigorous process and landed on a purpose and promise that feels authentic and allows for future growth and development.The attention to detail and service we received from Carolyn was second-to-none. We just haven’t seen this kind of attention and genuine commitment to achieving a great result from larger agencies.If you have the chance to work with Carolyn and her team – grab it. She is one in a million.

Our unique 6-step methodology enables business leaders to build a purpose-led approach for their business with confidence.
This program can be run live, online or a combination of both.
Purpose-led brands enjoy high levels of trust. They don't rely on pricing or value offers to generate sales. And they attract and retain motivated employees who contribute to the success of the business. Some of the most successful purpose-led brands have taken a very specific path to purpose: an approach where action speaks louder than words. 
This is a social purpose brand strategy. By having a clear vision of the kind of world they want to contribute to and by understanding the role their brand plays in contributing to it - their 'why' - they create enormous value and energy around their brand. Through this approach, brands become the vehicles to invite their people, customers and partners to collaborate with them in acting with purpose. In so doing they capture people's hearts and minds and ultimately energise the brand and the business behind it. This is business as a force for good.
 builds a robust foundation for purposeful business, utilising our unique 6-step methodology to embed purpose into a business and brand; and ultimately driving profit through purpose.

How does purpose help you grow a profitable business that people love?
What exactly does it mean to be a purpose-led business?
What higher purpose should your business serve and how do you serve it in a meaningful way?
WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?
Purpose in business has become a common expectation, from employees, customers and investors. Yet many business leaders struggle to understand what it means for their business. 
For Love & Money offers clarity on the most recent evolution of organisational purpose. It equates the demand for purpose in business with social purpose. Business as a force for good. Sharing inspiration from businesses such as Intrepid Travel, Outland Denim, Patagonia, Unilever, PayPal and Future Super, this book makes a powerful connection between the two things that drive social purpose-led businesses (which are inextricably linked):
. Of people, planet and humanity. It’s the raw emotion behind purpose. 
Why are they interlinked? Because when purpose drives profit, it offers a business the ability to play a bigger game; to be ambitious in the change you seek to create over the long term. Meanwhile you build a meaningful business for everyone involved; you attract passionately invested employees, customers, partners, suppliers and investors; and you build trust, the currency of a valued business.
WHAT VALUE DOES THIS BOOK OFFER?
Written for leaders of medium and large organisations, this book offers the following clear outcomes:
Clarity on what it means today to be a business led by a higher purpose
Insight into the powerful movement behind business-as-a-force-for-good
Inspiration from successful social purpose-led businesses
A methodology on how to define and embed meaningful purpose into your business and brand
A clear ‘how-to’ approach to get you started on identifying and articulating your brand purpose
 combines inspiration, insight and practical resources to empower you to reimagine your business and the higher purpose that will drive its success through the volatility of the twenty-first century.

PART IV:  YOUR PATH TO PURPOSE
PART V:   YOUR BRAND PURPOSE BLUEPRINT
PART VI:  PEOPLE LIKE US ACT
The book is structured into six parts. The first half, parts one to three, are designed to make a compelling case for purpose in business and the role of love in driving that purpose. 
The second half is dedicated to helping you take action. This is the practical part of the book which features a methodology to unlock the full value of a meaningful purpose strategy. 
But it goes one step further, with
 a deep dive into the first pillar of that methodology around brand positioning. This is so that readers can take that all-important first step to understanding what their organisation’s higher purpose could look like, or at the very least, get clarity on what a practical approach looks like, to help them reach that point of understanding.
Steve Jobs once said: “The storyteller is the most powerful person in the world. The storyteller sets the vision, the values and the agenda for an entire generation yet to come.”
That’s precisely what Carolyn does in this very different book. Not just for you, but those who follow you (in every sense of that word).
As you read, you’ll ask yourself all sorts of questions too. Tina Turner singing “What’s love got to do with it” will play in your mind from the very first paragraph. And you’ll get the answer to that on every page of this exhilarating book.
More to the point though, as you read each page, you’ll be creating your own stories in your business (and in your life) that really do set the vision, the values and the agenda for an entire generation yet to come.
That generation, and this one right now, will love the result too — a result we so definitely need. 
We’re at Code Red Alert … not just for the climate, but for the way we do business. 
When you act on this book, your business AND our world will be a very different place — perhaps even a place for love.
And we need that result (and this great book) right now.
I’m totally inspired once again reading Carolyn’s second book!  
I’ll admit, I rarely read any business or self-help books. Very rarely. I’d like to, don’t get me wrong; I mean to… I just never sit still long enough or perhaps give myself permission to stop and immerse myself in a book… that is until I read Carolyn’s first book Path to Purpose! It was gifted to me at the right time and it was so easy to read and so spot on, aligning with my thoughts and values, that I read it back to back in 2 days. In fact, I loved it so much I read it twice! 
That led to a wonderful working relationship over the next eighteen months and I will be forever grateful for Carolyn’s support in setting us on the right track and helping us see what we struggled to see ourselves.  To be featured in this book is an absolute honour and a privilege and having read this second book “For Love & Money” prior to publishing, I am inspired once again to continue our journey doing good business, that makes a positive impact, with love.  
There is so much to learn from this book, so much inspiration, this book has the potential to change the world. Really, I mean that. The potential impact is mind blowing, but it has to start somewhere, by reading it and then gifting it to just one person, or to everyone you know and care about. Be ready… this book will move you!
Carolyn Butler-Madden’s new book, For Love and Money – How to Profit with Purpose and Grow a Business With Love, is a must read for executives of companies interested in pursuing a more just and sustainable world, at the same time as being very successful financially. Furthermore, the book provides clear guidelines on how to do it – The Path to Purpose. 
Carolyn mentions Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman in Chapter 10 of her book. Friedman economics postulation that executives’ sole role was that of maximising shareholder wealth, has been extraordinarily influential since the 1970s. It has never sat well with me. Terms, meant at the time to be complimentary, such as “greed is good” come to mind. It is quite contrary to the views of philosopher Adam Smith, often referred to as the father of capitalism, in the 18th century, who believed the market was a mechanism of morality and social support – a blue-print for a just society that concerns itself with its least well-off members, not just economic success.
To me, this is what Carolyn’s book is about - how to go about returning capitalism to this fundamental belief. She demonstrates this with very impressive case studies, whilst at the same time pointing out how excessive economic greed has led some once great companies down a dark road.
The structure of the book makes it easy for readers to understand how they may set out on this journey themselves. First “For Love” – love what you do – do what you love. Then “For Money” – capitalism is dead – long live capitalism. And then the answer, “For Love and Money” – the role of purpose, something we all need.
Carolyn demonstrates how a company can go about doing all this by describing the journey the company I am CEO of, Blooms The Chemist, as a case study. When I read this, I thought to myself, why didn’t I see the potential and rightness of this approach to running a company before? On reflection, I probably did think about it, but did not have a guide, such as this book, to help me lead this sort of paradigm shifting endeavour.
This business book is also a love story about how we can make our world better through business for good, that leaps from the page.
This book is needed in the world. Carolyn Butler-Madden shows us that purpose and profit can and should co-exist in a strategic, but also emotional and heartfelt way. Interwoven with examples of companies who are leading the way, this business book is also a love story about how we can make our world better through business for good, that leaps from the page.
It’s inspirational, educational and profoundly thought provoking and written in a way that I find so gentle and easy to absorb, whilst carrying such a big and profound message
This is a book that gives those people who have felt the need for a better approach and a new path to follow in their business a map. It inspires them to do better and be better, but it doesn’t try to achieve this with a big stick. Instead, Carolyn goes to great lengths to showcase the alternative path by showcasing those that are already on it. It’s inspirational, educational and profoundly thought provoking and written in a way that I find so gentle and easy to absorb, whilst carrying such a big and profound message
This book is needed in the world. Carolyn Butler-Madden shows us that purpose and profit can and should co-exist in a strategic, but also emotional and heartfelt way. Interwoven with examples of companies who are leading the way, this business book is also a love story about how we can make our world better through business for good, that leaps from the page.
An essential read for today’s business leaders and the discerning consumers of their products and services. 
For Love and Money is not just a roadmap for creating your own path to social purpose with practical advice and a blueprint for success, it is a frank and often vulnerable account of Carolyn’s own journey as just one thread in a tapestry of splendid accounts of some extraordinarily brave leaders who took their own business’ beyond profit to making a difference in the world. 
From accounts of Patagonia’s commitment to be in business to “save our home planet”, to Dave’s Killer Bread’s very human story of redemption and second chances, Carolyn has captured the essence of how business can make a difference to their people, their customers and the communities they support through purpose and love, while still making a profit.
An essential read for today’s business leaders and the discerning consumers of their products and services. 
For any leader wanting to do better but not knowing where to start, this is a must-read.

For Love & Money tackles an enormous and potentially overwhelming topic with clarity, practicality and (perhaps most importantly) without judgement.
For any leader wanting to do better but not knowing where to start, this is a must-read. Carolyn Butler-Madden guides you through the process of defining an organisation's social purpose using compelling stories, illustrative examples and practical tools. 
In your hands is the most comprehensive articulation of how businesses, big and small can be powered by love, and still make one hell of a profit! 
This book is a must for every CEO, executive and entrepreneur that wants to stay relevant in these dynamic times.  In your hands is the most comprehensive articulation of how businesses, big and small can be powered by love, and still make one hell of a profit! 
Filled with tangible examples of the who, how and what, For Love & Money provides both inspiration and a go to resource for anyone seeking to start their journey into more purposeful work. 
Carolyn asks us to consider if business has realised its true potential - and to suspend judgement as she suggests businesses could and should act with love. Could love be the answer to how we build a more just, equitable and sustainable world? 
As a firm and passionate believer that we are coming to a tipping point, where businesses who act with a higher purpose will reap the rewards, this book was music to my ears. Business can and must act with humanity, capitalism can be rebuilt to benefit us all. Can businesses really love? I'm not sure - but I'm certainly left thinking about whether they should.  
Filled with tangible examples of the who, how and what, For Love & Money provides both inspiration and a go to resource for anyone seeking to start their journey into more purposeful work.

Carolyn’s 30-year international marketing career includes 18 years as an agency owner, working with some of the world’s best brands. Since starting her Purpose Consultancy, The Cause Effect, in 2017, ‘Profit with Purpose’ has become her guiding mantra.
