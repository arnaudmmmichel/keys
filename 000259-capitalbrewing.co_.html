meta description:N/A

Capital Brewing Co-founders Managing Directors Tom Hertel and Laurence Kain Grew up in Canberra just one suburb apart. Their paths crossed for the first time in 2005 when they both started working in bars around Canberra. It was here that they bonded of a shared love of quality beverages and the hospitality trade.
In 2011, they pooled together the money they‚Äôd squirrelled away from working behind bars and with the help of some mates and some sledge hammers, turned an old Italian restaurant into Canberra‚Äôs first bar focused on independent Australian craft beer. Being pre-craft-beer boom, that beer wasn‚Äôt easy to come by. Every fortnight they‚Äôd drive a hire truck to Sydney and return laden with kegs, which were soon emptied, thanks to the voracious local appetite for quality brews.
CRAFT BEERS THAT EVERYONE CAN ENJOY NOT JUST BEER AFICIONADOS WITH HOP CRUMBS IN THEIR MOUSTACHES
It didn‚Äôt take long for the guys to realise they wanted to build a business that combined their passion for hospitality, quality beer and the place they call home. In 2012 they went to the USA to experience the burgeoning craft beer scene. Armed with valuable knowledge around brewing techniques and equipment, they returned home, sold everything they owned and with a little help from friends and family, scraped together the cash to open Capital Brewing Co. The vision from day one was to brew a range of craft beers that everyone can enjoy, not just beer aficionados with hop crumbs in their moustaches.
In September 2016 Capital Brewing Co launched!!!
Today, after a whole lot of yeast, hops and hard work, Capital Brewing Co is one of the largest independent craft breweries in Australia with a team of 70 plus and a whole lot of exciting things in the pipeline.
Capital Brewing is Australia‚Äôs first Climate Active certified 100% carbon neutral brewery!!! 
We‚Äôre also B-Corp Certified, joining a global network of 5,500 companies worldwide who are committed to building a better economic system. 
‚ÄòGood Natured‚Äô is the lens that we put across every beer we brew, and everything we do. We always use fresh, natural ingredients that we source locally wherever possible to minimise our impact on the environment. For more info on how seriously we take this responsibility 
And being located at the base of Brindabellas makes it easy to source some of the cleanest water on the planet to make our beer.
In a nutshell, being good natured means everything from treating our employees and the planet with care and respect, to giving back to the local community that has supported us, and not taking the last slice of pizza at Friday drinks.

Our Purpose ‚Äì Capital Brewing Co
Capital Brewing Co is proud to announce we have achieved B-Corp certification!
We join a global network of 5,500 companies worldwide who are committed to building a better economic system.
Read on to see how choosing Capital means you‚Äôre having a positive impact on our planet, our people and our community.
Australia's First 100% Carbon Neutral Brewery and Beers
We‚Äôre proud to be the first brewery in Australia to achieve Climate Active carbon neutral certification for our entire organisation and all of our products!¬†
Complete certification allows you to drink ice cold Good Natured Brews in the knowledge that you‚Äôre not contributing to global warming.
COMMITTED TO MAKING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT!
Sustainability is at the core of our ethos to make Good Natured Brews. We are continually looking at ways to reduce our impact on the environment. We track our resource use and have set reduction targets to ensure we‚Äôre making ice-cold beers you can enjoy with the knowledge you‚Äôre not warming the planet! 
Our pure mountain water is drawn primarily from the pristine Cotter catchment. Our current usage is already well below industry average thanks to numerous water-saving initiatives around the brewery including steam traps, a hot water ring main, and a centrifuge.
2020/21 Water Use - 4.1L H‚ÇÇO per/L of beer
2021/22 Water Use Target - 3.5L H‚ÇÇO per/L of beer
We‚Äôre installing an innovative automated cellar tank cleaning system to recycle rinse water and cleaning chemicals to further reduce our water use.
We aim to divert as much waste as possible from landfill to compost or recycling. In 2020/21 we diverted 709Tonnes of spent grain, hops and yeast to Landtasia Organic farm. We have eliminated more than 300 25kg plastic grain bags per week by installing a grain silo. We have worked with Brodburger to ensure food is served on compostable material.
2020/21 Waste Diverted from landfill - 78% (825,240L)
We‚Äôre constantly looking for ways to reduce our emissions, and those we cannot are 100% offset through the purchase of internationally verified carbon credits. In 2020/21 we emitted and offset 1,120 Tonnes of CO2.
2020/21 CO2 Emissions - 0.602 tCO2-e/1,000Litres of beer
2021/22 CO2 Emissions Target - 0.571 tCO2-e/1,000Litres of beer
Future strategies to reduce our GHG emissions include switching to more sustainably produced local specialty malts, lobbying freight providers to move to electric fleets, and sustainable staff commuting incentives.
We use 100% renewably sourced electricity at our brewery. We have numerous energy-saving initiatives throughout the brewery including heat exchangers, insulated glycol pipes and variable speed drive high-efficiency refrigeration motors.
‚ÄòTrees for Tomorrow‚Äô is our way of giving back. We plant trees with our mates 
 each winter. These trees draw down carbon from the atmosphere, rewild habitat for animals and beautify the natural environment. How do we do this? Every beer purchased at the snow directly contributes to trees in the ground.
We love having gigs and festivals at our taproom, but if you‚Äôre not careful they can result in a sh*t tonne of waste and rubbish. So we‚Äôve committed to having sustainable events through using re-usable glassware and bio-cups. We managed an 88% diversion from landfill at our last event (up from 67%) and we‚Äôre aiming for 100% in the near future.
What happens with our spent grain and yeast?
We send it up the road to our mates at Landtasia, watch the video to find out more.

There‚Äôs nothing quite as agreeable as drinking beer next to the tank it was brewed in.
Our Canberra Taproom is possibly the best place in the world to get together for a freshly poured beer. There‚Äôs a massive space for small humans to play in (including a cubby house and games) and shady spots for four legged family members to laze around and daydream about being able to drink beer. All up there‚Äôs 2000 metres of lush garden space, including the only beer river* in the world. And did we mention that we‚Äôve teamed up with the legendary team at Brodburger to bring you the finest burgers and hotdogs?
Every drop is bursting with hard graft, paired with passion, and rounded off with a full-bodied sense of local pride and unwavering committment to crisp, good times.
Food available from brodburger who have a permanent van in the taproom.
