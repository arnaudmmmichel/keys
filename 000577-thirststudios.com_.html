Providing women across Australia with a trusted world-class health service
Streamline nine websites, covering three audience groups into one user friendly destination.
Radical restructure of Information Architecture. Effortless content discovery with tags and filters. 
An engaged audience with massive increases in sessions, users and session times on site.
The organisation behind the hugely successful Womens Health Week - Jean Hailes for Women’s Health - is a national not-for-profit organisation that ‘translates’ academic, evidence-based research into positive practical health outcomes for Australian women
Jean Hailes approached us in mid 2013 with an interesting and ambitious objective; to merge over 1200 pages of health content, spread across 9 individual websites and aimed at 3 distinct audiences into one, simple, easy-to-use destination for all Australian women.
Refining the layout with a wireframe for a staff profile page
This project required significant focus around the content and information structure across the full suite of existing digital properties. We had to obtain a good understanding of those in order to inform the architecture of the new, single-property design that was planned, hopefully ensuring the delivery an optimal, consolidated experience that would work well for new and existing audiences alike.
The redesigned website is scalable for all devices
After performing extensive content audit and a number of detailed user research activities across the breadth of Jean Hailes’ visitors, we carefully crafted a radically simplified navigation, information architecture and content structure that centred specifically around user needs. The site employs intelligent content tagging and filtering throughout, for all health-related articles and resources by topic, life stage and audience, providing multiple pathways to all content.
The site redesign was an immediate success and has quickly become a key component in Jean Hailes’ offering. In the 18 month period after the launch of the website, the following statistics were observed: 
The redevelopment project of Jean Hailes’ women’s health portal is a true success story. The team at Thirst Studios understood our organisation and needs so well from the very beginning. We loved their processes and communications throughout the project and the delivery of the project was a great team effort. Their user research and UX consultation at the start of the project was outstanding and we learnt a lot about our audiences and user behaviour. Over two years down the track Thirst Studios is still our trusted partner for everything web and UX.

meta description:We are a leading User Experience (UX), Customer Experience (CX) & Service Design agency, based in Melbourne, Australia.

Elevating the Victorian Film industry to a global stage
Streamline eight web properties into one user centred experience.
Addressed key tasks to inform a logical Information Architecture.
Increased traffic, decreased bounce rates and a happy client.
Film Victoria is a much-respected organisation in Australia providing strategic leadership, funding and assistance to the film, television, game and digital media production industries in Victoria. 
When engaging Thirst Studios, Film Victoria had a clear strategic goal in mind – to promote Victoria as a world-class destination for film production on a global stage, by improving the level of services and online experience.
On a tactical level, the challenge presented was a consolidation of eight existing and divergent web properties into one unified experience that would be easier to maintain and provide a seamless, simple, personalised user experience for their visitors.
Of equal import, Film Victoria’s services and funding are vital in supporting the industry, however their online offering required a significant rethink of the way information was presented to users.
Outlining user flows to visualise possible solutions
Key to our approach was ensuring the correct funding program information could be easily found. We needed an understanding how industry stakeholders understood the division of funding between media types (Film, TV, Games etc.), the types of projects (Fiction, Documentary etc.) and project phases (Development, Production).
Through contextual research with stakeholders, workshops, interviews, surveys and card-sorting activities, we were able to prioritise current needs, and ensure the approach remained flexible to adapt to future needs of the industry. 
“It was crucial that the IA structure of the combined websites was designed to support key user journeys, and tested to ensure primary tasks could be easily completed.” 
The information architecture (IA) of the current offerings made it difficult to access information needed. The user journey of sourcing filming locations, searching for local talent, finding local production facilities and exploring current projects in productions required the user traversing 4 different websites, with no clear connectivity between them. 
It was crucial that the IA structure of the combined websites was designed to support key user journeys, and tested to ensure primary tasks could be easily completed.
Treejack testing to test the effectiveness of the Information Architecture
Our primary solution focussed on understanding user’s needs, and consolidating their experiences. We were able to create a single responsive website that answered to the key user tasks, concentrating on priority tasks like grant applications where needed, within an overarching and simplified site architecture. 
Through the use of this single site, Victorian screen industry professionals can seamlessly apply for funding, find support for their projects and explore the wealth of screen industry talent the state offers. International stakeholders can explore the world-standard filming locations and facilities and the fantastic productions supported by Victoria.
Launching in 2016, the year-on-year comparison for the first three months saw the following impact:

Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal | Thirst Studios 
Empathetic accessible advice for Victorians in dispute
Modernise and future proof a legacy site to be easy to navigate for public and staff alike.
Audit content and craft a logical IA. Redesign site paying particular attention to accessibility needs of users.
Sessions increased dramatically with more users being able to complete their tasks on the site.
By the time someone in Victoria decides to visit the VCAT website, the odds are things are going pretty badly for them; their dispute is being taken to tribunal!
VCAT is the busiest tribunal in Australia, with close to 100,000 stressed-out Victorians visiting the website each year seeking assistance in resolving their dispute. Deliberately more informal than the courts, VCAT encourages people to represent themselves. 
User testing the prototype to find out how useable the solution is 
The existing VCAT website provided a sub-optimal experience for visitors. The information architecture was complex and not designed around user needs, making it difficult to find relevant content. It was hard for administrators to maintain, and it displayed a number of usability issues. Additionally, the site was not optimised for small screen viewing, yet the statistics identified an increasingly mobile audience.
In many ways, this was the ultimate UX design challenge; Most visitors to VCAT only ever do so once in a lifetime, yet the process of coming to court is difficult to understand. This had to be a super-intuitive solution. Furthermore, the tribunal promotes low-cost, self-representation, so there’s a lot of important, yet typically complex information that needs to be mastered quickly. We had our work cut out with this one!
Outputs from a stakeholder workshop documenting user needs and goals
Our work started with a series of workshops and interviews with key internal stakeholders and website users, an extensive heuristic review and a series of benchmark, moderated user tests to better understand the existing landscape.
Having gained a deep understanding of the various user groups’ needs, we set to work making sense of the wealth of data at our fingertips. Working closely with our client, we co-designed a new solution from the ground-up, starting with an extensive content audit and Information Architecture redesign and ending with a detailed wireframe prototype that was used to test and iterate the design.
Finally, drawing from the outputs of the preceding phases, we designed and developed the solution in line with the organisation’s brand style-guide using the responsive web design methodology to accommodate a variety of screen sizes and resolutions. Given the breadth and diversity of the audience, accessibility considerations were of the utmost importance, so particular attention was paid to testing and reviewing the site in this regard, ensuring AA standards were met throughout.
The new VCAT website launched in July 2016 to great success and has quickly become a key part of their VCAT service offering. Both the business and it’s community have responded positively to the site, which is now providing a much better experience for both.

Helping university students stay informed and connected
Craft an integrated student portal that enables students to get on with learning.
Close consultation throughout and thorough testing to ensure a robust end product.
DeakinSync is an invaluable tool for students and staff across all Deakin campuses.
Deakin University is a well known Australian public university with campuses across the state of Victoria, serving around 60,000 students each year. 
The university approached us in August 2013 to provide UX consulting and design services for a groundbreaking new university portal for students.
The product - DeakinSync - would constitute a one-stop solution for students, furnishing them with everything they need to successfully navigate their way through their time at university. From calendars and unit site access to online collaboration, payments and a suite of software tools, the tool needed to be designed from the ground-up with the wide variety of student needs placed firmly at front-of-mind.
Sketching out concepts for the Dashboard
The platform needed to capture data from a wide variety of university systems, yet be flexible enough to deliver personalised content that was relevant to each individual student depending on their course, campus, and even the time of day that they would be logged in.
Following an extensive period of consultation workshops and interviews with various student user groups and university stakeholders, we designed and produced an intelligent interface that enables the delivery of personalised content across multiple device resolutions.
Multiple rounds of prototyping and testing were undertaken, with Thirst working predominantly on-site within Deakin’s Business Solutions team, delivering product strategy, research, UX/UI design and front end development.
We continued to consult throughout the development stages, working closely with Deakin’s own tech team to ensure that the product vision remained intact and was successfully delivered as originally intended.
The product has been an enormous success, with hugely positive feedback from students and university staff alike. It’s quickly become an invaluable, key tool for all students and staff across all Deakin campuses. 
DeakinSync has also been widely praised as a well-designed, leading, innovative solution amongst many other universities and research organisations across Australia.
