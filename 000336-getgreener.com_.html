				How does Greener for Business work?

That’s better for business and better for the planet.
				How does Greener’s climate action plan work?			
When you sign up for Greener for Business, we’ll ask you to tell us a bit about your business. We’ll then build a step-by-step plan to reduce emissions that’s tailored to you.
Energy, waste, electrification, transport, packaging and more, you’ll get access to easy-to-understand guides that help you take action – from simple things that can be tackled in less than a day, to more advanced actions that make a big impact.
We’ll help you start ticking off the quick wins, and celebrate your progress.
Plus, we’ll show you how it pays to get greener each step of the way, connect you with a handy network of suppliers that make it easy and help your business unlock real savings while taking climate action. 
				What does Greener mean by saying “getting greener”?			
We know not all shades of green are equal. But when it comes to climate change, there’s a lot of complicated jargon out there. 
E, net zero, true zero, carbon neutral, climate neutral 🤯
And the more complicated things get, the less likely people are to take action. 
So when we talk about getting greener, we keep things simple and focus on the things that matter the most to everyday Australians… ‘
What can we all do to help solve the problem?
For us, getting greener is about real, science-based benefits for our planet, but without having to have a science degree to understand what it means. 
In simple terms, getting to greener, means working towards net zero. It’s about taking steps that help cut emissions at the source, and ensuring that at least 90% of the energy being generated comes from 100% renewable sources (like wind or solar). 
				How does the Greener app work?			
Listing your business in the Greener app helps you reach highly qualified customers who are eager to support brands that help them reduce their climate impact.
When Greener app users shop with you – in-store or online – their purchases are automatically carbon offset, giving them more incentive to shop with you again.
And because we know 84% of Aussies consider a business’ sustainability credentials when deciding who to buy from,
 turning their purchases carbon neutral is something your customers will love you for – helping you attract more climate-conscious shoppers and increase your brand loyalty.
But it’s important to remember that offsetting alone isn’t a silver bullet for ending climate change.
That’s why Greener helps you tell your story and celebrates the great things you’re doing to reduce emissions across your entire business.
And for those that need some extra help knowing what to do next, Greener for Business has solutions to help reduce emissions at every stage, and stop CO
