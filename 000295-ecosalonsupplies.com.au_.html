meta title:Eco Salon Supplies
meta description:Eco Salon Supplies is the exclusive distributors of Oway in Australia and 
New Zealand. Welcome to the world of sustainable luxury. Oway offers 
premium hair & beauty products that are cruelty-free, chemical & toxin free 
using only pure, organic, bio-dynamic & Fair Trade ingredients.

Welcome to the world of sustainable luxury.
This is the virtuous circle of choices and actions that Oway put in place to improve the well-being of the Earth and its inhabitants, at every stage of the product life cycle.
At their Ortoffficina farm located in the Bologna Hills, Oway grows, harvests and distills in the healthiest and cleanest way to obtain pure, ultra-effective essentials oils, hydrolates and extracts that become active ingredients in their unique formulas.
All Oway formulas are packaged in glass and aluminium which are protective and completely recyclable. It’s important to eliminate all plastic and unnecessary packaging that damages the environment.
Oway works to reduce their environmental footprint by harnessing the power of the sun to run its facilities. 
Oway demonstrates that it is possible to obtain excellent product without using aggressive and toxic chemical substances. Their deep knowledge of plants and their secrets has led to unique formulas combining quality and effectiveness.
Where Oway cannot grow their own ingredients, they collaborate with international fair trade purchasing networks. Fair Trade purchasing guarantees farmers a fair return and dignified work conditions. 
PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is the largest world organisation for the protection of animal rights who have always been at the forefront in the fight against vivisection, experimentation and other brutal treatments of animals. Oway is proud to have this certification.
Their goal is to promote and inspire a healthy and positive way of life at the company, in the salon and in daily life. Oway staff drive electric cars, attend yoga and meditation classes and shop locally. Today, there is a global tribe of professionals, consumers and other individuals linked by the choice of healthy, effective and quality products and a responsible and sustainable lifestyle.
Oway believes that it is better to surround ourselves with a few products and objects that are sustainable and of high quality, rather than pursuing continuous, compulsive and excessive consumption. Consume less, consume better.
Everything you need to get started with oway.
For Salon Partner’s wanting a closer look at the Oway product offering.
For Salon Partner’s that want to use low-tox colours while achieving professional results. 
For Salon Partner’s that want the support of a high-quality biodynamic styling & finishing range.

meta title:Eco Salon Supplies
meta description:Eco Salon Supplies is the exclusive distributors of Sinesia in Australia 
and New Zealand. Welcome to a world of products and rituals from the neck 
up. Sinesia is the first beauty line that consciously blends the care of 
hair and skin with that of the head as a whole.

The Mind: the epicentre of our emotions, our control room
We take care of the mind, the place where every emotion is born, where our perceptions take shape and true well-being is created.
Time: the only luxury good that no one can give back to us
We live increasingly in the past or the future, never in the present: Our treatments help you live every moment to full, giving new value to your time.
GreenRich Beauty: the formula for staying well, today and tomorrow
Formulations rich in active ingredients based on biodegradable ingredients of natural origin: We want our well-being to be compatible with that of future generations.
Shampoos, hair and face masks, massage oils, nourishing creams, eye contour patches and many other products to take care of yourself and improve your psychophysical well-being.
The line designed to support the circadian rhythms that regulate our body and obtain the greatest possible benefit from the action of cosmetic products, acting when the skin and scalp are more predisposed to accept them.
The line for taking care of your beauty directly at home, as well as in the salon: products with an intensive action that is obtained during processing time. Real pampering to be enjoyed in a dimension of relaxation.
The Sinesia line that takes care of your beauty and that of the planet. Powder shampoo with sustainable packaging, which guarantee a concentrated action and therefore a greater number of applications compared to a traditional product.
The Sinesia line for the balance of the microbiota, the set of microorganisms that populate the skin and scalp and are responsible for their health: pre and post biotic treatments for a properly hydrated skin without impurities.
The line of enhancers or boosters. Designed to be used alone on the face or hair, or mixed with creams or masks, to enhance their specific action.
Sinesia Save the Color is the line that takes care of the intensity and brilliance of color with highly biodegradable formulas and a percentage of ingredients of natural origin that reaches up to 99%. Toning products, neutralizers of unwanted reflections and color revivers, guarantee a timeless, sophisticated and long-lasting look, associating the best credentials in terms of sustainability with performance on the hair.
It is the Sinesia line that comes from the concept of cold emulsions with a view to sustainability for a beauty routine suitable for every need through a selection of delicate formulas that offer long-lasting freshness, protection and hydration.
It is the Sinesia line dedicated to hair design . Stayling Alive , composed of high-performance and sensorial products, takes care of the hair at 360°, protecting it from external agents, smog, humidity, thermal and oxidative stress. In a short time Stayling Alive gives texture, control and silkiness to even the most difficult to tame hair .
The synergy between the product's ultra-sensorial textures, functional active ingredients, enveloping fragrances, delicate gestures and light strokes offers unique experiences combined with visible results.
These are the treatments that we offer to our professionals, to let their customers experience moments of pure relaxation. 
The face and neck are two very delicate skin areas that require specific treatments to maintain the elasticity and hydration necessary for their well-being. Sinesia has created 4 rituals, Nourish, Hydrate, Illuminate, and Detox, designed to help your clients achieve healthy and luminous skin.
Stress, pollution, seasonal changes: scalp and hair are very sensitive to the negative effects of the normal daily grind, with the result that they are often fragile, brittle and dull. To rebalance the well-being of your clients' scalps, Sinesia have structured 6 rituals that, depending on their specific needs, will help them finally have healthy, strong, and shiny hair, helping to restore the correct psycho-physical balance.
Massages and self-massages activate sensory processes at the level of the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems which stimulate the production of oxytocin and endorphins, physiological "antidepressant" hormones which facilitate a good mood, contain aging and wear and tear of the tissues and remove stress and a feeling of exhaustion.
To allow your salon to offer your customers a moment of pure relaxation, Sinesia has created 3 massages compatible with the Face & Neck treatments and another 2 to be integrated into the Skin & Hair rituals.
Join the Sinesia salon to access exclusive valuable content, including tutorials on product applications, technical data sheets, and insights.

You may have seen Phitofilos in Italy and now it’s available in Australia and New Zealand. An Italian 100% plant based, 100% high quality and the original vegetal hair colour. We are the official distributors of Phitofilos to salons across Australia & New Zealand. Your salon can offer the same 100% pure and natural experience for your clients.
Phitofilos stands on the side of the environment and people's health. This is why they formulate vegan, eco-bio and cruelty-free cosmetics with a natural INCI, following rigorous production processes and careful quality standards. Quality control is a priority and they work so that we can make an informed purchase choice, with maximum transparency.
The INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients) describes the composition of a cosmetic product, presenting the list of ingredients in descending order of concentration. An indispensable tool for knowing the characteristics of the product and checking if the substances used are eco-bio compatible.
All Phitofilos products are VeganOK guaranteed. Specifically, this standard guarantees that: no substance/part present in VeganOK brand products is of animal origin or directly and voluntarily implies the killing, possession or exploitation of animals. It is an ethical statement that affirms our principles.
Phitofilos cosmetic products (with the exception of herbs) are certified AIAB Bio Eco Cosmetics and QCertifications Certification of Quality. This means that the cosmetics are produced with organic raw materials, are GMO free, do not contain ingredients that are harmful to the person, the environment and do not require animal testing. Find out more about 
All Phitofilos products are subjected to patch tests, i.e. occlusive tests carried out on a group of volunteers that are carried out in accredited laboratories. This allows us to guarantee the absolute skin compatibility of all our cosmetics.
All Phitofilos cosmetic products are Nickel Tested <1PPM. This indicates that specific analyzes have been carried out to ensure that nickel within the product is less than one part per million (<1PPM). In fact, for cosmetic use the value below which the person most allergic to nickel has no problems is 1PPM.
All Phitofilos herbs are subjected to sterilisation procedures in order to guarantee safe and legal products. This process allows to break down the microbial load and eliminate the presence of pathogens (eg E.Coli, Pseudomonas, Staphilococcus Aureus), as well as yeasts and molds that are usually present in many plants from distant countries.
