meta description:1000 teams. 1000 trees. It's time to go wild.

1000 teams. 1000 trees. It's time to go wild. 
Fund the planting of 1 million trees
Welcome to the One Million Trees Challenge.
This is about more than just making a donation â this is about setting yourself and your team the challenge to go wild. Really connect with nature.
Go for a hike. Or find a park, take your shoes off and meditate. Earth yourself. Recharge. Breathe in that beautiful oxygen. One hour, anywhere with trees.Â 
And every time you do, capture that moment in the Good Empire app, and then make a small donation, which goes straight to our Impact Partners One Tree Planted to help reforest the world.
The earthâs wilds, our natural habitats, are still declining at an alarming rate. 10 million hectares a year. Emitting nearly 5 billion tonnes of CO2.Â 
Half the forests that once covered the land are gone, and only 20% are still undisturbed. If we keep going, we wonât have any rainforests by the year 2100.Â 
That means wildlife extinction on a mass scale, no oxygen, no carbon sequestering, no cooling of climate.
Itâs about the most impactful thing we can do for people and planet, is to help reforest the world.
Join the challenge. Set yourself a goal â maybe itâs 100 trees, over 10 actions.Â Â 
$10 is all it takes to get 10 trees planted.
And wonât that feel good, to have been part of something so simple and impactful, something good for your mind, good for the soul, and good for the planet?
Letâs do it, together. 1000 teams. One million trees. Letâs go wild.
1000 teams. 1000 trees a team. Thatâs our mission.
You can register your company as a team, or your team as a team, your school, club, or even invite your friends and family to come together as a team.
Set your own team goal, and go wild.
You can organise team nature walks or hikes, nature meditation sessions, meetings under a tree â feel free to get creative, as long as you go wild.Â 
As a team, there are three ways you can handle donations, all within the app:
1. 	Individuals take action and donate
2. 	Individuals take action, company donates
3. 	Individuals take action and donate, company matches donations
Iâve started a team. What do you say. You want to help us reach our goal of 1 million trees?
Are you ready to go wild and help us reach our target of 1 million trees?

meta description:1 summer. 100 teams. 10,000 people. 1 million ocean-bound plastics.

1 summer. 100 teams. 10,000 people. 1 million ocean-bound plastics.
Welcome to the Zero Ocean Plastics Challenge! 
Our mission is to gather, unite and empower 10,000 people to save 1 million ocean-bound plastics this summer. 
Every year, 8 million tonnes of plastic waste goes into our oceans, and destroys our ecosystems and decimates our marine life.Â 
Thatâs the equivalent of 15 garbage bags full of plastic rubbish piled up on every meter of coastline around the world. 
This is a simple challenge, but it's a profoundly impactful thing to do. Nothing drives home the truth about single use plastics like having to actually clean the mess up. 
On your own, or in a team, get outside and start hunting for ocean-bound plastics. 
Beach, lake, park, stormwater drainâ¦ hell - go outside now and check the gutter, because whatever you find will probably make its way into our oceans. 
Count your haul and log it in the Good Empire app. There's video capture too, so maybe you want to tell us what you found. How does it make you feel? Maybe you could talk us through whatâs recyclable and what isnât. 
And then you can share it out through your own socials - challenge your friends to join you; family, work mates - see if you can start your own ripple and inspire others to also take action. 
Because if not us, then who? And if not now, then when?
Weâre calling on 100 organisations who want to have impact, and want to engage their people, to come and help bring this movement to life with us. 
It's a powerful team, culture and community-building experience, it's so easy to do, and the Good Empire app allows you to track, video and share your action and impact with the world. 
With one smart link you can invite anyone to join your team - employees, customers, your whole community, you can all be doing it remotely, from anywhere in the world, but feel like youâre all coming together. Doing something real and impactful, together.
Cost is a once-off registration fee of $250 USD.
Will you join this growing cohort of orgs who are gathering, uniting and empowering their employees, customers and community to do their part in helping us save 1 million ocean-bound plastics? 
Are you ready to level up this summer and help save our oceans and marinelife?
