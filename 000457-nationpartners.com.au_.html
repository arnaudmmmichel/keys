meta title:About us - Nation Partners
meta description:We attract the very best people and we want them to love what they do. We offer a positive work culture that keeps us engaged and inspired to be our best.

We exist to work with like-minded clients to influence a better and more sustainable future for society and the planet
We have always been curious to find better ways to deliver projects. We love the work we do and genuinely care about the outcomes we achieve. It takes courage to pioneer new thinking and leading capabilities to understand the problem and provide clarity on the solution.
We value sustainable outcomes over everything else. Relationships are the mechanism that allows us to do great work.
We provoke the thinking of the ambitious people we partner with, who are trying to make real and lasting change.
We’re driven by outcomes, and use data and robust analysis to reveal the issue and set direction.
We wanted to create a business that was Purpose Driven and had a strong environmental and social conscience. As a profit with purpose business, we knew that we would attract certain types of people that shared a vision of doing more than just growing a consulting business. “Leading the change to a better way of doing business” was our mantra for many years, and as we have evolved, we have defined what this looks like. Distributed leadership, self-management, capability building and a reward and progression system that transparently sees us all share in the business’ success.
Being employee owned has always been an important part of the plan. Having control over our destiny is important and creates a model where all staff can be business owners. This ensures we can direct our collective energy (and profits) towards solving some of the planet’s most challenging problems.
We attract the brightest minds and make a significant investment in developing and nurturing our people to ensure they live their best life and can deliver exceptional outcomes for our clients. Our curious nature allows us to better understand problems and apply our skills to solving some of the toughest challenges facing society and the planet.
BCorp – a force for good
We have been a B Corporation since the very start. Using business as a force for good just makes sense. For the last 4 years we have been ranked in the top 10% of B Corps globally for what we do to support our workers and provide a positive, flexible and transparent workplace. As a profit with purpose business, we have donated more than $100,000 to environmental and social challenges facing society and the planet. Our climate change strategy and giving framework looks to integrate our volunteering, pro bono and workplace giving and we are constantly looking at how we can make an even greater positive impact.
Nation Partners is committed to furthering reconciliation initiatives through the development of a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). This RAP has been developed in consultation with Reconciliation Australia and form a fundamental pillar of the Nation Partners business model. The RAP was finalised in November 2022.
The RAP makes commitments to build cultural understanding, respect and involvement across the business and provide clear procurement pathways for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander industry participation.
This is the first RAP developed by Nation Partners and intends to lay the foundations to establish the best approach for advancing reconciliation in the workplace.
                We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we work and live, and recognise and respect their continuing connection to land, water and community. We pay respect to Elders past, present and emerging.

Problem solving is at the core of what we do. Leading thinkers want the toughest problems to solve and we are passionate about applying our talent and collaborating to shape outstanding outcomes for our clients.
Economic Evaluation and Strategic Business Case
Nation Partners provided strategic economic and business case advisory services to Local Land Services and Landcare NSW in evaluating the impact of the current NSW Landcare Program, and to support a funding submission to continue Landcare’s impact within the State, through the development of a strategic business case. Our work has provided further clarity on the quantum of Landcare’s impact within NSW, helping to articulate the movement’s contribution to its volunteers and the environment, and position it for ongoing success.
We provided business case development and project management services to support the assessment of a large and complex project to reimagine Arts Centre Melbourne and the Melbourne Arts Precinct, since announced as a once-in-a-generation transformation of Victoria’s pre-eminent cultural precinct. The overarching precinct plan included the upgrade of Arts Centre Melbourne, the establishment of a new National Gallery of Victoria Contemporary gallery, and the creation of an 18,000 square metre immersive public garden connecting the arts precinct.
Nation Partners is the lead communications and community engagement advisor on Australia’s first offshore wind project, Star of the South. As Australia’s energy sector is transforming, Star of the South is at the forefront of Victoria’s clean energy future. Embedded in the core project team, we are trusted advisors working to build awareness and grassroots support for the proposal and delivering authentic communications and stakeholder relations services to manage risks and provide positive outcomes for Gippsland.
Since December 2019, Nation Partners has provided sustainability support to the Sustainability Program at Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP). Nation Partners’ support includes project management and delivery of a range of discrete sustainability management system elements, including internal business process, such as LXRP Business-as-Usual Assumption Guideline. Our team has also directly supported LXRP through secondment, assisting delivery of various program management activities, including program compliance and reporting regimes for the project’s five delivery alliances.
As the Independent Environmental Auditor (IEA) for the North East Link Early Works project, we have provided specialist environmental compliance and auditing services across a broad range of technical disciplines.  Our main responsibility has been to review, verify and audit compliance of CPBs environmental management documentation and works with the Project Contract, environmental management framework, environmental performance requirements and conditions of project approvals.  
To support organisational sustainability commitments, Development Victoria sought to improve their understanding of the sustainable finance landscape and its opportunities. We provided a review of emerging funding and financing mechanisms and assessed their relevance to Development Victoria’s sustainability focus areas and typical project typologies. This study, captured the mechanics, advantages, unknowns and case studies for a range of asset classes, partnership opportunities, procurement approaches, energy-related initiatives and public and private financing options.
Our team is providing strategic and technical guidance to NSW Government in relation to contaminated land across the lifecycle of the Sydney Metro program – Australia’s largest public transport initiative. Having developed a contaminated land management strategy, our team is supporting property acquisition, site investigations, environmental impact assessments, construction works and precinct development across the Sydney Metro program.
Nation Partners supports Fire & Rescue NSW’s (FRNSW) program to investigate and manage the potential presence and impacts of per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) at its sites. Providing technical, strategic and stakeholder advice, we enable PFAS impacts to be understood and managed across diverse properties in the FRNSW portfolio. Our rapid responses, and success working with regulators and the community, lead to positive outcomes.
We supported Farmers for Climate Action to engage with farmers and industry bodies across Australia to explore what is needed from a national policy for climate change and agriculture. We conducted a policy and literature review and analysed survey results to understand the needs of farmers responding to climate change. The 
Farming Forever: A National Plan for Climate Change and Agriculture Report 
brings together the voices of over 600 farmers and industry stakeholders, highlighting practical measures to future-proof Australian farms. 
Pioneer Bay Waterway Diversion & Wetland
Working alongside Aquametro Services and Melbourne Water we have minimised environmental impacts through informed design and siting and obtained statutory approvals for construction of the wetland and waterway diversion. We worked with designers to avoid ecologically significant habitat and significant impacts to Matters of National Environmental Significance (MNES) under the EPBC Act. We engaged early with Council and referral authorities to streamline application timeframes and reduce schedule risk. 
GRESB Submission, Materiality Assessment and Climate Resilience Advisory
Our team assisted GeelongPort to undertake its first assessment against the global environment, social and governance (ESG) investor sustainability assessment 
. Coupled with this work, we supported the ESG materiality assessment, considering the perspectives of internal and external stakeholders, as well as industry best practice, to identify priority issues for action. We prepared guidance material on the approach to addressing the GRESB resilience module and undertook a climate change risk assessment for physical and transition risks.
Our team developed a greenhouse gas calculation tool for the construction and operation phases of Inland Rail. With 13 packages across 1,700 kilometers, ARTC required a consistent approach to determining greenhouse gas emissions across each package. The tool took into account business-as-usual assumptions around energy consumption during construction and operational phases which then enabled an assessment of the energy and greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with the integration of sustainability initiatives. The final tool was provided to each design and construct package across Victoria.
Nation Partners led a pilot project for the City of Melbourne to better understand the impact of extreme heat on critical interconnected urban systems and services across metro-Melbourne. The project involved extensive engagement with stakeholders from Melbourne’s nine critical urban infrastructure systems, and in-depth analysis of how climate events impact their components, the subsequent effects that arise from the interdependencies between systems, and flow-on effects to city users. From this, potential strategic adaptation interventions that could mitigate impacts were identified.
To support organisational sustainability commitments, Development Victoria wanted better understanding of the sustainable finance landscape and its potential opportunities. We provided a review of emerging funding and financing mechanisms and assessed their relevance to Development Victoria’s sustainability focus areas and project typologies. This study captured the mechanics, advantages, unknowns and case studies for a range of asset classes, partnership opportunities, procurement approaches, energy-related initiatives, and public and private financing options.
Nation Partners is providing an integrated suite of communications and engagement services to support the Victorian School Building Authority (VSBA) as it delivers on an unprecedented investment in education infrastructure.
We have worked collaboratively with the Level Crossing Removal Project since its inception, delivering strategic communications, stakeholder engagement and landowner engagement services.  Whether we were working with landowners or community members, who were disrupted by level crossing projects, our approach and professionalism helped build relationships and create understanding with communities and stakeholders.
Our team has been providing strategic advice and communications and engagement support on the North East Link Project. Pivotal to North East Link’s approach is a genuine focus on involving community, local interest groups and key stakeholders in the Project’s development. Nation Partners has been central in assisting NELP establish a number of Community Liaison Groups, engagement workshops and forums; including a first-of-its-kind Community Technical Discussion Group.
We supported Infrastructure Victoria with the development and rollout of a comprehensive stakeholder and community engagement program to help inform Victoria’s first 30-Year Infrastructure Strategy. Our detailed analysis and reporting of consultation feedback was critical to guiding decision making on Victoria’s infrastructure needs and priorities.
Partnership Expression of Interest for the Enabling Liveability Project
Nation Partners was engaged by Melbourne Water to provide specialist advisory and stakeholder engagement services to develop a partnership Expression of Interest (EOI) process for its Enabling Liveability Project. With the aim to ascertain the level of interest from prospective partners to deliver and financially support liveability activation initiatives at priority retarding basin and water supply pipetrack sites, Nation Partners adopted an engagement centered approach to identify suitable tactical planning options, develop partnering principles and develop a robust end-to-end partnership EOI process.
Zero Emissions South East Melbourne Roadmap Rationale
South East Councils Climate Change Alliance (SECCA) and Greater South East Melbourne (GSEM)
We supported Greater South East Melbourne (GSEM) to articulate the economic rationale for decarbonisation planning. We identified the social, political, and economic pressures for reducing emissions, and explained how these could translate into real risks and opportunities for the region. We provided a compelling case for the development of a proactive and multi-stakeholder zero emissions roadmap.
Nation Partners provided business case development, operational review and advisory services to support governance reforms by the Victorian Government to deliver a resilient, efficient and sustainable Victorian commercial ports system, working in collaboration across several assignments with Freight Victoria and Ports Victoria. Our team also supported the preparation and release of the Victorian Commercial Ports Strategy which sets out the government’s vision, strategy and actions for the sector.
Nation Partners led the development of a Zero Net Emissions Strategy for NSW Ports. The project involved identifying their emissions profile, including Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and identifying potential mitigation actions to inform their 2022 to 2025 Strategy. Mitigation opportunities were reviewed in a facilitated workshop and prioritised for inclusion in the Strategy. Advice was also provided on offset options for residual emissions.
                We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land on which we work and live, and recognise and respect their continuing connection to land, water and community. We pay respect to Elders past, present and emerging.
