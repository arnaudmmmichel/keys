These three P's drive decision making to ensure that The Common Good Company (TCGCo) 
‘is in the benefit or interest of all.’
 This is through meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their needs.
‘1kg of cotton requires over 11,000 litres of water. That’s more than 9 times the amount an average adult drinks in a year. A single cotton T-shirt costs the Earth 2,700 litres of fresh water.’
TCGCo defines more sustainable materials as those that reduce the environmental impact of a product through better chemistry, lower resource intensity, less waste and/or recyclability. 
At TCGCo, we are constantly learning, evolving, challenging and improving our manufacturing processes to operate as sustainably and ethically as possible. These are some of manufacturing and operational decisions we have established to contribute to a more sustainable future.
By using Recycled Pre-consumer textile waste and Recycled Polyester in our garments, we have eliminated the unnecessary waste, water use, land use and pollution that are typically involved with the production of yarns made from virgin materials.

By developing our own 100% Recycled Material, we have eliminated the use of Earth's finite resources required in growth and harvest of cotton plants.
Each TCGCo T-shirt uses 60% Recycled Pre-Consumer Cotton. 
Pre-Consumer Cotton is the cotton waste that is found on the cutting room floors. Textile waste accounts for as much as 20% of the total fabric volumes used by garment manufacturers. By repurposing and recycling this cotton we divert this waste from landfill. 
The first step in recycling cotton is sorting the waste by type and colour. Next, the sorted fabrics are mechanically ripped into strips, then unravelled into fibres. The resulting fibres are shorter than new fibres, making it harder to spin them. This is why our recycled cotton is mixed with Recycled Polyester, ensuring the quality and strength of the yarn.
40% Recycled Polyester (RPET) makes up the remaining composition of the t-shirt. Recycled Polyester is spun along with Recycled Cotton to increase the strength and durability of the yarn.
By using recycled polyester, it means that the raw material comes from single-use objects like Plastic Water Bottles (4.5 bottles per t-shirt). This reduces the amount of plastic ending up in landfills and the oceans. 
More importantly, it means that no virgin oil has been used to create the fibre.

Employing sustainable practises does not stop with the fabrics we choose.
We follow our Common Good ethos all the way through to the delivery of your items and the packaging they arrive in. 
These are some of the small steps that we are making towards a better future, let’s walk together. 
 ensures all TCGCo items come wrapped in custom FSC Certified Tissue paper and are sent out to you in a reusable and compostable bag.  We are pleased to be a part of the Eco Packaging Alliance.
At TCGCo we strive to reduce our Carbon Emissions by:
• Selecting less carbon intensive modes of transport (Fact: Sea transport uses 26 times less carbon than Air Freight.)
, a certified BCorp who operate Australia's first 100% Carbon neutral delivery service.
• Where we can not avoid Air Transport, we adopt environmental policies, investing in Carbon Offsetting programs such as our friends at 
"Everytime you make a purchasing decision, you are casting a vote for the kind of world you want to live in." 
That is why at TCGCo we use the following services for ‘The Common Good’...
Living off the grid (by the coast and in a treehouse) is the pipeline dream... in the interim we use 
 - Australia’s greenest power company who offset all carbon emissions required to power the TCGCo Home/Office. 
 who put people before profit and ensure that money is never loaned to industries (e.g coal, nuclear weapons, gambling, tobacco, live animal export) that do harm. 
What is better than high speed internet? An internet provider that gives a shit, that is why we use 
 - a BCorp who fund home internet connection for disadvantaged Aussie families.  Not only that, the owner lives in our neighbourhood so we know we're contributing to our local community and keeping the funds within our economy.
When we do have a spare a minute to wipe our bums we do so with 
 - another local BCorp who uses recycled paper and bamboo fibres to make Toilet Paper. These legends donate 50% of profits to help build toilets for the 2.3 billion people (almost 40% of population) who currently live without them.
And while we're in the bathroom it would remiss of us not to mention the team over at 
 who clean our teeth whilst directing 100% of their profits towards funding primary health programs in remote Indigenous communities throughout Australia.
