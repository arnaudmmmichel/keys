23 Degrees. Good Coffee Roasters Melbourne.
. Located in Melbourne’s Bayside we love crafting a beautiful cup of coffee, connecting people and sharing stories. And for the days when life sucks, we make sure your coffee never does. We source and roast the best coffee beans from around the world. All coffees are freshly roasted in small batches in Melbourne.
We believe good coffee comes from good people, better farming practices and collectively doing the right thing. And because actions speak louder than words, we’re walking the talk, going the extra mile, playing fair. Yes, we are proud of what we do.
Playing fair is an action term. We work hard to give our talented smallholder coffee farmers, women coffee growers and independent family farms, a fairer share of a cup of coffee. For us this means 
buying coffees at fair and ethical prices
This helps our coffee farmers to keep growing those tasty beans we love to roast and you love to drink. This is good for the farmer and it is good for you.
over the years. And we love growing together with our partners because we know we do better together. 
We create opportunities and advance women.
Our sourcing strategy and social projects
We know that together we are creating better opportunities for women and their families. That’s why we not only 
source a large portion of our coffees directly from women coffee growers
 that create a profound change for women coffee growers, their families and communities.
We believe in good business and doing the right thing
. That’s why, in 2018, we became one of only a few Certified B Corp coffee roasters in Australia. 
Being a B-Corp challenges us daily to be mindful of the impact our business decisions – big or small – have on our coffee-growing communities, our partners, our people, you (our customers) and the environment.
We are a Climate Active Carbon Neutral certified organisation.
Limiting climate change demands substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from our human activities. We recognise that we all have a vital role to play.
That’s why we have taken action to reduce and remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as we put into it. Since 2022 
23 Degrees? What's with the name?
Have you ever wondered what’s behind our name, ‘23 Degrees' Coffee Roasters? Haha, it is not the temperature at which we roast our delicious coffee beans. 
Instead, 23 Degrees refers to the 
coffee belt between the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north of the equator, and the Tropic of Capricorn, 23.5 degrees south
. In that area - between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn - you find ideal conditions for growing the world’s best coffees. Clever, right?

Why do we then create coffee blends instead of offering straight single origins? Good question. 
Well, think of it like a baking recipe. Instead of baking a straight chocolate brownie, you may want to balance its sweetness with some tartness and mix in raspberries. That's what we do when we create an espresso blend. We blend coffees that complement each other, considering sweetness, acidity, chocolate and/or fruity flavours, and a long aftertaste to give you a balanced blend. A stand-alone single origin coffee is unlikely to tick all the boxes. That's why we create coffee blends.
The philosophy behind our Espresso Blends.
The philosophy behind our coffee blends is deeply connected to our values as a coffee roaster, a proud B-Corp and carbon neutral organisation. 
Did you know more than 20 million smallholder farming families depend worldwide on coffee and produce most coffees? But being a small fish in a big pond isn't easy. That's why we've created our Morning Glory coffee blend to celebrate the fantastic coffees grown by millions of smallholder farming families worldwide.
We love to seek out amazing coffees directly from women coffee growers. because we know that together we are creating better opportunities. That's why we've created our Mrs Robinson Blend with coffee 100% sourced from female growers.
We recognise that each of us has a vital role to play in limiting climate change. Organic coffees due to its lighter carbon footprint is a great way to incorporate a good habit. That's why we are sourcing more and more organic coffees and created this tasty organic espresso blend. Yep, Bees Knees.
Our espresso blends are so tasty because we've opted to source only high-quality single-origin coffees that are fully traceable for our coffee blends. You can trace each coffee in our blends to its farm, coop or washing mill. We think that's simply better.

What is a single origin coffee?
Single origin means these coffees are sourced from a single producer, single farm, region or washing station. Two essential things differentiate single origin coffees from blends: identifiable origin characters and traceability.
With a single origin coffee you can explore the unique flavour profile of a particular terroir, coffee varietal and processing method. In a world of coffee, there are incredibly weird and wonderful flavours to explore, and there is nothing better when you find your cup of coffee. A single origin, lets you explore this.
An increasingly important thing about single origins is that it is traceable to the farm, region, cooperative or washing station and its coffee varietal and processing method. That way, we can assure quality and traceability and that a fair price has been paid upstream of the coffee supply chain to the producer.
A coffee's origin defines its taste. The soil, elevation, climate, and the location within the coffee growing belt that spans around the world all create the flavours that is revealed in the cup.
Whilst even within a region, coffees can be incredibly diverse, there are certain flavour profiles you can expect when selecting a single origin coffee from a specific country. 
Ethiopia: Hugely diverse from citrus, to floral to wildly fruity flavours. 
Kenya: Intense acidity. Syrupy blackcurrant profiles.
India: Heavy body and low in acidity.
Indonesia: Earthy, spicy, licorice root profiles with little acidity. Heavy body.
PNG: Wonderful sweet, juicy and a great body.
Brazil: Chocolatey and nutty, sweet, smooth and creamy. Lower acidity.
Colombia: Diverse from chocolatey sweet to delightful juicy. 
Peru: Heavy body. Sweet and soft.
Costa Rica: Lighter body. Clean and sweet.
Panama: Delicate cup. Citrus and floral flavours.

Is organic coffee better for the planet? Absolutely. Organic farming uses organic fertilisers and agroforestry principles where native trees, scrubs and fruits trees are grown around coffee trees, storing carbon, protecting the local ecosystem and promoting a healthy soil. Healthy soil supports plant growth, including nutrient cycling, biological control of plant pests, and the regulation of water and air supply.
Did you know that approximately 44% of a cup of coffee’s carbon footprint is generated at the farm level throughout the growing, harvesting and processing activities?
 Much of that footprint is due to synthetic fertilisers and pesticides in conventional coffee cultivations.
Moving from conventional coffees to organic coffees can reduce these emissions by one-third. That's why we buy 55% of our coffees grown at certified organic coffee farms or wild-grown. These coffees were cultivated without the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides.

Have you fallen in love with the ritual of preparing your filter coffee? Then, you'll enjoy experiencing our single-origin filter coffees. We roast our filter coffees to a 
 That means we roast the coffee shorter and finish the roast with a lower end-roast temperature. The result: a 
cleaner cup profile, wonderful distinctive flavours, and heightened acidity.
What are the best brewing methods for using filter coffees? 
Lighter roasted coffee beans are less porous than darker roasted coffee. As a result, when you brew a filter coffee, the coffee's solubles, the tasty bits, extract more slowly. That's why lighter roasted coffees are best suited to slower extraction methods such as 
What processing method is best for filter coffees?
Well, that depends on the flavours you'll.

. That's because after the coffee cherries have been harvested, they are left intact and spread out to dry in the sun. That allows the beans inside the coffee cherries to draw in all those yummy fruit flavours and 
pronounced acidity and often floral notes
. In the washed processing method, the outer skin and most of the fruit flesh is separated from the coffee bean in a procedure called de-pulping. The coffee is then moved into fermentation tanks with clean water, where the remainder of the fruit flesh is removed by fermentation.
f you are after a fruit bomb, look for natural-processed filter coffees
Washed coffees are for you if you are after a clean cup with pronounced acidity.
Think V60, Chemex, Kalita, Moccamaster ...
Drip coffees are prepared by simply pouring hot water over a bed of ground coffee. This pouring action is either done manually (pour over) or with the aid of an automatic coffee maker (batch brew).
Both, pour over and batch brew, allow gravity to draw the water through the coffee bed and filter the extracted coffee into a vessel. The hot water and the coffee grounds are in contact for a shorter period. The water extracts the coffee’s solubles and oils in a constant flow without clogging the paper filter (provided you have the correct grind size). 
Based on the brewing device and paper filter thickness, filter drip coffees catch nearly all of the extracted oils and ultrafine particles. The result is a 
cleaner cup with a lighter mouthfeel which lets the coffee flavours and acidity shine
Because of the drip coffees’ ability to highlight the subtle nuances of the coffee, this brewing method is well suitable for using a lighter roast profile.
Think plunger coffee, AeroPress, Clever Dripper …
These coffee brewing devices use a full immersion technique. That means the coffee grounds are fully immersed in water extracting the coffee’s solubles and oils over a longer time. The eternally popular plunger-style coffee uses a metal filter to separate the extracted coffee from the coffee grounds and allows its natural oils and fine particles (sediment) to pass through into your cup. This gives plunger coffees a 
richer and bigger mouthfeel but makes it harder to experience more subtle sensory notes
Whatever your preferred filter brewing method, it won’t change the flavour of your coffee, but will affect how different flavours are accentuated and shine through.
What grind size should you choose for filter brewing?
Filter coffees that we roast to a lighter roast profile are well-suited to be enjoyed across various brewing methods. The brewing method determines the grind size and will make a big difference in your coffee's taste. How so?
Well, have you ever wondered how the tasty bits of coffee beans end up in your brew? The key is extraction. Coffee extraction can be described as the process during which water infuses the roasted ground coffee and passes all the tasty (and sometimes not so tasty) bits into your cup. Now, not all of the coffee bean is soluble when it comes into contact with water. Only an estimated 30% are soluble, and of that 30%, only 2/3 are considered good solubles, so the tasty bits you want to extract.
Solubles are extracted at different times during the extraction process. Fortunately, the 'bad' solubles, the not-so-tasty ones, take longer to dissolve and therefore are released last. If the grind size is too fine, your paper filter will clog up. That means your coffee grounds are in contact with the hot water for longer, and you'll probably end up with a bitter brew. To avoid this, grind a bit coarser. Or try to brew smaller batches. You can also experiment with the water temperature. Try hotter water to extract solubles faster and avoid clogging the filter.
What happens if you have a grind size that is too coarse? That means you'll likely have too little contact time between the water and your ground coffee to extract enough of those tasty solubles, and you'll end up with a watery, sour-tasting brew.

99.9% of the caffeine are removed
 throughout the Swiss Water decaffeination process. That's why every decaf production is sampled and tested in the Swiss Water lab to ensure it meets this threshold. 
What makes our decaf coffee so tasty?
Decaf is coffee - just without caffeine. For selecting our decaf coffee beans, we apply the same rigour as we apply to any of our other coffees. We look for sweetness, unique flavours, body and some sparkle to make the cup balanced and interesting. 
Every coffee roasts differently, and nothing holds truer than roasting decaf coffee beans. Too often, you may have come across decaffeinated coffee that oozes oils. Not very inviting, right? The coffee beans are soaked in water throughout the Swiss Water Process, which softens the bean cell structure. The softer coffee beans absorb heat faster throughout the roasting process. And if roasted too hot or for too long, they can become noticeably oily. That’s why we apply a gentler roasting approach to our decaf coffee beans so that those tasty oils won't leach out and your decaffeinated coffee tastes delicious.
The Swiss Water process: Chemical-free and tasty.
Ever wondered how the caffeine is removed from coffee beans?
Now, the biggest challenge in removing caffeine without removing the other tasty soluble compounds. The Swiss Water process uses a clever ingredient - the caffeine-deficient green coffee extract concentrate called GCE.
GCE is created by soaking green coffee beans in very hot water. The soluble compounds including caffeine) are dissolved in the water throughout that soaking process. The water is then passed through a carbon filter. The larger caffeine molecules are caught by the filter and the remaining solubles pass through the filter. The filtered water now contains soluble compounds without caffeine and is called green coffee extract or, in short, GCE. This extract is used to decaffeinate a fresh batch of coffee.
A batch of fresh coffee beans is placed in water supersaturated with soluble coffee compounds minus the caffeine – the GCE. 
Now with the fresh coffee added, there is an imbalance between the solubles in the coffee beans, which include the caffeine and the GCE water, which contains all the solubles except for caffeine. To create an equilibrium, the caffeine from the coffee beans slowly migrates (leaches) into the GCE water until the caffeine in the coffee bean water and in the GCE water is in balance.  After the caffeine leaches from the coffee beans into the GCE water, it is passed through carbon filters to trap the larger caffeine molecules. 
This process is repeated using freshly flushed GCE until the caffeine is removed. The clever thing is that the tasty solubles of the coffee remain in the coffee bean, so they don’t leach into the GCE water. That’s because the GCE water is already saturated with those soluble. Clever, right?   The result is decaf coffee beans without the loss of flavour.
I’m hooked! I purchase the decaf and honestly have to say it’s the best I’ve tasted. I can’t believe how quickly my order is dispatched and delivered, and the personalised hand written notes I receive with each order are such a cute little touch. If you’re looking for decaf, look no further. I also have no doubt the rest of the range is equally outstanding! Love, love, love 23 Degrees Coffee xx
They have the best natural swiss-water method organic decaf coffee. Customer service is superior and friendly. Response times and postage times are quick. 
I thought I'd try to reduce my coffee(caffeine) intake, I'd never been a fan of decaf due to it all tasting like an Italian espresso blend from the 90s. 
Enter your (23 Degrees) decaf, wow this completely changed my mind about how decaf could taste, it made me think that coffee was possible without the caffeine. 
Just a really quick note to say that it was the best surprise to see our order turn up on our doorstep this afternoon. I know we're pretty close to you guys and just wanted to send an email of gratitude. We devastatingly ran out of THE BEST DECAF IN THE WORLD yesterday (because we went through it far more quickly than imagined) and so I am very happy to be back on the good stuff for tomorrow morning's routine.

About your coffee subscription - FAQs
                    How do I access my current coffee subscriptions?
Please note, you can not access your subscriptions directly via your 23 Degrees customer account as the subscription service is provided by a third-party application. 
Log in to your account. Note you have to be logged in before continuing to step 2
Alternatively, you can access your subscription by following these steps:
Locate your order confirmation email. Select 'View order'
In the order summary, under the subscription section, select 'Manage your subscription'. This will take you to your subscriptions. From there, you can manage them. 
Easy peasy. Select the subscription with the coffees you love. Then, at check-out, we will ask you to create an account. Through that account, you can self-manage your subscription whenever needed.
                    Is there a minimum length of my coffee subscription?
There is no minimum length when you sign up for one of our coffee subscriptions. That means you can cancel anytime.
                    Can I select different coffees to be included in one subscription cycle?
Absolutely. When you sign up for your coffee subscription, you can select different coffees in your subscription. Please note, though, the same delivery frequency and days apply to all coffees in one subscription.
If you wish to receive coffee deliveries with different shipment frequencies, we suggest you set up separate coffee subscriptions handled in individual transactions.
                    What if I go slower through my coffee then anticipated?
If you find yourself drinking less coffee than you thought, you have several options. You can pause your coffee subscription any time, push out the next delivery or skip the next delivery altogether. 
                    What if I go through my coffee faster than I thought?
We think that's a great thing - you enjoy your coffee subscription! If you find you are gobbling up your coffee faster, you can bring forward the date of your next shipment or increase the quantity of coffee in your subscription.
                    How much coffee should I order based on my daily coffee-drinking habits?
Good questions. There are a few things to consider when deciding the right quantity of your coffee subscription. 
If you drink roughly 2 cups per day we suggest you'd estimate 250g of coffee per week. Now you can sign up for a weekly delivery of 250g, fortnightly of 500g or a monthly delivery of 1kg. That’s up to you. What you might want to consider, though, are your shipping costs. We offer free shipping of orders over $50 per shipment. That means a 1kg order per shipment cycle of your coffee subscription would generally give you free delivery. And even better, fewer deliveries mean a lighter carbon footprint for your cup of coffee.  
If you are worried about the freshness of your coffee, there is no need to be. We ship your coffee freshly roasted. That means you usually receive your coffee within 1 week of the roasting date. So if you’d order coffee for 1 month, you’d sip the last of your coffee supply within 5 weeks of roasting. You won’t notice much (if any) leaching of tasty flavour compounds before 6-8 weeks from the roasting date. 
                    Can I cancel my coffee subscription at any time?
There are no strings attached to your coffee subscription. You can cancel any time before your next shipment, and the associated payment is due. 
Shipping for your subscription is free when you order coffee over $50 per subscription cycle.
For transactions that include coffee subscriptions with different delivery intervals (for example, a monthly subscription and a fortnightly), the free shipping threshold of >$50 needs to be met per subscription which the same subscription interval. That means two subscriptions with different subscription intervals will be treated as two seperate orders.
                    Do I pay as I go or in advance?
You pay as you go. When you set up your coffee subscription, you enter your preferred payment method, and the amount based on your selected coffees will be deducted when your shipment comes up. Easy right?
I'm loving the subscription. Great coffee - ethically sourced and fresh roasted. Excellent customer service and knowing about farmers and place of origin makes the coffee a bit more
A few weeks into our subscription now and really happy with everything we have tried so far. The coffee is always lovely and fresh, sent promptly on schedule and with a friendly little handwritten note. Love opening the package and seeing which new coffee we'll get to try each fortnight.
The quality and consistency of the beans from 23 Degrees are outstanding. The service is second to none. Highly recommended.
