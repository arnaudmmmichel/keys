Compostable Bin Liners & Rubbish Bags
The business was started in 2002 by Anibal and Holly Zarate as then Gourmet Organic Herbs.
At the time Holly was studying to become an Herbalist and through this became passionate about organics and food as medicine.
Anibal came from a background in hospitality and both he and Holly were also big foodies, and so both saw the opportunity to combine these passions to create a unique business. The quality of the raw materials is one of the cornerstones of Gourmet Organic's business.
The colour, fragrance and vibrancy of the varied herbs and spices are inseparable from their being grown and processed organically.
Gourmet Organic Herbs grew from a market business into one that now supplies health food / grocers / butchers / independent supermarket stores in all states of Australia. The range of products has also grown from just herbs and spices to incorporate salad dressings, mustards and vinegars. Providing high quality organic raw materials for food manufacturers in bulk has also become another aspect of the business.
And so in early 2017, Gourmet Organic worked really long and hard to come up with a vision that would take Gourmet Organic Herbs into the future. Gourmet Organic has been revitalised as Gourmet Organic with a fresh new logo to go with it. Gourmet Organic is still the same operation run by Anibal (and Holly) but has given the business a new lease of life and vitality. Gourmet Organic hopes you love the new look as much as they do and moving forward there will be lots of exciting new things to come from Gourmet Organic.

The Power of Healing Balms and Rubs: Natural Remedies for Aches and Pains
Healing balms and rubs have been used for centuries as natural remedies for various ailments. Packed with potent herbs, essential oils, and carrier oils, these topical ointments offer relief and promote healing. In this blog post, we'll explore the benefits and uses of healing balms and rubs, shedding light on their effectiveness in soothing aches and pains.
: One of the primary applications of healing balms and rubs is in relieving muscle and joint discomfort. These products are often infused with ingredients like menthol, camphor, arnica, and eucalyptus, which provide a cooling or warming sensation to the affected area. When massaged into the skin, these balms and rubs stimulate blood circulation, reduce inflammation, and alleviate pain. Whether it's post-workout muscle soreness or chronic joint stiffness, these natural remedies can offer soothing relief.
: Healing balms and rubs are not just limited to muscles and joints; they can also aid in skin healing. With ingredients like aloe vera, calendula, lavender, and tea tree oil, these products possess antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. They can be used to treat minor cuts, burns, insect bites, and bruises. Additionally, the moisturising properties of carrier oils like coconut or jojoba oil can help hydrate and rejuvenate dry or damaged skin.
: One of the advantages of healing balms and rubs is their natural composition. Unlike conventional products that may contain synthetic chemicals, these remedies are often crafted from plant-based ingredients, making them a safer option for those seeking natural alternatives. However, it's important to ensure that you are not allergic to any of the ingredients and to consult a healthcare professional if needed.
Healing balms and rubs offer a holistic approach to relieving aches, pains, and skin conditions. Their blend of natural ingredients can provide soothing relief, promote healing, and rejuvenate the body. Whether you're seeking relief from muscle soreness or looking for a natural remedy for minor skin issues, these products can be a valuable addition to your wellness routine.
