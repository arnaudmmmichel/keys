Our compassionate home euthanasia service is one that we have developed with a whole heart and commitment to ensuring a pet can leave this life in the comfort of a familiar environment, in the company of family (if this is desired) and without stress or pain.
Death is a part of our lives at Cherished Pets. And we’re ok with that. It is actually a part of our purpose to support pets and people through end of life.
 we provide home based guidance and care to people whose pets are in their final life phases. Whether it be a terminal illness or disorders of old age, our quality of life assessments enable us to create dedicated home-based pet care plans to ensure pets are comfortable and pain free through these final days, weeks and months. We offer home hospice pet care and help people prepare for a pet’s passing. 
Be there, with us, for them.
The past year has been particularly challenging.
In addition to dealing with the ongoing disruption caused by the COVID pandemic, 
many people and pets in our community are facing personal crises
The requests for help that we receive vary day to day. Every pet, every human and every circumstance is unique. However, 
our ground-breaking and innovative Veterinary Social Work (VSW) service
 professionally and consistently responds to the daily enquiries and requests. 
Please consider giving to our charity, Cherished Pets Foundation.

Thank you to our Cherished Pets Foundation supporters
We acknowledge the Wadawurrung People of the Kulin Nation as the traditional custodians of the land on which we are gathered and pay respects to elders past, present and emerging. We recognise their continuing connection to the land, waterways, and community and acknowledge that this land was never ceded.
As an organisation that values the human-animal bond, we endeavour to learn from, and incorporate Indigenous way of knowing and the idea of oneness into our practice, in order to benefit both the land on which we live and all beings residing upon it.

Our approach to Customer Service is reflected in our 7 C’s Core Values.
We take time to connect to our clients and patients.
Include discussion around values, circumstances, ability and levels of commitment.
Our service is kind, compassionate, without judgement, with support and understanding through all life stages.
We will only be successful in maintaining the health and wellbeing of companion pets through a shared care approach with the owner.
We rely on clear, focussed verbal communication and follow up phone calls and visits.
We use supporting materials, both hard copy and online, where necessary.
As human animal bond practitioners we are sensitive to the unique needs of our clients.
Best example of this is the need to take more time to effectively communicate to elderly people . (ie. talk slower, clearer and sometimes louder;  not to overload them with too much information; cross check for understanding and feedback; provide information in stages.
The power of pets to connect people across communities.
The role of communities to support companion pet ownership
We serve to connect and harness the resources our community provides
Cherished Pets clients become part of a growing pet loving movement in our region which provides a sense of belonging.
Through relationships and partnerships we can enhance our service experience and ensure premium care for our customers.

Our signature Veterinary Social Work service is breaking new ground and bridging a gap between animal health and human health services.
If we enable a flourishing Human Animal Bond, by keeping pets healthy, well and with their humans, it will help their humans (especially those who are experiencing vulnerability) lead healthier, happier lives, and ultimately build stronger, connected communities.
Veterinarian Alicia Kennedy is a globally recognised thought leader in the emerging field of Veterinary Social Work (VSW) which bridges a gap between human and veterinary health industries.
Over the past 7 years, Alicia and the Cherished Pets team have designed and delivered a signature community based, multi-disciplinary VSW service, embedded in a sustainable organisation model (dual-entity organisation).
As interest in this field grows, and  insights from the Cherished Pets experience have evolved, Alicia has recognised a pathway and opportunity to outreach this signature VSW service nationally.
In 2021, she was the recipient of an AMP Tomorrow Makers grant which will allow Alicia to progress the scale the Cherished Pets VSW service model and build a national platform.
In turn, we expect ongoing enhancements, innovation and opportunities to enrich the lives of pets and their people.
To embed our signature VSW approach and services across veterinary and human healthcare sectors; providing information, resources and advocacy to increase equitable access to pet care for vulnerable people, support the quality of service and wellbeing of veterinary providers, and expand awareness of the benefits of the human animal bond across the community .
That our signature VSW services are valued, funded and embedded across the veterinary and human health sectors to improve the lives of vulnerable humans who love their pets.

We recognise the importance of good dental health in overall health and wellbeing. Too many dogs and cats suffer in their mouths.  We have invested in state of the art dental equipment and radiology to allow us to offer this service to the pets in our region.
Keeping your pets healthy starts with their teeth and gums, and the regular dental check and routine scale and polish are pivotal in ensuring your pet lives a long and healthy life.
