As such, we highly recommend their civil engineering services for several reasons without hesitation. His team is responsive, knowledgeable, and professional, making them valuable assets during project management, and as overall partners in construction.  He is a consummate professional, considered by many to be an expert in the field with more than 20 years’ experience. He is well versed in providing multiple engineering solutions regardless of the size or scope of the project at hand.  Whatever is promised is delivered, and we will certainly choose them again in the future if there is ever a need.”
“Thank you for your consultancy service, the level of professionalism and efficiency at Caribbean Civil Group was refreshing. We applaud your continued efforts and look forward to working with you in the near future. Once again keep up the good work, and remain Progressive.”
Reg. Arch. 101, Intl. Assoc. AIA
“Harris Civil Engineers, LLC, is a design consultant based in Orlando. We provide civil engineering and permitting for commercial development projects. Caribbean Civil Group was our joint partner for many very large hotel resort projects throughout The Bahamas. The projects were often very difficult and involved approval, permitting, floodplain, wetland, traffic, stormwater and utility issues.
Mr. McKenzie commanded the room during meetings then, as he does today. He is very knowledgeable of the technical facets of civil engineering and the permitting requirements. We have worked with Caribbean Civil Group on many projects, including Baha Mar, West Bay Street, Corridor 7 and Royal Island. 
I highly recommend Caribbean Civil Group to you as a partner in your venture.”
