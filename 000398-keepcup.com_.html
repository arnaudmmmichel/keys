KeepCup Brew is made from durable tempered glass. Tempered glass is dishwasher safe on the top rack.  
Place small components such as plugs and silicone band in cutlery tray or basket, so they do not become damaged or lost. 
If water gets under the silicone band during washing, it can slide down the cup. For best results, use a dry band on a dry cup. 
Glass cup can be microwaved to a maximum temperature of 100 °C / 212 °F. 
Caution: Rapid temperature change or heating over 100 °C / 212 °F may cause the glass cup to shatter. Do not heat liquids in the microwave above boiling point, or place a cold cup in boiling water, or place a hot cup in cold water.

Your KeepCup cork band is made from natural material, there can be slight variances in colour, height and width of the band. As a result, band fitment will vary.
We recommend the cork band not to be removed and 
Repeated dishwashing will cause the band to become discoloured and stretched.
Place small components such as plugs in cutlery tray or basket, so they do not become damaged or lost.
Do not microwave cup with cork band on.
Place the cup on a flat surface, upside down.
Using your fingertips, gently massage the cork band upwards while rotating the glass, keeping the band at an even height.
Wash band separately and leave in the sunshine until touch dry.
Slide back onto the cup and allow to fully dry.
If your band is loosened, follow these instructions.
Place the cork band on a flat surface with the inside groove at the top.
Take the glass and place inside of the cork band.

Keep your Brew Corn and Wood good
Your KeepCup corn and wood bands are made from recovered organic materials, there can be slight variances in band complexion (texture and colour), as well as the height and width of the band. As a result, band fitment will vary.

These bands are made from compressed organic materials, so waterlogging can cause the band to change shape. If your band needs to be cleaned, wipe with a damp cloth and reassemble when dry. 
Place small components such as plugs in cutlery tray or basket, so they do not become damaged or lost.
Do not microwave cup with corn or wood band on.

KeepCup Thermal is made from double-walled, vacuum-insulated stainless steel. 
A vacuum seal sucks the air from between the twin walls, ensuring the cup is not too hot or too cold to the touch.

Freezing temperatures can damage vacuum sealed insulation, so do not place your thermal cup in the freezer.

Keep your Longplay in play for longer
KeepCup Brew Longplay is made from durable tempered glass cup with a clear plastic sleeve to create a double walled cup.  
For best thermal results, heat the glass with hot water before filling. 
Longplay will be warm to touch when filled with hot liquid, if moisture is trapped between the walls, or if the sleeve is not fitted correctly.  
For everyday use, clean with a quick rinse. Once a week, take it fully apart to remove moisture between the twin walls. Allow to dry completely before re-assembling. 
We recommend the Tritan plastic sleeve is handwashed only. Dishwashers and frequent can cloud, scuff and scratch the material.
