We want to be better for the world and strive to make a positive social, environmental and economic impact. Every time you work with us, you contribute to make this happen.
We understand our responsibility and the impact of decisions on our workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. That’s why we strive to have a triple positive impact through our actions.
We joined the largest corporate social responsibility initiative and we align our sustainability efforts to the Sustainable Development Goals established by the UN in 2015.
We committed to the Women’s Empowerment Principles. They offer us guidance on how to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the workplace, marketplace, and community. 
We pledged to recognize that climate change poses a threat to the economy, nature, and society-at-large, and to take action immediately to achieve net zero emissions before 2050.
We’re a certified Women-Owned Business. Investing in women’s economic empowerment is an opportunity to promote the sustainable development of local communities and generate long-term social and economic benefits.
We signed the commitment to adopt the Women’s Empowerment Principles, which are grounded in international labor and human rights standards and guide us on how to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace, the market, and the community. In 2020 and 2021, we were granted the WEPs Award by UN Women, ILO and, EU in Argentina.
We joined the race to zero emissions and committed to Net Zero by 2030. We offset our carbon footprint by investing in a preservation project in Jujuy (Argentina) that acts against deforestation, contributes to the conservation of native flora and fauna, and promotes the generation of local employment. We also encourage and educate our team members to be environmentally responsible.
We recognize that diversity, equity and inclusion and environmental sustainability are essential to reach full enjoyment of all human rights in our community, and are also keys to achieving sustainable development. We prioritize diverse businesses owned or operated by an individual or group that is traditionally underrepresented, and suppliers that carry out sustainable practices and use materials that do not harm the environment.
A program that offers accessible remote educational opportunities, such as webinars and workshops, aimed at providing tools to succeed in the language services sector and to improve the professional experience. We seek to impact especially areas that are more vulnerable and usually overlooked in Argentina.
