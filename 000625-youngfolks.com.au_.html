About: Our Story, Purpose & Values | Young Folks
Young Folks is a marketing agency working with brands that make a positive difference.
 marketing agency teaming up with conscious companies whose values align with our own. Innovators and disruptors. Sustainable and ethical. Community minded and kind. Most of all, just like us, they try to think in positive, practical ways. And they want everyone to know about it, so we’re helping them take their powerful messages to the world.
We're a marketing agency on a mission to make a difference.
While it would be easy to shirk responsibility and blame our capitalist society’s penchant for rampant consumerism, we know marketing has a hand in all this, too. That’s why we prefer to use our marketing and communications nous to change the world by supporting the development of purpose-led conscious companies using business as a force for good.
We know that using business as a force for good isn’t just limited to what we can do for our clients, but also what we do to prioritise people and planet (not just profit).
And that it takes more than a couple of recycling bins to be a conscious business (although that definitely helps).
. We also give five percent of our time to charities and not-for-profit organisations.
We are an inclusive organisation and a member of ACON’s 
This means we only work with conscious companies that share our values and are on a mission to make a positive difference for people and planet.
We believe that marketing is a form of activism – and as marketers, we’re using our voice to campaign for the change we want to see in the world. We’re guided by these principles into order to do great work and have a good time doing it.
Driven and conscientious, we are accountable for our behaviour, actions and impact.
We choose growth over comfort, curiosity over control, and boldly seek new challenges.
Our high spirits and passion for marketing and making an impact, makes work feel like play.
Ever inquisitive, we’re lifelong learners who seek
wisdom and create clarity from ambiguity.
We lean into creative ideas, seek creative solutions to problems, and produce creative outcomes.
		We acknowledge and pay respect to the past, present and future Traditional Custodians and Elders of the nations in which we live and work. We support the continuation of cultural, spiritual and educational practices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Young Folks operates on Woiworung, Wadawurrung, Boonwurrung and Eora lands, with business conducted across multiple other lands throughout the nation. Sovereignty has never been ceded. It always was, and always will be, Aboriginal land.

Marketing Services in Melbourne & Sydney | Young Folks
People spend hours lurking on social media. Why not use that to tap your ideal customers and get real results? You can, with the perfectly executed Facebook and Instagram Ads campaign.
Your ideal client is just out there. *gestures grandly in perfect game show host* Actually, not just your ideal client, but hundreds – maybe even thousands – of them. And you know what most of them have in common? They likely use social media every single day and each time they log in the platform is aggregating their data. And that’s something we can use to great effect with a precision targeted Facebook and Instagram Ads campaign.
Competitors’ clicks got your scratching your head? There’s an art – not exactly a dark one, but certainly one with plenty of specialised skills involved – to reaching the top spot in search results.
Here’s the reason Google Ads is an excellent way to maximise your marketing budget and grow your business… About 90 percent of people who arrive on the landing page of your website do so through a search engine. So you need to pop to the top when they enter your relevant keywords or you won’t be showing your wares to people who are ready to engage. Implementing a well-researched Google Ads campaign puts you in the lead when it comes to searches.
'But isn’t it just a collection of pretty pictures,' we hear you ask. Heck no! Pinterest is the platform with pulling power, especially when it comes to pay-per-click performance.
Pinterest is like Google, but much more fun. You can optimise content for discovery, using the same SEO principles, plus craft it with sharing and gathering followers in mind. But it’s the latest ecommerce features, like Lens, Shop from Pins and Shopping Spotlights (it highlights expert-selected content so Pinners can shop the latest trends) that is set to turn this platform into an advertising juggernaut. 
The key to engaging customers on your list is going beyond 'I hope this email finds you well' to serving up relatable content where problems are solved and promises delivered.
Whether you’re sending out a discount code, sharing your knowledge with potential clients – it’s a trust-building exercise a bit like falling backwards only fully electronic – or creating a sales funnel for a service from an opt-in there’s tonnes to consider. Get it wrong and you’ll either end up having your emails deleted before they’re opened or seeing potential business leads hitting the unsubscribe button.
We see it every day: web content so strewn with awkwardly placed keywords it’s hard to read. Balance the equation so you get great search results and cut the copy cringe.
When someone gets it in their head to find something – and that can be anything from a water fountain for their cat to a new superannuation fund that invests in renewable energy – they are heading straight to Google. How likely? About 90 percent. Every day, that leads to about 5.6 billion Google Searches. But most don’t even make it past the first page. Some will only look at the top four or five results. That means if your brand isn’t ranking highly for relevant keywords and search terms (read: nailing your SEO), no one new is finding you.
There are many keys to success, but amping up your brand's social media presence with content that connects and converts can open doors you never knew existed.
They started out as a way to keep up with what your friends were doing, but social media platforms from Facebook to LinkedIn, Instagram to TikTok, are now used by savvy businesses to get in front of a whole world of potential new clients and re-engage those they’ve dealt with in the past.
Designed from the ground up, your social media strategy should authentically represent your brand, be executed in a meticulous fashion then tweaked to reflect data as it becomes available.
There’s no single way to get your target audience to turn to your business. They’re everywhere and you need a smart, focused multi-channel marketing strategy to capture attention. 
Lean in close because we’ve got something we need to tell you and it’s really important. *whispers* The key to success when you’re looking to grow your business and brand sustainably is getting a rock-solid multi-channel marketing strategy in place.
Some people think it’s all about bells, whistles, PR stunts, expensive advertising campaigns and dropping leaflets from planes (OK, perhaps not that last one so much). But if you don’t have a strategy in place, the result is kinda like a shooting star – it burns bright then disappears.

Email Marketing Agency: High Performance Campaigns | Young Folks
Unlock the power of the inbox.
Do you know how prevalent email is in the world? At last count, about 4 billion people use it. Want another big number? About 3 million emails are sent every second. But while those figures are mind-boggling, this is also a popularity contest and email wins Miss Congeniality every time with about 95 per cent of people checking their accounts every day.
Here’s the rub though: an average customer probably gets about 100 emails every day, so you have to stand out or risk being sifted out. A great offer is the perfect start, since 60 per cent of consumers have made a purchase after receiving a promotional email. There is no business that can’t benefit from a well-designed and executed digital marketing plan, and the team at Young Folks can help you leverage your list from your first marketing email.
Whether you’re sending out a discount code, sharing your knowledge with potential clients – it’s a trust-building exercise, a bit like falling backwards, only fully electronic – or creating a sales funnel for a service from an opt-in, there’s tonnes to consider. Get it wrong and you’ll either end up having your emails deleted before they’re opened or seeing potential business leads hitting the unsubscribe button.
It’s about building both relationships and profits. You can use email to boost brand awareness, promote content on your website or launch a new product or service. You can create an automated series that welcomes new subscribers to your list, sends them a reminder when they abandon their cart or creates a follow-up when they’ve bought something from you. Best of all, you can use it to approach your customers in a way that is completely on brand and helps them achieve their goals.
We've designed and built email marketing campaigns for the best.
		Our email marketing specialists have developed and implemented results-driven email marketing campaigns for trusted ethical and sustainable companies. Whether it’s email automation, a comprehensive subscriber acquisition and nurture strategy, or email template design and development, we’ve been there and done that.
					How we put your email marketing on blast			
Attract the eyeballs of people ready to convert from browser to buyer.
We get together for a chat to determine your vision and objectives. During the session, we’ll gather everything we need to create a brief for your email marketing strategy. Think subscriber segments, lead acquisition, campaign emails and automation to boot.
This is the research phase, where we’ll be delving into your email marketing analytics (if they’re available) and any other data we can lay our hands on to build a clear picture of what’s working and where the opportunities lie.
Next up, we’ll dive into developing your email marketing strategy by pulling together content pillars, audiences, segments, key messages and how they’ll be activated within your email marketing. Once that’s done, we’ll organise a video call to walk you through the strategy and ensure the team is comfortable with the approach, recommendations and nuances.
The best bit? Our content specialists set about designing creative yet data-informed email templates that are made to drive clicks (and conversions).
We’ll work through any implementation questions you have or handle the implementation for you. Then, of course, we’ll analyse the data to understand your key customers, when they’re opening the emails, what they’re clicking through to read, and – heavens no – what makes them unsubscribe.
					Frequently asked questions (and all of the answers)			
Because if you know you know. And if you don't you ask.
		What email marketing platforms do you work with?	
Our email marketing specialists are highly experienced with 
. MailChimp is a fantastic platform to get started with your email marketing. When you have more sophisticated email marketing and marketing automation requirements, we recommend levelling up with Active Campaign or Klaviyo.
		How much does email marketing cost?	
Unlike digital advertising, email marketing isn't pay to play. But there are still some costs involved with running email marketing campaigns. You'll need to pay for an email marketing platform which usually attracts a monthly fee based on the number of subscribers you have and the level of functionality required. You'll also need to invest in some email marketing templates (that is the designs of the EDMs you'll send) and the strategy and management of your email marketing campaigns. When you work with us, we'll start out by creating an email marketing strategy and then move into email scripting and template development. In order to be effective, and appropriately manage your expectations, we recommend allowing for around $1,000 per month as a starting point for email marketing.
		How many subscribers should I have for email marketing to be successful?	
Like all marketing, it's not about the size of your audience but rather how engaged the audience is. If you have a small email list, we can work with you to design a subscriber acquisition campaign designed to get more of the right people on your list with an irresistible lead magnet and marketing campaign. And if you have a large email list we can work with you to appropriately segment and tag your audience in order to elevate performance with personalised email marketing.
Whatever your objective: conversions, leads, awareness, or traffic – there are no guarantees when it comes to results. And anyone who tells you there is, is not telling the whole truth. 
Email marketing, like any marketing activity, is influenced by a myriad of factors. 
It would be irresponsible for us to guarantee you something that is heavily influenced by external factors – many of which are beyond the scope of work we provide and out of our control (ahem: global pandemics, changing privacy rules, Apple limiting tracking, and even your website not being properly optimised or it crashing). 
Our team will stay abreast of the latest practices and make optimisations and recommendations in order to achieve better results within your email campaign. And if things aren't working, we'll tell you – because we'd rather see your marketing succeed overall than desperately cling onto a channel or activity that isn't working.
		How do you ensure your reporting and results are transparent?	
We’ll be transparent in our reporting, always. How? We'll provide you with real-time data and results through a Google Data Studio Dashboard tailored specifically for you – and available for you to look at at any hour of the day. We'll then send you a weekly performance update via email, covering off any important points. Then, monthly we'll deliver you your monthly report, that we'll then cover off in a 1-hour meeting.
During our check-ins, we'll take you through your reports which includes actions taken, results achieved, insights generated, and recommended actions. At the three month mark, we'll send a three-month review report and then jump on a call – the perfect time to see where we've been together, and where we're going next.
		What are your email marketing management agreement terms?	
As a general rule, after completing an email marketing strategy and campaign plan, it takes around 12 weeks to move through the launch and learn process into optimising and scaling your email marketing performance. With this in mind, we ask for an initial four month commitment in order to give our email marketing specialists time to work through our proven process and determine what works for your brand. We run our email marketing campaign management services on a retainer basis with a four month initial commitment on a 12 month agreement. For example, with an email marketing service, typically, we’d spend the first month on the strategy for your service (where we build the plan). We’d then move into the management of your email marketing campaigns for three months (where the strategy comes to life, we launch the emails, and we spend time testing and continuously optimising). After this four month commitment is up, we then ask you to give us 30 days’ notice if you wish to exit the agreement at any time before the 12 months is up.
		Do I own my email campaigns and IP?	
When you work with us we grant you the licence to use our IP – aka our secret sauce, our experience, our ideas and our strategies. This works in a similar way to music licences where the artist can licence the use of a track, but the user does not own it. Essentially we give you permission to use our thinking and strategies but not permission to on-sell them or allow another third-party to utilise them. As for physical outcomes, such as email marketing design templates and copywriting for email scripts, these are yours to own upon receipt of payment.
		How long does it take to get results?	
We recommend allowing around 12 weeks to reach optimum email marketing performance. However the timeline can vary depending on how many emails you are sending and the size of your database. As a guide, our first four weeks are what we like to call the 'launch and learn' phase where our team will be working through a whole bunch of data-informed marketing hypothesis. From there, we take our learnings and move into the optimise and scale phase in weeks 5-12 where we ideally hit the sweet spot where we can maintain or seriously start to scale performance with increased investment.
		Thanks for the report – they're awesome results given it's only been a few days. A few of our staff noticed the new ads and have commented on how engaging and schmick they are – thanks!	
		I just wanted to drop you a quick note to say I’ve had a look through and it looks aaamaaaazzzing. Thanks as always for your fantastic work – lots to think about and digest. 	
		I truly cannot thank you both enough. I don’t know what we would have done without you.

Facebook Ads Agency: Campaigns & Creative | Young Folks
Stop the Scroll with Facebook Ads.
If you were to hazard a guess at how many active Facebook accounts were out there, what would you say? Would it surprise you that there are 2.85 billion Facebook accounts that are active every month? Narrow it down further and there are 1.88 billion accounts people use every single day.
Add to that 1 billion monthly Instagram users and you’ve got quite the pool – well, less pool and more ocean – of potential new clients. You’d have to be just a little bit naïve to think your business couldn’t benefit from a little glow-up thanks to Facebook Ads. Thankfully, we’re here to help you make the most of it.
 shaking things up, data aggregation on social media platforms is becoming more sophisticated all the time, which allows you (and us) to focus your Facebook Ads with laser-like precision, using basic demographics like age and location, but also tapping into the real money makers like people’s personal interests and browsing behaviours.
Why fuss around with maybe customers when you can target the ones who matter most? Improve the quality of your leads, increase conversion rates and get your brand in front of engaged eyeballs. All with a strategically designed Facebook Ads campaign.
We've created foolproof Facebook Ads plans for leading conscious companies.
		Our Facebook Ads specialists have developed and implemented results-driven campaigns for trusted ethical and sustainable companies. From audience research to competitive analysis, strategy development to creative production, our team designs campaigns to maximise performance marketing results.
Ready to foolproof your Facebook Ads?
					How we make the most of your Facebook Ads budget			
Attract the eyeballs of people ready to convert from browser to buyer.
We get together to talk turkey about your business requirements because we need to know about your offering, how it’s unique and what opportunities you see to build brand awareness, traffic and loyalty prior to developing a Facebook and Instagram strategy. 
02 Getting to the heart of it
The next step is all about us getting an insight into your ideal clients and checking out what your competitors are doing across Facebook and Instagram. Considering the size of the opportunity and nature of the competition allows us to tailor your strategy according to what’s already working, and make adjustments to give you the advantage.
Facebook and Instagram advertising is all about targeting the right audience at the right stage of their journey to purchase. We’ll tailor a digital advertising strategy that brings together your commercial objectives and the customer journey to purchase – right message, right time, every time.
No strategy is complete without reporting. We’ll measure the effectiveness of Facebook and Instagram advertising campaigns by reviewing ROA and ROI across each placement, the different pieces of creative and the audience. Armed with that data, we’ll make necessary adjustments to the strategy and implementation to continually improve performance.
Around a month after launching we’ve got some serious data in your Facebook Ads Manager account to dig through. We dive into the numbers and use these insights to shape optimisations designed to create new conversion-optimised creative and enhance performance.
					Frequently asked questions (and all of the answers)			
Because if you know you know. And if you don't you ask.
Facebook and Instagram collect data from users on the platforms – from types of content consumed to interests and behaviours, even websites engaged with (if the Facebook Pixel is in place). This data can then be used by advertisers as means to reach audiences and achieve marketing objectives.
		How much do Facebook Ads cost?	
Like any digital advertising campaign, Facebook Ads are charged on a cost-per-click (CPC) or cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) basis. 
When you choose to invest marketing budget in Facebook and Instagram Ads, the cost of running ads is made up of advertising spend (on the Facebook platform) and strategy, set-up, and campaign management – and, if needed, creative production. 
In order for a Facebook Ads campaign to be effective, and appropriately set your expectations, we recommend allowing for a minimum of $2,500 plus GST per month investment including management and advertising platform costs. We’ll provide a transparent quote, tailored to your needs, that shows exactly what you’re getting and how we’re going to do it. Not sure if you're ready to outsource Facebook Ads management? Read our blog with 17 questions to ask before 
		How much do I need to spend on Facebook advertising each month?	
We recommend getting started with an ad spend of $1,000 per month for Facebook and Instagram Ads. This is so that our specialists have enough budget to rapidly test, learn and optimise and determine what works (so we can hit that sweet spot). We can work with smaller budgets but the speed in which we get results will be throttled. Facebook Ads budgets can be scaled up and down as necessary in relation to your advertising objectives – for example: if your ROAS (that's return on ad spend) is above expectations, we may recommend to increase ad spend to achieve even more sales.
Whatever your objective: conversions, leads, awareness, or traffic – there are no guarantees when it comes to results. And anyone who tells you there is, is not telling the whole truth. 
Facebook and Instagram Ads, like any marketing activity, is influenced by a myriad of factors. 
It would be irresponsible for us to guarantee you something that is heavily influenced by external factors – many of which are beyond the scope of work we provide and out of our control (ahem: global pandemics, Facebook changing their platform rules, Apple limiting tracking, and even your website not being properly optimised or it crashing). 
Our team will stay abreast of the latest practices and make optimisations and recommendations in order to achieve better results within your campaign. And if things aren't working, we'll tell you – because we'd rather see your marketing succeed overall than desperately cling onto a channel or activity that isn't working.

This works in a similar way to music licences where the artist can licence the use of a track, but the user does not own it. Essentially we give you permission to use our thinking and strategies but not permission to on-sell them or allow another third-party to utilise them. As for physical outcomes such as Facebook Ads creative, including copywriting and creation of visual assets, these are yours to own upon receipt of payment.
		Can I just boost a post?	
Look. You can. But we don't recommend it. While boosting does allow you to reach a wider audience, it doesn't give you anywhere near the amount of precision targeting or control over performance that strategic Facebook Ads campaign configured via Facebook Ads manager does.
		How long does it take to get results?	
We recommend allowing around 12 weeks to reach optimum performance. As a guide, our first four weeks are what we like to call the 'launch and learn' phase where our team will be working through a whole bunch of data-informed marketing hypothesis.

Google Ads Agency: PPC Management | Young Folks
Boost leads and sales with a PPC campaign.
These are the fast facts: there are about 5.6 billion Google Searches every day. Of those, 95.3 percent of clicks go to the top four results. Let that sink in – no one is scrolling through pages of Google Search listings. Hardly anyone is even scrolling to the bottom of page one. Using a carefully considered strategy and experienced campaign management, we’ll use Google Ads to raise your online profile and drive highly motivated leads to your website.
And because Google Ads works on a pay-per-click model, your budget never goes to waste. You only pay for the attention you get from potential customers who are looking for exactly what you offer. If you want to skyrocket your ROI then Google Ads is one of the fastest ways to get there.
While it’s true you can organically improve your ranking on Google Search using SEO, some of us ain’t got time for that. As a growing business, you need to stake a claim on all your relevant keywords so potential customers can find you straight away. A strategic Google Ads campaign is a fast and cost-effective way to bring all the buyers to your yard (and by yard we mean website.)
We've managed Google Ads campaigns for world-leading responsible brands.
		Our Google Ads specialists have developed and implemented results-driven campaigns for trusted ethical and sustainable companies. Whether it's search ads, product shopping ads, or display, we'll find the right combination of digital advertising for prospecting and retargeting to deliver performance marketing results.

We get together to talk about you: your business, your offering, what you need and the opportunities available to build brand awareness, increase traffic and drive conversions prior to developing and implementing the Google Ads campaign strategy. Because there’s no better time to start getting noticed than right now.
We conduct comprehensive keyword research and analyse your competitors to understand how your brand sits in the search engine landscape. Considering the size of the opportunity and nature of the competition allows us to tailor a strategy to maximise your traffic acquisition, drive qualified leads and increase conversions at an efficient cost-per-click.
We establish a comprehensive Google Ads strategy tailored specifically to your brand and designed to deliver sustainable growth of web traffic that delivers results. Put simply, it’s a plan to attract more of your target audience so you can increase your sales or conversions.
When we implement your Google Ads strategy it’s all about account structure, bid adjustment, search term analysis and ad copy optimisation. Of course, there’s also reporting because you need to see the difference and growth all this Google Ads activity has made.
Around a month after launching we’ve got some serious data to dig through. We dive into the numbers and use these insights to shape Google Ads account optimisations designed to improve performance and grow results.
					Frequently asked questions (and all of the answers)			
Because if you know, you know. And if you don't you ask.
		How much do Google Ads cost?	
The total cost of your investment would be made up of strategy, management and campaign setup fees – and, if needed, creative production. We’ll provide a transparent quote, tailored to your needs, that shows exactly what you’re getting and how we’re going to do it.
In order to be effective, and to appropriately set your expectations, you will need to allow for a minimum of $1,500 plus GST per month investment not including ad spend.
		How much should I budget for Google Ads per month?	
We recommend getting started with an ad spend of $1,000 (per month, per channel). This is so that our specialists have enough budget to rapidly test, learn and optimise in order to quickly get to the sweet spot. We can work with smaller budgets but the speed in which we get results will be throttled. We can scale this up/down as necessary (usually we start to see what is happening with the ROAS), ie. we would let you know when we need to spend more, to make you more! Unsure how to go about outsourcing your Google Ad management? Read our blog 
How to Hire a Google Ads Expert
 that includes 11 questions you need to ask before hiring someone to manage your Google Ads.
There are no guarantees with ROAS and anyone who tells you there is, is not telling the whole truth. It would be irresponsible for us to guarantee you something that is heavily influenced by external factors – many of which are beyond the scope of work we provide and out of our control (ahem: global pandemics, Facebook changing their platform rules and even your website not being properly optimised or it crashing). The team will stay abreast of the latest practices and optimisations in order to best position your business to attract better ROAS.
		How do you ensure your reporting and results are transparent?	
We’ll be transparent in our reporting, always. How? We'll provide you with real-time data and results through a Google Data Studio Dashboard tailored specifically for you – and available for you to look at at any hour of the day. We'll then send you a weekly performance update via email, covering off any important points. Then, monthly we'll deliver you your monthly report, which we'll then cover off in a 1-hour meeting.
During our check-ins, we'll take you through your reports which includes actions taken, results achieved, insights generated, and recommended actions. At the three month mark, we'll send a three-month review report and then jump on a call – the perfect time to see where we've been together, and where we're going next.
		What are your Google Ads management agreement terms? 	
For one-off projects, the agreement lasts for the length of the agreed project. For all our retained services we ask for an initial four month commitment on a 12 month agreement. For example, with a Facebook Ads service, typically, we’d spend the first month on the strategy for your service (where we build the plan). We’d then move into the management of your service for three months (where the strategy comes to life, we turn the ads on and we spend time testing and continuously optimising). After this four month commitment is up, we then ask you to give us 30 days’ notice if you wish to exit the agreement at any time before the 12 months is up.
		Do I own my ads, campaigns and IP? 	
When you work with us we grant you the licence to use our IP – aka our secret sauce, our experience, our ideas and our strategies. This works in a similar way to music licences where the artist can licence the use of a track, but the user does not own it. Essentially we give you permission to use our thinking and strategies but not permission to on-sell them or allow another third party to utilise them. As for physical outcomes such as writing content, ad creative, newsletter content, etc. these are yours to own upon receipt of payment.
		Thanks for the report – they're awesome results given it's only been a few days. A few of our staff noticed the new ads and have commented on how engaging and schmick they are – thanks!	
		I just wanted to drop you a quick note to say I’ve had a look through and it looks aaamaaaazzzing. Thanks as always for your fantastic work – lots to think about and digest. 	
		I truly cannot thank you both enough. I don’t know what we would have done without you.

Marketing Strategy Consultants | Young Folks
Map out a plan to get their eyes on your prize.
Many business owners and their team members are already stretched thin when it comes to time and resources. You’re dealing with clients and customers. Perhaps you’re overseeing manufacturing. Maybe you’re attempting to launch new products. Thinking about all the aspects of a marketing program you could or should add to the mix – social media platforms, email funnels, ad campaigns – can cause head spins.
It could be you’ve implemented a marketing strategy and sales have stagnated or your warm leads have turned to ice, ice, baby. You need to consult an expert because you’ve got a problem. It could be you’re not articulating your brand story or the wrong audience is picking up what you’re putting down. 
Whatever your business, whether you’re selling products or solutions, you need a marketing strategy that’s been developed just for you – one that takes into account every aspect of your brand’s personality, as well as what you’re trying to achieve – to help you rise out of the mosh pit of competitors and crowd surf the wave of success.
It’s time to share your products and services to the world, but there are so many avenues to consider. You need to have clarity with your message and feel confident that any investment you make will come back to you multiplied. That’s why we also sort out the strategy before implementing any marketing campaign. Doing anything else is like walking up to the starting blocks before you’ve tied the laces of your running shoes. 
We've developed multi-channel marketing strategies for world-leading responsible brands.
		Our marketing specialists have developed multi-channel marketing strategies spanning digital advertising and content marketing for leading ethical and sustainable brands. Our experience spans ecommerce, travel, professional services, building and construction, ecommerce and FMCG.	
Ready to meet your marketing strategists?
					How we make the marketing magic happen			
It's simple. And it's complex. And we love it.
We’ll meet up to hammer out the details of your business requirements. We take time to understand your unique offering and the opportunity to achieve your strategic objectives and KPIs prior to developing the marketing strategy and activity plan.
Before creating a marketing strategy tailored to your brand or product, we begin to analyse what makes your brand unique. Who are you? What’s your mission and purpose? What are you trying to say? And who are you saying it to? 
After familiarising ourselves with the heart and soul of your brand, we begin to research exactly who your target audience is. We examine their interests, what resonates with them in terms of storytelling, and the best channels for you to deliver your marketing messages. 
With the research and analysis behind us, it’s time to dive into strategy development. This means stitching together your goals and objectives with your values and story and figuring out how to connect with your ideal customer in the channels they consume media. It’s as simple and as complicated as that.
The only thing worse than a rubbish strategy is a brilliant strategy that never gets implemented. When you work with us, your strategy deck won’t ever collect dust because we’ll walk you through a handover process. We even offer optional mentoring, so you can implement with confidence.
					Frequently asked questions (and all of the answers)			
Because if you know, you know. And if you don't you ask.
		How long does a marketing strategy take to complete?	
Four weeks! Yep – you heard that right. Upon signing, we’ll detail a timeline of when your kickoff call will take place when your marketing strategy will be presented via a handover call and then delivered to your inbox.
		What can I expect from the marketing strategy? What’s included?	
As a guide, our marketing strategy documents are typically between 70-90 pages and include:
Audience research and identification (who we’re talking to).
Marketing channel research and recommendation (where we’re talking to them).
Content pillars and key messages (what we’re saying).
A detailed plan on how to leverage each channel – i.e. our SEO recommendation includes a website content structure, our social recommendation includes an example content plan for a week (how we’re saying it).
We’d then support this with appendix documents such as the keyword research for SEO and any details around audience research and insights.
The document is designed to be implemented, so each section comes with clear instructions on how to use the channel and why it matters, too.
		Who do you recommend to implement the marketing strategy?	
There are a few ways that other brands do this – and it is totally dependent on you.
In our experience, it’s different for each brand and depends on their strategy and the parts of their marketing strategy that can (or cannot) be actioned in-house by a marketing team.
Typically, we would see clients implement parts of the marketing strategy that is in line with the generalised skillset of their marketing manager or coordinator – then utilising the expertise of an agency, such as Young Folks, to execute the more analytical and technical elements of the strategy.
With the generalised marketing on lock in-house, Young Folks could execute SEO, digital advertising, and email marketing on an ongoing basis. And content creation on a needs basis.

Stick a pin in untapped sources.
There are about 200 million small businesses on Facebook, each of them waving their digital arms frantically trying to get the attention of new clients. It can be hard to stand out in such a crowded field. So why not divert at least part of your marketing budget to the platform 80 percent of users describe as ‘an online oasis’?
Pinterest is a search engine and a social media platform that gives you the opportunity to optimise pins with keywords, hashtags and even schema to reach new audiences, drive traffic and conversions. Plus, there are a number of different algorithms at play for the ‘For You’ feed and the ‘Today’ news feed. 
For ecommerce, it offers incredible functionality. Lens allows users to point their smartphone camera at a real-life item and browse similar Pins and products. Shopping functionality lets them tap a Pin and see what they can buy from the photo. For example, tap a dreamy bathroom and you could soon be buying the towels, vanity and tapware in the image.
And if you’re sitting there thinking, “Yeah, but isn’t Instagram the gold standard when it comes to visual social media platforms,” here’s a juicy little fact that might make you change your tune. The number of users engaging with shopping surfaces on Pinterest has grown by more than 200 per cent to March this year, with research showing people who visit Pinterest monthly spend twice as much as non-Pinners every month and have a 40 per cent larger basket size. Plus, Pinterest tends to have a lower average CPC than either Facebook or Instagram. All in all, you might say it’s a pin-pin situation.
We've managed Pinterest Ads campaigns for world-leading responsible brands.
		Our Pinterest Ads specialists have developed and implemented results-driven campaigns for trusted ethical and sustainable companies. Whether it's dynamic product ads, video ads, or retargeting, we'll find the right combination of digital advertising for prospecting and retargeting to deliver performance marketing results.

Attract the eyeballs of people ready to convert from browser to buyer.
We get together to talk about you: your business, your offering, what you need and how you can begin to grow followers on your Pinterest account while we get busy coming up with a marketing strategy. It’s time people started noticing you.
We analyse your competitors to understand how your brand sits in the Pinterest landscape, and how you can build brand awareness while driving sales and increasing conversion. We also do research into the audience so we can tailor a strategy that will bring you new customers at different stages of your acquisition funnel.
We establish a comprehensive Pinterest strategy tailored specifically to your brand and designed to deliver traffic to your website and convert them into leads and sales. Put simply, it’s a three-month plan to attract more of your target audience so you can bring home the bacon.
We implement your Pinterest business strategy, including creating your ads, and track its progress, making adjustments to search terms, targeting, bids and copy to ensure they’re all performing at an optimum. Of course, there’s also reporting because transparency is everything – you need to see the difference and growth that comes from your Pinterest business account.
About a month after launching we’ve got some serious data in your Pinterest Ads Manager account to dig through. We dive into the numbers and use these insights to shape optimisations designed to create new conversion-optimised creative and enhance performance.

SEO Agency: Copywriting & Management | Young Folks
Rise up online rankings with great content.
Whatever stage of the buying journey they’ve reached, your potential customers are likely to come to you through a search engine. Trouble is, if you haven’t implemented SEO correctly chances are you’re not going to sit in the top four to five results. That’s where the hungry fish swim and, because more traffic makes a huge difference, it’s where you need to be if you want to land them.
It used to be that companies could just load up a piece of content with keywords and phrases, whack it on their website, rinse and repeat. What that did – and still occasionally does – is get people to your site under what are almost false pretences. They click, cringe at what they’re reading and go back to their search.
You want people to be able to find you but you also want them to become converts to your cause. Good SEO-optimised copy can do both. It can bring potential customers to you and it can show them how you can solve a problem they have or make their life better in some way.
For those not working in the digital space there are traps that can send your results plummeting. Google algorithms change regularly and you need to be on top of them to stay ahead. Delivering an enjoyable user experience is also a key strategy – you want people to fall in love with your business once they’ve found you. That’s where we excel: driving traffic to your website and showing potential customers your business is one they can feel happy to support.
We've developed and implemented SEO strategies for leading brands.
		Our SEO specialists have developed and implemented results-driven SEO campaigns for trusted ethical and sustainable companies. We start with an SEO audit, dive deep into keyword research, build out an SEO content strategy and wrap up with compelling copywriting that search engines love to rank (and humans love to read).

Attract the eyeballs of people ready to convert from browser to buyer.
We meet with you to discuss your business requirements in detail. We take time to understand your unique offering and look at ways to increase website traffic prior to developing and implementing the strategy.
We jump on our SEO tools to conduct a comprehensive website audit leaving no stone unturned. We comb through your website content, dig into technical SEO and analyse backlinks to determine what’s working and what requires optimisation.
03 Keyword research and competitor analysis
We conduct comprehensive keyword research and competitor analysis to understand the search landscape for your brand. Understanding the size of the opportunity and nature of the competition allows us to tailor your strategy according to what’s already working, and make adjustments to give you the advantage.
We develop an SEO strategy that’s tailored specifically to your brand and designed to deliver sustainable growth of high quality traffic. In other words, we’re bringing you more of your target audience so you’ll see increased sales and conversions. 
When we implement your SEO strategy we never lose sight of the main game, and constantly look at technical improvements, content writing and optimisation, backlink development, and social media engagement. Of course, it’s important to report back to you regularly to demonstrate the difference all this search engine optimisation work has made.

Scroll-stopping social media strategy and content.
If only it was as simple as finding some cool pics, writing a quirky caption and waiting for the likes to roll in. For a start, although they’re a great ego boost, likes aren’t what we’re after. We want engagement, conversation, community and customers. You can use these platforms to tell your brand’s story, to launch a product, to expand your client base, and to offer people who are already fans of your brand a little insight and inspiration.
If you’ve got the time, you can do it organically, or you can explore a paid social campaign. All social media platforms have an advertising platform, and each one boasts incredible results. Instagram, as an example, reports that 75 percent of its users take action on ads.
You know the phrase “pics or it didn’t happen”? With the prevalence of social media use rising all the time – in January 2021 about 80 per cent of Australians were active users, up from 58 per cent in 2015 – that has never been more true. If you’re not executing a fully formed social media strategy for your brand, it’s fair to say you probably aren’t capturing the attention of people who could become your most valued clients.
Whether you’ve dipped your toes in the water and realise it’s a much more technical and time-consuming task than your team can handle or you’re ready to launch a new campaign, we can help with powerful content creation – from eye-catching visuals to compelling copy – scheduling, cross-platform promotion, reaching your target audience, analysing the data and reporting it.
We've managed social media campaigns for world-leading responsible brands.
		Our social media marketing specialists have developed and implemented engaging and high performing content marketing strategies for trusted ethical and sustainable companies. Think Instagram content (sans cringe-worthy Reels), keyword-optimised Pinterest content, and LinkedIn content that attracts leads not recruiters.

					How we grow community and conversions			
Attract the eyeballs of people ready to convert from browser to buyer.
We’ll meet with you to discuss what your requirements are and the results you hope to achieve. We need to know all this and understand your unique offering, so we can achieve your objectives and meet KPIs. We can also suggest ways to start growing your social media profile while we work on your strategy.
Before we can work on the strategy we first have to define what makes your brand unique. What makes it tick? What’s your mission? Who are you talking to? And what is it you’re trying to say? 
While we’re digging deep into your brand values, we’ll be researching your target audience and how to best reach them. We’ll examine their interests, how they look for information, how storytelling resonates for them and how best to reach them.
Now that we know all about you and your audience, we jump right in to establishing a strategy. It brings together your values, story, goals and objectives then uses a number of social media platforms to connect to your ideal consumer. It’s both simple and complex.
When we implement your social media strategy we never lose sight of the main game, and constantly review engagement metrics to make data-informed optimisations. And we’ll report back to you regularly to demonstrate the difference all this social media marketing has made.
