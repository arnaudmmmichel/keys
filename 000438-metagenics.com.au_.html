Helping Make Your Clinic A Leader in Natural Medicine
As part of Health World’s exceptional facilities at Northgate, Brisbane, we have a purpose built research clinic. 
The research clinic provides an opportunity for the latest research findings to be applied directly to clinical practice. This enables Health World to create cutting-edge, clinically proven treatment protocols for complex conditions.
The clinic also provides Health World with valuable clinical tips to pass on to our Practitioners, including the best ways to manage patient compliance and the best treatment strategies to apply for optimal clinical outcomes.
The research clinic is equipped with the leading point of care testing devices and equipment including:
Bioimpedance Analysis for monitoring body composition and cellular health.
Diagnostic testing unit for immediate lipid inflammatory parameter and liver enzyme results.
Assessment and management of stress related conditions.
Holistic management of children – allergies, autism and ADHD.
Health World’s clinic continues to address important clinical issues, using the latest in natural therapies to further develop complementary medicine practices.
The first clinic program ran from October to December 2005, working with 15 patients with metabolic syndrome to maintain healthy cholesterol, weight, body composition, blood pressure and blood sugar. 
The participants were first comprehensively assessed, determining fasting cholesterol fractions, fasting triglycerides, liver enzymes, blood pressure, body composition, cellular health and two hour oral glucose tolerance.
After their initial consultations, participants were given a 10 week program including nutritional and herbal supplementation, dietary guidelines and lifestyle advice. Each patient had regular appointments to monitor progress with their allocated Practitioner, a Naturopath within the Health World technical department.
At the end of the treatment period, patients were assessed again with the same testing procedures to record any changes. Across the group of participants, many benefits of the therapy were observed. Most participants had significant beneficial changes in cholesterol and triglycerides. Weight loss was a common result and waist circumference was reduced, indicating a reduction in abdominal obesity. Improvements in glucose tolerance and insulin concentrations were also noted. Hypertensive patients responded well to the program, with significant therapeutic reductions in blood pressure. 
A participant survey revealed excellent patient satisfaction with the program, finding it effective, educational and motivating.
“A wonderful program, which I will try to keep up!” – Clinic participant, 67 years of age.
The success of Health World’s clinic will continue to address important clinical issues, using the latest natural therapies to further the development of complementary practices.

meta description:N/A

Why Natural Medicine | Metagenics - 
Natural Healthcare Practitioners aim to have their patients feeling better as quickly as possible, whilst preventing the recurrence of future illness. To do this, Practitioners treat the underlying cause of conditions, rather than focusing on the symptoms. 
For this reason, Practitioners are likely to prescribe dietary and lifestyle changes in conjunction with Natural Medicines, to provide long-term support for their patients. 
Why Metagenics Products Are So Highly Regarded
By prescribing the Metagenics range, Practitioners are recommending high quality, clinically effective products. Metagenics is proudly a Practitioner only brand, formulated to meet the highest standards of quality and safety.  
This is why Metagenics is the number one provider of Natural Medicine throughout Australia and New Zealand.
Metagenics are continually innovating new and existing products and protocols, to provide Practitioners with the latest in scientific research.
For example, Metagenics was the first company in Australia to offer therapeutic strength acidophilus featuring the NCFM
, one of the most highly researched and scientifically validated strains in the world.
Metagenics proudly funds research studies at several universities throughout the world and employs over 20 Doctors, Naturopaths and Research Scientists to find new and improved ways to support patients on their journey to better health.
The effectiveness of a Natural Medicine is directly proportional to the quality and strength of its raw materials. Metagenics only uses ingredients that have passed strict quality control testing like microbiological analysis, assay tests and identification of the correct materials to ensure they meet pharmaceutical grade quality and purity standards.
Metagenics ANZ head office, located in Brisbane Queensland, is home to a $40 million purpose-built manufacturing and testing facility. This state-of-the-art investment is a TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) and GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) approved site, allowing the continual growth and development of Natural Medicine by Metagenics.
The manufacturing processes adopted by Metagenics avoid the use of excess heat, moisture and compaction, which can reduce the biological activity of many nutrients and herbs. Metagenics uses only natural non-reactive vegetable gums and cellulose, whilst strictly avoiding common reactive binders, fillers and synthetic additives which can cause adverse reactions and side effects.
Storage of raw materials and finished product is also of vital importance, as many Natural Medicines are damaged or destroyed by temperatures above 25°C. This is why all Metagenics' production and warehouse facilities are either air-conditioned or refrigerated, ensuring the customer receives a high quality, finished product.
If you've invested in the commitment to better health through a Natural Healthcare Practitioner, you want to see results. This is why your Practitioner prescribes Metagenics- for quality, safety and efficacy. Your health and their practice depends on it.

meta title:Detox | Metagenics - 
meta description:N/A

Congratulations on Making the Commitment to Better Health and Vitality
With support and guidance from your Practitioner, following a detoxification program can be an effective strategy for improving the state of your health.
Detoxification is a natural metabolic process whereby the environmental and dietary toxins we are exposed to are changed into less harmful substances, and subsequently excreted from the body. The Metagenics Clinical Detoxification Programs aim to address dietary and lifestyle factors to reduce the burden placed on your detoxification system, while simultaneously supporting the capacity of your key detox organs. The ultimate goal of a professional detoxification program is to provide you with a personalised protocol that is safe and effective, and enables you to achieve the best possible health.
There are three Metagenics Clinical Detoxication Programs – the Health Reset Program, Gut Pathogen Elimination Program and Liver Chemical Clearance Program. Your Practitioner will recommend the program that is most suited to your health needs and will tailor your detoxification so that you can achieve the best possible results. Throughout the chosen program, your Practitioner will prescribe nutritional and herbal formulas with dietary and lifestyle guidelines to support and enhance your detoxification processes. Your individual product prescription and the duration of treatment will vary depending on which program is appropriate; however dietary and lifestyle guidelines remain consistent for all the detox programs.
Your Practitioner will select one of the following detoxification programs, tailored to your individual health needs:
 is suitable for most individuals. It helps to optimise your detoxification capacity, supporting your overall health, and keeping you feeling energised.
 is indicated for people with persistent gut conditions, helping to reduce digestive symptoms such as pain, bloating and wind for a happier digestive system.
 is ideal for those with known exposure to chemicals and heavy metals. It enhances the elimination of these toxins to leave you feeling regenerated and vibrant.
 Detoxification should not be attempted during pregnancy. If you fall pregnant while doing a detox you should stop the program and contact your Practitioner. However, if you are planning to conceive, it is a very good idea for both partners to detoxify before pregnancy. Eggs and sperm take three to four months to develop, so you should aim to have completed your detox at least four months prior to conception.
 Many prescription medications can be affected by the detoxification process. However, it is unusual that you will need to alter the dosage of the medication you are taking; you may just need to separate the doses away from your detox supplements. Your Practitioner will be able to advise you if the medication you are taking will be affected by your detox, and if this is the case, will provide recommendations on what to do. Be sure to inform your Practitioner of any medication you are taking before you start your detox.
 Occasionally people may experience adverse symptoms during a detoxification program, such as nausea, changes in bowel function or headaches. Generally these are short-term and will resolve without need for intervention; however, you should discuss them with your Practitioner if they are severe or last more than a few days.
Ask your Practitioner today about the Metagenics Detoxification program; they are trained to support and guide you and will help you on your journey to true health and vitality.
