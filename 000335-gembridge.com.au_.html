business as a force for good. 
What it means to be B-Corp Certified
It is a commitment to work towards improved diversity and reduced inequality, a positive social impact on our team, communities and customers, a healthier environment, and  creation of more high-quality jobs with dignity and purpose.

People are at the core of Gembridge, and integral to our mission. We champion diversity and encourage applications from people regardless of their gender identity and expression, ethnicity, cultural background, sexual orientation, disability and age.  For our own team, we provide flexible work arrangements, professional development opportunities, and additional benefits, plus unique opportunities to actively be involved, network and volunteer in the NFP sector. 
This certification aligns closely with Gembridge’s purpose, mission, values and culture, and provides a guiding framework for all business decisions. This ensures that people, planet and purpose are considers, along with the commercial objectives and profit. Gembridge has a commitment to Food For Change, aligning with UN Sustainable Goal #2, Zero Hunger.
We are committed to minimising our impact on the environment. While Gembridge is mindful to operate at the highest ethical and socially responsible levels, we also take steps to ensure our suppliers and clients also have a focus on their own social and environmental impacts. Where possible, Gembridge purchases from social enterprises, B Corps or other organisations that demonstrate their commitment to our planet. 
B Corp certification is much more than just a symbol of trust for consumers. Joining the B Corp community demonstrates our on-going commitment to operating with people and planet as a focus, but also provides a business-wide framework to assess and improve as our company grows and evolves. This allows Gembridge to set goals and implement new practices to help expand for greater impact.
While our B Corp journey has just begun, maintaining our B Corp status will continually challenge us to think about how we are affecting our community, our employees, our candidates, our clients, and the environment.
