Best Ever Way to Drink a Takeaway
I absolutely love my L Uppercup.  I will return home to get it if I ever forget to bring it with me.  It deals well, the mouthpiece is ergonomic, feels good and you do t have to suck to hard.  It gives me joy!
This is a company to be commended and supported for a great story and exceptional customer service, WAY after the original sale, they are still invested in your feedback and 'cup' experience ~  thank you!
My favourite takeaway cup! Chic and secure
LOVE my Uppercup and have 3 of the different coloured lids so that I can change it up based on my mood/outfit. 
The lid is super secure which means no slip ups and it is really easy to clean. 
Would love if they brought out a plug for the sipper so when you're done on the go you can easily throw it in your bag.
I love my new Upper Cup. Firstly because it is Australian made. Second because two women entrepreneurs created this awesome cup. Third because it works really well And I can put it in the Dishwasher. Gotta love that!
Love the cup. Perfect size for my strong small flat whites and easily fits in my bag. Great product and great customer service and ordering experience. Highly recommend!
 Uppercup 12oz - Clear with Dusty Pink Lid 
This product came sooo quickly, I was very impressed! I absolutely love the pink colour and love the design of the detox water bottle and the coffee cups. Great customer service and it is a local Australian company too :)
 Uppercup 12oz - Clear with Dusty Pink Lid 
I was looking for a plastic-free takeaway coffee cup after my KeepCup broke. In the end I decided for this one because though it's made of plastic I was impressed that it was made in Australia, and wanted to support Australian businesses. The durable plastic also means it'll last a long time, so hopefully the longevity will combat the environmental effects as I would probably go through 2-3 glass ones in the same amount of time. It is easily washed in the dishwasher and I find it keeps drinks hotter for a longer amount of time than glass takeaway cups.
 Uppercup 12oz - White with White Lid 
I chose Uppercup after doing a lot of research online. I chose Uppercup because it was one of the most affordable choices on the market, but I couldn't be happier with it. Easy to clean and the ergonomic design means that the cup never burns my hands.
 Uppercup 12oz - Clear with Dusty Pink Lid 
Get stylish keepcup, damaged by an over zealous barista. Contacted 321 Water and had a replacement out to me within 24hrs. Could not be more impressed with the communication and responses let alone the cup!!!!
I LOVE MY UPPER CUP! I have one of each size (one for hot & one for cold coffee) they are great because it keeps your drink warm/cold! I also love that it doesn't retain any smells from the coffee, plus the lid is easy to drink from which means I don't end up with coffee on myself. I absolutely recommend!
 Uppercup 12oz - Clear with Dusty Pink Lid 
got a black uppercup as a reward from company.. works very well for me..very happy with this one!!!
Bought this cup and have used it so much! It is still in such good condition and what I like the most is how easy it is to use and how it doesn’t break when I drop it! One big plus is that it is super easy to wash! The pink colour is also really nice and looks even better irl!
 Uppercup 12oz - Clear with Dusty Pink Lid 
Bought 3 of these as gifts. So far the feedback from recipients is: looks nice, good compact size, cool to touch, easy to clean, no plastic' taste and non-spillage.

I love this cup, it feels very nice to hold and to drink out of, the lid secures firmly and it's so easy just to put in the dishwasher.
 Uppercup 12oz - Clear with Dusty Pink Lid 
I love this cup! It keeps my coffee hot but isn't too hot to handle. It also doesn't get stained by almost constant coffee use.

My favourite takeaway cup! Chic and secure
LOVE my Uppercup and have 3 of the different coloured lids so that I can change it up based on my mood/outfit. 
The lid is super secure which means no slip ups and it is really easy to clean. 
Would love if they brought out a plug for the sipper so when you're done on the go you can easily throw it in your bag.
Thank you for your awesome review! Love your mix and match idea. Looking forward to seeing you in our store once again.
I love my new Upper Cup. Firstly because it is Australian made. Second because two women entrepreneurs created this awesome cup. Third because it works really well And I can put it in the Dishwasher. Gotta love that!
