A typical Not-for-profit funding model is not resilient. With heavy reliance on government grants and philanthropy, many organisations are exposed to risk of funding loss or do not have discretionary funds to target towards areas where they see need.
Recent years have seen the rise in demand for organisation’s to demonstrate their impact. This demand has come from funders, donors, staff and the community, and with the rise of trends such as consumer-directed and outcomes-based funding, this expectation is only going to increase.
Listen and learn together. It’s time to say YES.

It captures Aboriginal aspirations for a fair and honest relationship with government and a better future for Aboriginal children based on justice and self-determination.

Our team’s experience weaves a rich tapestry of insight, which we proudly bring to all of our work. Having held senior positions across all sectors and having done the consulting rounds with firms from the top end of town to sole traders, we bring both technical excellence and deep sector insight.
Each year we get to share with you the work we have been doing in a format that’s not about us at all. It’s about the magnificent humans we get to work with, the world they are changing and how they are going about changing it… Welcome to our FY2020/21 Spark Impact Report!
Spark Strategy works with leaders who are as excited by ideas as we are, who want to take action and transform. And we stick with you to achieve outcomes, favouring long-term relationships over draft and dash plans. Our approach is highly interactive and all about bringing energy into the process through team-based workshops and activities that spark moments of discovery. We do the heavy lifting behind the scenes, stretching and probing the ideas before rigorously planning out the execution with you and building the organisational stamina required for your transformation. We employ both traditional consulting tools (without the consultant-speak) and creative tools to help unearth ideas that are practical yet innovative.
We started Spark because we identified a lack of transformational strategies and a lack of financially sustainable solutions to social challenges. We firmly believe that with the right ideas, capability and capital, we can change the narrative. We have curated our team to ensure that we have deep knowledge and networks across sectors so that we can help our clients align the jigsaw pieces for large-scale impact.
Cups of Coffee (and 1355 Cups of Tea)
We recognise each sector has a role to play in social change. While the majority of our work is with the not-for-profit sector, we also work across the other sectors on projects to improve social outcomes. Leveraging our unique positioning, we work with individual organisations and we also bring coalitions together for collective strategies, be they place-based solutions, sector reform or system change.
From health to the arts, education to justice, disability to family violence, our work spans the entire Not-for-profit sector. We work with bold leaders in this space to generate greater impact and build financial strength.
Adopting a systemic view, we work across all altitudes of government to innovate social policy. We have internationally sought-after experience in co-design with lived experience as well as design of the enabling environment to support policy implementation.
Gone are the days where shareholder return is the only measure of success of the private sector. We work with our Corporate clients to ensure their community investment is strategic, social license to operate is authentic, and cross sector partnerships drive shared value.
We address both sides of the coin in our work with Australia’s most significant Foundations. We assist with fundraising strategies to grow corpus funds, and we develop granting strategies to maximise the impact of contributions.
We are here to be the trusted advisor, to help inject creative ideas, challenge thinking, and create alignment between the conceptual and the practical. Here is what you can expect of Spark.

Working with leaders to generate ideas, capability and capital.
We believe that traditional approaches to strategic planning do not allow for lateral thinking, and in essence, new ideas. However, if we are to address society’s most wicked challenges, seeking transformation, new ideas are exactly what we need.
We do strategic planning differently- by first engaging in an expansive, creative process, before we turn to look at what an organisation does today.
After bringing in traditional tools to stress test ideas, we then we take the all-important step of translating concepts into pragmatic action, so that the final document doesn’t just end up buried deep on a website, but clearly guides the decisions of Boards and Executives.
As trusted advisors, we help our clients with strategic planning through projects, coaching and capability building.
A typical Not-for-profit funding model is not resilient. With heavy reliance on government grants and philanthropy, many organisations are exposed to risk of funding loss or do not have discretionary funds to target towards areas where they see need.
Through our business model projects, we work with clients to explore new revenue streams, with the aim of diversifying and increasing income. Our profit for purpose solutions can comprise a range of opportunities such as commercialisation of products and services, strategic partnerships and asset realisation.
With strong networks in the venture philanthropy and impact investing arenas, we help create compelling business cases for investment, detailing the business plans required to bring the models to life.
Recent years have seen the rise in demand for organisation’s to demonstrate their impact. This demand has come from funders, donors, staff and the community, and with the rise of trends such as consumer-directed and outcomes-based funding, this expectation is only going to increase.
While impact measurement has become an arguably over-complicated discipline in its own right, we help our clients to cut through the noise and create evidence-based, compelling narratives that demonstrate the impact they are creating.
The process starts by ensuring that there is a clearly articulated theory of change, then it’s about mapping data that you already have, and combining the measurable facts, with real-life case studies.
We not only focus on an organisation’s individual impact, but we also consider broader frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals and social determinants of health, cascading the impact to align to powerful collective narratives.
Underpinning the successful execution of any strategy is an organisation’s operating model; namely, its people, processes and systems.
We take business planning the extra step and help to map out the key processes that an organisation needs to deliver its critical business, as well as any new strategy.
We work through operational planning with our clients to ensure that organisational designs have the right people, in the right roles, to bring the strategy to life.
And we look at the underlying systems to identify whether any changes in infrastructure, e.g. digital technologies could enhance efficiency or effectiveness.
Having a clear sense of how the triumvirate of these three components come together, gives leaders the information they need to make resourcing and investment decisions to support their aspirations.
Outcomes-focused strategy must be designed with input from beneficiaries. Co-design is therefore a pivotal step of any strategic initiative.
We have developed a market-leading reputation for co-design processes that involve vulnerable participants. We understand the balance between sensitivities and driving outcomes, and we know how to remove power from a room when there is a combination of lived experience, funders and practitioners in a session.
In addition to external community engagement, our projects also involved a number of internal facilitated sessions with our clients. These workshops enable teams to lift their heads above the day to day, and ask the really important questions such as what problems we exist to solve and for whom? Our interpersonal approach is engaging and fun, without being frivolous, and as a result of COVID-19, we now have the capability to run these sessions in person or digitally.
Achieve great outcomes & build strong relationships.

We help for purpose organisations with strategic planning, business models and operating models for a better impact.
Sparks Strategy specialises in strategic planning, crafting innovative and sustainable business strategies tailored to your company’s specific goals. Our approach revolves around collaborative workshops, interviews, and thorough analysis to develop a strong strategic framework. We begin by identifying your unique value proposition and continue to track key performance indicators, ensuring alignment with your mission statement, strategic objectives, and long-term vision. Our strategic management process concentrates on enhancing your competitive advantages and gaining a deep understanding of the business environment through SWOT analysis.
We collaborate with our clients rather than dictating to them. Our belief is that fostering collaboration is the key to generating fresh solutions and models. That’s why our process heavily relies on workshops and interviews, accompanied by rigorous behind-the-scenes analysis. We employ a variety of consulting tools without using jargon, ensuring the strategic planning process is effective in eliciting and testing ideas. Moreover, many of these tools and methodologies can be shared with employees, extending their usefulness beyond the scope of the strategy development project.
Regardless of your project scope, we’re committed to fostering business growth that transcends the entire company. It’s an ongoing process with Spark. Contact us for an appointment today and fuel your future with Spark Strategy.
From facilitated workshops to comprehensive strategic plans, our approach is centered on value-based design and we begin with defining your unique value proposition. Regardless of the project scope, we engage with our clients in a tailored manner, drawing upon our well-established ideas-led approach. Our primary goal is to create practical, sustainable strategies that are both cutting-edge and inspiring, while also being achievable.True to our principles of value-driven design, our creative approach is supplemented by research, analysis, and action planning, which ensures that the inspiring ideas generated can be practically achieved, rather than ending up lost in a glossy report.
The majority of our strategic planning work involves full strategy development. In such cases, organisations seek to create a new, comprehensive strategy that actively involves key stakeholders and encourages innovative thinking. This process typically incorporates a combination of one-on-one or small group interviews with important internal and external stakeholders, co-design sessions with community members and customers, desktop research, document review, as well as strategy workshops with the Board, Executive, and broader team.
Strategic planning can be complex, costly and time-consuming process, but it doesn’t have to be. Our strategic refresh simplifies the strategic planning process and is perfect for organisations short on time or with limited resources. A strategic refresh typically takes about three weeks and is centred around a handful of 1:1 interview discussions and two leadership workshops.
We have also conducted hundreds of one-day strategy facilitations, wherein we conduct a full-day workshop and then step back. This arrangement is often in partnership with organizations that have already undertaken most of the strategic thinking or have budget constraints.

Key elements of a strategic plan
What makes a great strategic plan?
Step-by-step guide to the strategic planning process
Step 1: Scoping and bedding down the logistics
Step 2: Generating ideas and shaping the key concepts
Step 3: Testing the thinking to date
Step 4: Adding in detail and ensuring an action-orientation
A strategic plan is an organisation’s guiding light. It sets out why an organisation exists, its priorities and goals for the coming years, and what brings the team together. This supports decision-making and activity at all levels so the organisation is clear about what it will and won’t focus upon, and what behaviours and ways of working are expected.
In the for-purpose sector, a strategic plan is particularly important because it articulates the wicked social or environmental problem (or opportunity) being addressed and an organisation’s role in solving that issue. For example, a not-for-profit might be working towards a society in which everyone is safe and housed, and their specific focus is upon supporting those experiencing homelessness who are living and sleeping on the street.
Many organisations now have a one-page version of their strategy that conveys their key concepts as well as a more detailed strategic plan. The length of a strategic plan can range from one page to 100 pages or more. We find that strategies from five to 15 pages tend to be a good length as they are compelling and accessible, whilst also containing some of the key detail.
Key elements of a strategic plan
Different people use different words for the components of a strategic plan but, in our experience, it generally boils down to the following elements.
Our big aspiration. What we are seeking to achieve.
How, at a high level, we contribute to our vision. Our high level role.
The concepts that define our shared principles and way of working.
Priorities, pillars, objectives, goals or themes
The 3-5 things we will focus upon for the duration of this strategy. These can either be outcome or activity statements.
The strategic projects and activities that sit under our priorities.
How we will monitor and assess progress against our strategy. May also be referred to as KPIs or targets.
In addition, there are a number of strategy components that may be included within the elements listed above or not explicitly mentioned at all.
The group or community that we focus our efforts upon.
The space or area in which we work and/or are trying to bring about change.
The level(s) of the system that we operate in, such as service delivery or products, collaboration, and advocacy and system reform.
Some strategic plans also have a section about their organisation, which may include its history, a summary of services or products, and key strengths and weaknesses. In addition, there is often a section about the external environment, which may highlight strategic trends, disruptions, predictions, opportunities, challenges and other considerations.
Key elements of a strategic plan
In our opinion, the things that define a great strategy:
 This is about having a strategy that is easy to read and understand. Think short sentences, simple language and a clear layout. Your strategy should be accessible to everyone in your organisations, clients and customers, beneficiaries and partners. You may also want to think about how to make your strategy available to people who are blind or low vision, such as through a video format or ensuring high contrast with font colours on backgrounds.
 A strategy, particularly not-for-profit strategy, should be inspiring. This is about why you exist – why your organisation is necessary or beneficial. In the for-purpose space, this is about the wicked challenges our societies are facing, and how to counter that. It can be helpful to think about whether your statements are powerful – do they convey inequality and hope?
 Long strategies have a tendency to sit on a shelf and gather dust. We find that strategies from five to 15 pages tend to be a good length as they are compelling and accessible, whilst also containing some of the key detail.
Visual and easy on the eye
 Densely written reams of paper also have a tendency to get shelved. So, consider how you can translate key strategy concepts into a visual format, through icons, photos and other images. Effectively using colour and white space also have an important role to play here.
To define the strategy elements listed above, organisations undertake strategic planning. Essentially, strategic planning is the process of reviewing why an organisation exists and determining key focus areas for the years ahead. This demonstrates the importance of strategic planning, with more detail provided below.
Strategy development is the responsibility of an organisation’s leadership, typically its executive team and board. However, effective strategic planning generally involves a broader range of stakeholders, such as staff, customers or clients, beneficiaries, partners, suppliers, funders, policy-makers and potentially even competitors.
There are different approaches to and types of strategic planning, and it comes in all different shapes and sizes. Strategy development includes everything from a one day workshop through to a largescale project that lasts for many months. Regardless, in general, strategic planning involves a combination of desk-based work (e.g. research and analysis) and stakeholder engagement (e.g. 1:1 conversations, small group discussions, meetings and workshops).

Are you questioning the importance of strategic planning? If so, we’ve listed our top rebuttals to your concern or cynicism.
Define your “true north” in a compelling and accessible manner
In not-for-profit strategy, strategic planning enables you to powerfully articulate your why. By having a clearly defined “true north”, you are better placed to: recruit and retain a team that really believes in your mission; partner with organisations pursuing the same or complementary goals; clearly communicate your purpose to the community and in the media; and secure funding from government, philanthropic and corporate partners. In addition, clarity around why your organisation exists is critical in determining what you will and won’t do.
Gain valuable insights from close to home and further afield
Effective strategy development will surface helpful information about the challenges and opportunities at hand. This can be through sharing case studies of best practice or thought leadership, or providing insights about your industry, sector, region, community or organisation. These nuggets of wisdom can mean a variety of things. For some, strategic planning insights shakes up their thinking and move organisations in a new direction. For others, the information unearthed during the strategy development process further hones their focus and understanding around particular areas.
Minimise uncertainty and stay ahead of the curve
The times they are a changing, and that can be confusing and worrying. Strategic planning helps organisations sort through the disruptions and trends, and consider their implications for teams, communities and the environment. Strategic planning can also help organisations figure out how to be the disruptor, rather than the disrupted. With a plan in place around how to address challenges, which opportunities to pursue and how to navigate the rapidly changing landscape, leaders and their teams have greater clarity and less bewilderment.
Better engage your internal and external stakeholders 
Having the big conversations with your stakeholders, and really listening to what they say, is a way to learn and to demonstrate how much you value them. Picking the right people to engage and crafting excellent questions and discussions points for those involved in the strategic planning process is key. Poorly written, vague or misleading questions directed means discussions are either low in energy, inefficient or irrelevant. So, think carefully about who to involve in strategy development and what to ask them.
Make better decisions at all levels of your organisation
With a set purpose, priorities and principles, all members of the team will have a clear guide to make decisions. A strategic plan is a great tool in helping leaders and staff determine what to focus their efforts upon, how to conduct themselves and how to communicate the organisation to others. The worst outcome is for a strategic plan to just be a shiny document that sits buried deep in a website or a desk drawer. It should be living and breathing, with its goals cascaded all the way through an organisation down to individual work plans. Board reporting should also align with the strategy so that Directors are having their discussions at the right altitude and they can have comfort, as custodians of the strategy, that the ship is being steered in the right direction.
If you onboard that strategy development is a vital business activity, regardless of whether you’re profit-generating or not, we’re with you. If you’re not convinced of the importance of strategic planning, leave us a comment at the end of this article – we’d love to hear your thoughts.
Strategic planning isn’t the end of the story. It’s only the beginning. Strategy implementation (also called strategy execution) is ultimately about translating your strategic plan into action. Given that strategic planning is high level in nature, strategic plans often need to be translated into operational plans. This typically happens on a quarterly or annual basis. Operational plans often include more detail about specific projects and tasks, when these will happen, who be responsible for them and what resources these undertakings require. As well as rolling out the initiatives or activities listed in your plan, many organisations will monitor, report on and evaluate performance to a range of strategic indicators or targets. It’s vital with implementation to have the balance of following a plan but also being flexible and responsive to accommodate changes – this is not always an easy path to walk.
We recommend reviewing your strategy at least annually. This is about asking yourself how you are progressing and performing, as well as whether the strategy is relevant and comprehensive. Did you miss a consideration or key stakeholder in the strategic planning process? Does something need to be added to or removed from your strategic plan?
Furthermore, and as we’ve noted already, change is happening. For many individuals, organisations and industries, that change is coming thick and fast. As such, there are other times where it might be pertinent to review your strategic plan e.g. when a crisis occurs, when a new CEO comes on board etc.
Step 1: Scoping and bedding down the logistics
At the end of this stage, you will have a clearly defined project scope and a timeline with key activities and deadlines.
To get started with your strategic planning process, we’ve outlined a number of key questions to consider:
What does success look like for our strategic planning process?
What does success look like for the strategy itself? Do we have a preferred length, style or other strategy characteristics in mind?
What is the likely duration of our strategic plan?
Are there elements of our current strategy that we want to carry forward into our new strategy?
Who has ultimate sign off on the strategy?
Who will drive our strategic planning process? Will strategy development be conducted by our team or facilitated by external consultants?
Who will we engage through the strategic planning process? Will we engage our Board, Executive and broader team? Will we engage our community, beneficiaries or customers? Will we engage external partners and funders?
How will we engage stakeholders in the strategic planning process? Will we use surveys, 1:1 discussions, focus groups, workshops?
What does governance of our strategic planning process look like? Will we set up a project steering committee or project control board?
What are the project risks for our strategic planning process?
Step 2: Generating ideas and shaping the key concepts
Ideas are what will spark a brighter future for your organisation. This is why it makes sense to put ideas first in your strategic planning process, rather than dwell on constraints and risks at this point in time. This phase is about being creative and discussing your aspirations in the interest of exploring and unearthing bright and novel ideas.
When the second stage has been completed, you’ll have a draft one page strategy which includes your vision, mission/purpose, values and a set of strategic priorities or objectives.
This phase requires consideration of the below:
Your organisation – what are your strengths and weaknesses? How has your organisation evolved over time?
The external environment – what are the key trends and disruptions we need to respond to? What opportunities and challenges are there? Are there other organisations or programs we can learn from? Who are our strategic partners?
Your vision – what is the world or society we want to live in? What problem do we exist to solve? What ultimate benefit or impact are we looking to achieve?
Your mission or purpose – what is our role in achieving our vision / solving a particular problem? What is our core purpose? At a high level, what do we exist to do?
Your cohort – who do we exist for? Who are our beneficiaries, clients or customers? Do we have a primary cohort that is our absolute priority?
Your geography – where do we focus our efforts? Is our geographic remit staying the same, increasing or reducing? How does digital fit into our geography?
Your values or beliefs – what makes our organisation unique? What beliefs and values unite us? What attitudes and behaviours brings out the best in our team?
Your strategic planning narrative – are you seeking radical transformation or large-scale growth over the coming years? Or are you more interested in bedding down the foundations or consolidating your current position?
Your strategic priorities or objectives – what are our top priorities for the coming years? What will we focus our efforts upon for the coming years? What will we do that’s different to prior years?
Your altitude of play – are we providing services to individuals and/or are we working to bring about system change? How do partnerships fit into our approach?
Step 3: Testing the thinking to date
Now that the creative component of your strategic planning process is done, it’s time to apply rigour and analysis to test your ideas. In the testing phase of strategy development, you can employ traditional strategic frameworks such as SWOT, PESTLE and Porter’s Five Forces to see how your initial thinking stack up. Scenario analysis can also be helpful at this stage of the strategic planning process to consider how your ideas and priorities will fare in different contexts.
By the time you’re done and dusted with the third stage, you will have a refined strategy on a page, which will act as the foundations to further detail your strategic plan.
To test your strategic planning thinking, it may be helpful to answer:
Is the strategy helpful in guiding our decision-making? Does the strategy clarify what we will do and what we won’t do?
Have we missed any key concepts or considerations in our draft strategy?
Does our strategy clearly demonstrate a strong value proposition and how we are unique?
What political, economic, sociodemographic and technological developments are relevant to our draft strategy? Does the strategy appropriately factor in and respond to these considerations?
Are there specific scenarios we could use to test our draft strategy? This could include: a change of government; an economic, environmental or health crisis; or a new, highly effective competitor entering the market.
Is the language and layout we have used compelling and accessible?
How long will our strategy concepts be relevant? Is the duration of our strategy still appropriate?
Step 4: Adding in detail and ensuring an action-orientation
Ideas are only as good as their best execution. This phase of the strategic planning process is about converting the high level strategic concepts into a practical action plan and indicators to measure and track performance. The challenge here is ensuring the thinking remains strategic, rather than getting into the nuts and bolts of operational planning.
There are two key areas to consider in the action planning phase of strategy development:
Initiatives or actions – how can we implement our priorities? What should we start, stop and keep doing?
Metrics or indicators – how will we know we are progressing and performing? What can we track to assess whether we are being successful? What indicates we are effectively implementing our strategic plan?
Once you have run through these four steps of the strategic planning process, you’ll have a clear sense of your vision, purpose and values as well as the priorities and the associated initiatives and indicators. In addition, you’ll have a solid understanding of your own organisational strengths and weaknesses, and considerations arising from the external environment. This content can then be shaped into a full strategic plan, which generally ranges from five pages to 25 pages in length.
We work with our clients, not to them. We believe that bringing people together is the way to spark new solutions and models. That’s why our process is heavily workshop and interview-based, complemented by ample “behind the scenes” rigour and analysis. We use a range of consulting tools (without the consultant-speak!) throughout the strategic planning process to elicit and test ideas. Many of these tools and methodologies can be shared with employees to be used beyond the scope of the strategy development project.
We’ve included a couple of strategic planning examples below. We really enjoyed facilitating the strategic planning process with both Good Shepherd Australia New Zealand and Surf Life Saving New South Wales, and look forward to seeing their future successes.

Business model design for impact and sustainability: A step-by-step guide
Sustainable funding is today’s holy grail for leaders of for-purpose organisations. Predictably, it’s proving to be just as elusive. Boards, leaders, researchers, consultants and think tanks alike are engaged in a limited conversation that starts and ends with funding models. We strongly believe that there is no such thing as a sustainable funding model. Instead, our experience demonstrates that business models centred on long-term value creation are the solution for greater impact and financial sustainability. In this article, we define a business model, provide a step-by-step guide for how to design an impactful and sustainable one, and share other key insights and considerations.
Key elements of a business model?
How to create a business model?
Before we get into how to review and transform your business model, we’ve provided definitions of the jargon that tends to crop up in for-purpose and sustainable business model discussions
In the private sector, a business model is generally about how an organisation delivers value to its customers. The delivery comprises the key operational components that create and provide value, which generates an organisation’s cost structures. The engagement with customers is the market-facing elements of the business model, which come together to form an organisation’s revenue. Furthermore, a business model is the level below an organisational strategic plan, and can be further detailed through an operating model, which specifies the capabilities, processes and infrastructure required to function.
When it comes to for-purpose business models, things are a little different and, arguably, a little more complicated. This is because many not-for-profits and other for-purpose organisations are not focussed on selling to customers. Instead, these agencies are committed to driving positive social and environmental change for communities. As such, value creation is typically for a range of stakeholders, whereby beneficiaries, consumers and/or users (i.e. those who benefit from a product or service) may be different to funders and customers (i.e. those who pay for a product or service). A specific example is a soup van, which provides meals to people experiencing homelessness (the beneficiaries) at no cost to them, as a result of grant funding from the government (the customer or funder).
Key elements of a business model
A business model outlines an organisation’s value, who benefits from that value, and how this translates into income streams. In addition, a business model shows – at a high level – the activities that support value creation, and the associated cost structures. Ultimately, a business model maps and drives value creation and revenue generation.
So what’s actually in a business model? What are the key elements of a business model? What do we mean by business model components? Well, there’s the external, market-facing components and the internal, operational components, both of which relate to value propositions. The market-facing elements include things like customers (or funders or donors), service users (or beneficiaries) and channels to market, which come together to shape current and potential revenue streams. The operational components include things like key activities, key resources and partners, which drive cost structures. 
In 2008, Alexander Osterwalder developed the Business Model Canvas. It’s a means to organise and articulate key components of, and assumptions about, an organisation’s business model, in a way that demonstrates their interdependence. The Business Model Canvas is a useful tool for mapping, discussing, amending and inventing business models. This means the Business Model Canvas can be applied to businesses of any age and stage, from start-ups to organisations that have been kicking around for decades.
The Business Model Canvas sets out the nine building blocks of an organisation’s business model on a pre-structured template:
 – the people and organisations who access and pay for your products, services and other offerings;
 – the benefits gained and/or problems solved for each customer segment;
 – the touchpoints and interactions you have with customers and the ways you deliver value, which could include face-to-face meetings, customer service lines, events, social media, word-of-mouth, eNewsletters, networks and committees, and more;
 – the types of relationships you build with your customers, which might include transactional, personalised, intimate, one-off or ongoing;
 – the income you generate through delivering value, such as fee-for-service payments, IP licensing, government grants, donations from the general public etc.;
 – the assets you require to deliver value, including people, building and facilities, software, hardware, equipment, policies and processes;
 – the major functions which you need to deliver value, such as customer service, marketing, human resources, finance and planning;
 – the people and organisations you can collaborate with to deliver value, ideally for mutual benefit, noting that partnerships may increase or decrease your expenses; and
 – the expenses associated with your activities, resources and partnerships.
At Spark, given we work entirely with not-for-profit and other for-purpose organisations, we have made some tweaks to the Business Model Canvas to better suit our clients.
, which includes service users (or beneficiaries) and customers (including funders and donors). As noted above, impact-led teams and organisations may be providing services to one cohort of people (e.g. giving child health and safety information to first-time parents) which is paid for by someone else (e.g. a government department or foundation). Alternatively, a social enterprise café might have primary beneficiaries (e.g. young people experiencing disadvantage who get a job and training), who are different to service users (e.g. people buying coffees). In this instance, the service users – who are people buying coffees – are also the customers. As such, it is critical to explicitly include both service users and customers. 
To ensure a continued focus on and commitment to purpose, it can be helpful to adapt the Business Model Canvas to have a row up top where organisations speak to their impact. To differentiate this from value propositions, this is sometimes about systemic or long-term benefits.
To define the strategy elements listed above, organisations undertake strategic planning. Essentially, strategic planning is the process of reviewing why an organisation exists and determining key focus areas for the years ahead. This demonstrates the importance of strategic planning, with more detail provided below.
Strategy development is the responsibility of an organisation’s leadership, typically its executive team and board. However, effective strategic planning generally involves a broader range of stakeholders, such as staff, customers or clients, beneficiaries, partners, suppliers, funders, policy-makers and potentially even competitors.
There are different approaches to and types of strategic planning, and it comes in all different shapes and sizes. Strategy development includes everything from a one day workshop through to a largescale project that lasts for many months. Regardless, in general, strategic planning involves a combination of desk-based work (e.g. research and analysis) and stakeholder engagement (e.g. 1:1 conversations, small group discussions, meetings and workshops).
In its most basic definition, financial sustainability is when your revenue equals or exceeds your costs. However, this position does not guarantee long-term survival or stability. That’s why, at Spark, we think about financial sustainability in terms of longevity and resilience, rather than a snapshot of financial performance at a given moment. Generally, for our clients, income diversification is key here as this can drive growth and reduce risk. A note that revenue diversification can come in different forms – namely different customer groups (e.g. government, philanthropy, corporate, general public) or different revenue types (e.g. grants, fee-for-service, donations).
How to create a business model
At Spark, we have a proven process when it comes to business model review and business model design. We put value propositions at the heart of these conversations and use tools like the Business Model Canvas and techniques like design thinking to get the best possible outcomes. We’ve outlined steps to create a sustainable business model below.
The first step is to have objectives that clarify the outcomes you’re seeking from the business model design or business model review. This is about knowing the drivers for change, what you want to achieve and the key questions you’ll ask along the way. This could be financial sustainability, increased reach, greater impact or something else entirely.
The following questions are likely to be useful at this stage of your business model discussions?
What does success look like for this business model projects?
What would a sustainable business model mean for us?
What does success look like for the final deliverable?
Do we have a preferred length, style or other characteristics in mind?
Are there elements for our current business model that we want to carry forward?
Is there anything in our current business model that is not up for grabs or discussion?
What are the key questions we want to explore and answer through this business model work?
You may want to write down one or more outcome statements as well as a list of key questions and requirements, and keep coming back to this document throughout the project.
Once you have agreed objectives in place, it’s time to get your ducks lined up so you have a clear project plan. This is about mapping out a timeline with defined activities, roles and responsibilities, and project risks.
Questions that we generally find useful at this stage of our own business model projects are:
Who has ultimate sign off on our new or refined business model?
Who will drive this sustainable business model work? Will it be conducted by our team or facilitated by external consultants? If we are doing the work in-house, do members of our team need training around business models and business model design?
What budget and resources do we have to conduct this work?
Who will we engage to review and enhance our business model? Who will we engage from our Board, Executive and broader team? Which community members, consumers, beneficiaries and/or customers will we engage? Will we engage external partners and funders? Who else has ideas about how our business model could be improved or has their own innovative business model?
How will we engage stakeholders? Will we use surveys, one-on-one discussions, focus groups, workshops or online engagement tools (e.g. word clouds)?
What does governance of this business model work look like? Will we set up a project steering committee or project control board?
What are the project risks for this business model project?
Unless you’re starting completely from scratch (i.e. you’re a brand new start-up), you’ll probably want to map your current business model first. This is about understanding your current business model, and assessing its strengths and weaknesses. In addition, and to avoid an insular approach, it’s worth look at what others are doing. This is about researching who has an innovative business model, a sustainable business model or an effective business model.
How would you describe your organisation’s business model? 
What works well and is effective about your current business model?
What doesn’t work well or is ineffective about your existing business model? 
Have you mapped your current business model to the Strategyzer Business
What are others in your industry or sector doing? How would you describe and characterise their business models? Who can we learn from because they are demonstrating innovation or high performance?
Creative thinking that lets new ideas emerge and flourish is central to our approach at Spark. This is because we really believe that ideas are what will spark a brighter future for your organisation and greater impact for your community.
We have a few pieces of advice for this stage. Firstly, take a position where you won’t limit your thinking. This is about explicitly stating to yourself and others that all options and ideas are on the table, and any “black hat” thinking is to be parked for the time being. While it’s simple, another useful technique is to ask open-ended questions rather than closed questions that lead to yes/no answers. This could include phrases such as “tell me more about…” or “what would happen if we….” We’ve also found it useful to use tools like 
 or draw on creativity theories, such as David Eagleman and Anthony Brandt’s view that creativity is about blending, breaking and bending existing solutions, products and ideas. You can read more in their book 
The Runaway Species: How Human Creativity Remakes the World 
In thinking creatively about your business model, we generally cover off on the following:
What problems do we exist to solve? For whom?
How else could we support and benefit our existing beneficiaries, consumers and customers? Does this translate into new products, services and/or income streams?
How else could we support and benefit our existing funders and partners?
Does our value apply to other stakeholder groups? Does this translate into new products, services and/or income streams?
What other partnership opportunities are there for us? How would these impact the other components of our business model?
Could we tailor and adapt another organisation’s business model or a component of their business model? What would this mean for our organisation and the work we do?
Now that the creative component of your business model review is done, it’s time to apply rigour and analysis to test your ideas. In the testing phase of business model development, you can employ traditional frameworks such as SWOT, PESTLE and Porter’s Five Forces to see how your initial thinking stacks up. We also strongly recommend financial modelling (high level P&L forecasting at the least) to stress test your candidate business model(s). Scenario analysis can also be helpful at this stage to consider how your business model option(s) will fare in different contexts.
To test your sustainable business model thinking to date, it may be helpful to answer:
Which business model option will best deliver on the objectives we defined at the start of the project?
Does our business model articulate a relevant and strong value proposition or set of value propositions?
Have we missed any key concepts or considerations in our candidate sustainable business model(s)?
What political, economic, sociodemographic and technological developments are relevant? Does the business model appropriately factor in and respond to these considerations?
Are there specific scenarios we could use to test our business model option(s)? This could include: a change of government; an economic, environmental or health crisis; or a new, highly effective competitor entering the market.
What revenue streams comprise our new sustainable business model? What does a P&L forecast show for the coming years? Do we anticipate making a loss, breaking even or turning a profit? What is our appetite for financial risk?
Do we have the capacity and capability to deliver this business model? If not, do we have the resources for training, recruiting or outsourcing?
By the time you’re done and dusted with this stage, you will have identified one business model to take forward.
Get practical: Make a plan from here
We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: ideas are only as good as their best execution. This phase of the process is about taking the business model concepts and ideas that have come to the fore, and developing a practical action roadmap and indicators. The action roadmap will help you establish, or transition to, a sustainable business model. The indicators will help you measure and track performance.
At Spark, we refer to this phase as ‘action planning’ and there are two key sets of questions to consider here
Get going and keep going: Implement and evaluation
By now you’ve defined a new sustainable business model and developed a supporting action plan. This means the hard work begins now – implementation. In transitioning to a new or refined business model, you may need to consider things like human resources, internal communications, technology, systems and processes. And then don’t rest on your laurels. Our view is take a continuous improvement approach to your business model. This is about tracking progress and performance based on the indicators you mapped in the last stage. It’s also about asking questions like is anything missing from our sustainable business model that would add more value? Is there anything we should stop doing because it isn’t delivering a lot of value? What are others doing in our sector and adjacent sectors, and what can we learn from them?
At Spark, we work with our clients, not to them. From facilitated workshops to bespoke one-on-one interviews, all of our engagements are highly interpersonal. Our approach is centered on value-based design, combining subject matter expertise with extracted insights to develop solutions that are cutting edge, inspiring and achievable. We pride ourselves on getting to the heart of your business and making it our own. That means when you partner with us you gain a team of highly qualified advisors who will work alongside your own staff to build their capability and ensure that your business model meets all of its financial, social and environmental obligations.
We believe that documentation alone provides little value without the skills and expertise to execute, refresh or adapt the business model as your organisation grows and transforms. Therefore, our approach is grounded in building the capacity of our clients to ensure that our work remains relevant beyond the bounds of our engagement. We openly share our IP with our clients through the form of highly practical tools, techniques and facilitation approaches that can be revisited at any time to address a range of strategic, governance or reporting challenges.
Our process to review, design and transform your business model is heavily workshop and interview-based, complemented by ample “behind the scenes” rigour and analysis. As such, we generally structure our projects around two or three key business model workshops, which are then accompanied by meetings, one-on-one discussions, desk-based research, financial modelling and other activities. Furthermore, we use a range of tools throughout the process to elicit and test ideas. Many of these tools and methodologies can be shared with employees to be used beyond the scope of the project.
One last point to make on what we offer – every business model project we work on is bespoke. This is because generic approaches to business models that blend greater impact with financial resilience do not work. As such, we tailor our process and our insights to the unique goals, assets, strengths, expertise, capacity and budgets of our clients. This means our sustainable business model projects vary in scope, duration and solution, and we offer everything from “do it with me” to “do it for me” approaches. Saying that, our preferences is very much for the “do it with me” approach in the interest of building capability and ensuring ownership amongst your team.
Some examples of our work to develop sustainable business models include:
We don’t think it’s as simple as picking your favourite model from a list of business model examples or working your way through the typical stages of funding strategy development. Leaders searching for sustainability must look long, be flexible and encourage creativity to have any hope of preparing their organisation for the future. It will take time and it will fundamentally change your organisation, but there is everything to be gained from engaging in this process. A sustainable business model will put your organisation on the path to greater impact and resilience.

What Is Impact Measurement - What It Is, Why It Matters?
Read our last whitepaper: The SDGS – An Australian Handbook 
We help for purpose organisations with strategic planning, business models and operating models for a better impact.
Impact measurement. Theory of change. Impact evaluation. Program logic. Outcomes measurement. These terms are bandied around a lot in the for-purpose sector but can be confusing and even intimidating for people. In this article, we demystify measuring your impact and talk through how to embed an impact measurement framework. While measuring your impact may initially appear daunting, the key is to get stuck in and continually look for ways to enhance your approach. So, happy reading and good luck!
Why is it important to measure and demonstrate impact?
What makes up an impact measurement framework?
What’s the relationship between strategy and impact measurement?
More on the theory of change
More on an impact measurement framework
Purpose and elements of an impact measurement framework
How to develop an impact measurement framework
Key risks and considerations when developing an impact measurement framework
When should you review your impact measurement approach?
Bringing it to life: An impact measurement example
So, tell me: what is impact measurement?
Impact measurement is how your organisation evidence and demonstrates the results of your work. It’s about going beyond tracking what you do (your activities) to monitoring and articulating the so what? (your outcomes and impact).
Another way to think of impact measurement is:
 “if we do X, then Y happens”; and
 how do we track and demonstrate the Y?
A social impact measurement example here is an organisation that provides information and education about healthy eating (this is their activities, or the ‘X’). They are seeking to increase awareness about the importance of diet and support behaviour change so people eat more fruit and vegetables (these are the outcomes they seek, or the ‘Y’).
They can track their activities fairly easily by monitoring things like:
the number of healthy eating information resources they develop and provide
the number and location of healthy eating education sessions they run
the number of people who download their materials or attend their education sessions.
When it comes to evidencing the outcomes they achieve or contribute to, they could:
provide people who attended the healthy eating classes with pre-and post-session surveys to see if there was a change in knowledge and attitudes
contact education participants a few months after the session to see if their fruit and vegetable intake had increased
look at the municipality, state, federal or other public data relating to rates of obesity, and average fruit and vegetable intake.
We wanted to get in early with a word of warning about the term ‘measurement’. Some people associate measurement with numbers. This is extremely limiting, especially given the complexity of social, economic, cultural and environmental change. In our opinion, effective and meaningful social impact measurement needs to include quantitative data and qualitative information. The latter includes people with lived experience sharing what’s changed for them, on-the-ground insights from frontline workers, and themes and trends observed by thought leaders.
Why is it important to measure and demonstrate impact?
At its heart, impact measurement helps your organisation understand whether it is driving positive change. This is vitally important for all for-purpose organisations. By better understanding your impact, you can make decisions about which activities to start, enhance, stop or change.
Other key benefits of impact measurement include:
Enhanced decision-making on what to do and what not to do, based on what’s proven to be impactful. This can be strategic,  operational and tactical.
Demonstrate to service users, communities,  partners and stakeholders that you are committed to positive change and playing your part in making it a reality.
Inspire and motivate your team by articulating the positive change you are contributing to and evidencing your organisation’s successes and achievements.
Better engage with your existing funders and customers by clearly showing how their investment in your activities, products or services is driving positive outcomes.
Demonstrate your impact to attract new employees, volunteers and board directors to your organisation.
Attract new sources of funding by 
demonstrating and evidencing that your organisation is effective and impactful.
Shows what’s effective and what’s not (so)  effective in your organisation’s activities.  This can include stopping legacy activities that aren’t actually impactful.
Engage new and existing partners who are aligned to the impact you’re seeking.
Use social impact measurement to embed a  culture that focuses on results and the 
rather than activities and looking busy.
Strengthen your reputation as impactful,  honest and effective through taking an evidence-based, transparent approach. 
What makes up an impact measurement framework?
At Spark, our approach to impact measurement includes two key elements: a theory of change and an impact measurement framework. We’ve explained both of these below.
A theory of change maps the logic underpinning your impact measurement. It defines the problems and challenges you exist to solve (the context), how you go about solving these challenges (your activities) and the resulting medium and long-term change (your outcomes and impact). While different people use different terms within their theory of change, it’s generally structured as context > activities > outcomes > impact. Some organisations also include ‘inputs’ between the context and activities sections and ‘outputs’ between the activities and outcomes sections.
We’ve provided additional detail on the theory of change and its components later in this article. If you’d like to deep dive into the theory of change, you can also download our free whitepaper about the theory of change
An impact measurement framework builds on your theory of change by identifying the data you will collect to understand, evaluate and demonstrate your impact. It consists of measures that your organisation will use to evaluate the tangible change that arises from your activities. Instead of an impact measurement framework, some people also refer to this as an evaluation framework.
There are a lot of myths and misconceptions about measuring your impact, which can hinder and hamper impact measurement efforts. We’ve summarised some key fallacies and why they’re not accurate in the table below.
You need to be a researcher or academic to do impact measurement well or at all.
With some training, dedicated time and support, it’s highly likely that there’s an employee in your organisation who can lead your impact measurement efforts.
Impact measurement is impossible at worst and hard at best. 
While impact measurement does have its technical elements and can be complex, it’s also very doable. Getting stuck in, breaking it down into bite-sized chunks, and looking for ongoing opportunities to improve will all help you to measure your impact.
Social impact measurement needs to demonstrate economic or financial impact.
Understanding whether your initiative saves costs and/or is a good return on investment can be useful but it’s not the whole picture.  Focusing only on the finances is limiting 
given the complexity of social, economic,  cultural and environmental change. Bringing in qualitative information alongside quantitative data can be useful in moving beyond a purely monetary approach, while also adding credibility to your impact measurement effort.
You need a large team to develop and roll out an impact measurement framework.
While your theory of change and impact measurement framework ideally considers your organisation holistically, it doesn’t require a large team to implement. Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities is key here. 
Measuring your impact takes too much time.
Impact measurement can take as much or as little time as you are able to give. You might start with identifying and collecting one outcome-level indicator, decide to take a really comprehensive approach or land somewhere in-between.
What’s the relationship between strategy and impact measurement?
We are often asked about the relationship between strategy and impact measurement. In our opinion, it’s a bit of a chicken and egg situation. Let us explain…
As per the cliché structure follows strategy, starting with strategy is generally a good move. This is about setting a clear purpose, direction and priorities; this helps you make decisions about where to focus your organisation’s time, efforts, funding and other resources.
From a strategy, an organisation conducts tasks and activities which lead to positive change. The organisation can then measure these positive impacts and changes.
Our clients are for-purpose organisations that exist to make an impact. A theory of change articulates their positive impact and unpacks the logic of how they create it. Social impact measurement then takes this a step further, identifying the data that will help evidence this logic. This makes the theory of change and impact measurement frameworks useful tools in informing, testing and implementing your strategy.
A theory of change and impact measurement framework can help explore and answer questions such as:
What positive change are we trying to create? How does this look like 3, 5 and 10 years from now?
Which activities, programs, services, and offerings are required to deliver on our impact? Which of these create the most change? What should we prioritise? What should we stop doing? Is there something we need to start doing to achieve our impact aspirations?
What are the enablers, foundations and assumptions that connect our activities to our medium-term outcomes to our long-term impact? Can we influence these elements, either directly or indirectly? If so, which ones are the priority? – What does the data we collect tell us? What’s working and what’s working not?
This means that effective impact measurement can guide and inform your organisational priorities. That’s why impact measurement is vital to strategy. It’s the logic behind your strategy and can help set the focus of your organisation.
Moreover, be mindful that sometimes things don’t work in a linear direction where A follows B. Impact measurement is rarely straightforward. Bringing together different elements, ideas and tools can be really useful. In combination, these points fuel our belief that the stronger the relationship between your impact measurement and your strategic planning, the stronger your organisation becomes.
It may sound obvious but communicating your impact means (more) people know about your impact. Without dedicated and effective communications, it’s likely that only a handful of people will know about your contribution to positive change.
Strong internal and external communication is vital to great social impact measurement. It’s about articulating and sharing data, stories and other information about your outcomes and impact. Whether it’s a compelling impact measurement report, an entertaining video, a pithy social media post or a colourful infographic, reaching the right people at the right time in an engaging way is vital in the information-dense world we live in.
There are some important considerations to think about when it comes to communicating your outcomes and impact:
Firstly, your organisation needs to identify the stakeholders who should know about your impact. Find out who they are and what they care about. This could be employees; service users; community members; government agencies; volunteers; members; partners; donors or someone else entirely. Keep in mind that you need to tailor communications with each stakeholder group to ensure relevance and engagement. For example, government employees might have different agendas and communication preferences than your service users.
Once you’ve identified the key stakeholders, consider which sources and channels they use to access information and engage with others. Ask yourself: how do they get their information? Is it through events or social media? Maybe its traditional media (newspapers, radio, magazines) or word-of-mouth through their networks? Next, think about channels your organisation is already using to engage with stakeholders such as your website, eNewsletter, internal meetings and notice boards, etc.
3) Consider the format and content
If you’ve prioritised stakeholders and channels, it’s a good time to think about the format and content of the information you’re sharing. This is about the length of the information, what information is shared, and how it is presented e.g., videos, infographics, short statements, long-form articles, audio recordings etc.
There are a few other things to remember regarding impact communications:
Use accessible and easy-to-understand language in your impact measurement messaging wherever possible.
Consider translating your written communications into accessible formats such as plain language or Easy English, to make them easier to read and understand for people with low English literacy. This may include members of CALD communities and people with communication difficulties.
Consider how you’ll build in celebration and positivity into your impact measurement communications. It can be a great way to acknowledge and celebrate the hard work of your staff, board and volunteers.
Actively seek feedback on your impact measurement communications to help refine your approach and increase effectiveness over time.
More on the theory of change
A theory of change is a logical model that articulates how your organisation creates a positive impact. As mentioned earlier in this article, outlines the context and need at hand; how your organisation responds to this context; and the resulting medium-term outcomes and long-term impact. A theory of change is an incredibly effective tool for understanding,
exploring and representing your work and impact measurement.
When facilitating a discussion on the theory of change, it can be helpful to start the conversation with the positive impact you want to create, then work backwards to the other components. The reasoning here is that impact is your ultimate goal towards which all the other components are directed.
While the core elements of a theory of change are context, activities, outcomes and impact, it can also include inputs and outputs. We have provided definitions of all six components of a theory of change below:
Below are some common pitfalls and strategies to avoid when developing a theory of change.
Confusing short and medium-term outcomes with the long-term social impact your organisation creates. 
Consider outcomes by asking what you want to have achieved in 1 year, 3 years or even 5 years. Turn your mind to impact by looking ahead 10 or 20 years, or even additional decades out. 
Listing too many outcomes in your theory of change.
Keeping your theory of change simple and straightforward can help increase 
engagement and effectiveness. If you can,  focus on the most important outcomes.  Consider limiting yourself to six priority outcome statements.
Establishing too much of a negative context.
Try to take a balanced approach to the context, considering positives and strengths as well as barriers, challenges and problems. 
Not unpacking the causal links (and associated assumptions and evidence)  between the layers of your theory of change. 
As well as mapping context, activities,  outcomes and impact, it’s essential to look at which activities link to which outcomes.  As well as doing this based on anecdotal information, take a look at what other evidence is out there to back up these causal links.
More on an impact measurement framework
As mentioned above, an impact measurement framework summarises the data you will collect to evidence your theory of change. An impact measurement framework takes the logic of your theory of change and looks for ways to evaluate, back up and (ideally!) prove it is happening on the ground. There are many tools and methods you can use within the framework. The information below provides a general summary rather than diving into the specifics.
Purpose and elements of an impact measurement framework
Ultimately, an impact measurement framework is a tool to determine whether your activities lead to your desired outcomes. To understand this, you need to consider your activities, the outcomes you seek, whether those outcomes are changing for the better, and whether your activities are linked to those better outcomes.
As we mentioned earlier, the key with impact measurement is to go beyond measuring what you do (your activities) to measuring the so what? (your outcomes and impact). As you probably know all too well, it’s generally far easier for an organisation to identify and track activity measures as opposed to outcome measures.
To move beyond activity-level indicators to effective impact measurement, we consider the following elements and questions when developing an impact measurement framework:
What activity or outcome from our theory of change are we tracking? 
What information will we keep an eye on to know how we’re tracking against this activity or outcome? 
Is this indicator quantitative or qualitative? 
Do we already track this indicator or is this a new indicator that we will start tracking? 
How will we collect this information (e.g. through a survey, our financial reports etc.)? Who are we collecting the information from  (e.g. beneficiaries/service users, staff etc.)?
Who is responsible for collecting this information?
How often will we collect this information (e.g. weekly, monthly,  quarterly, annually)?
How to develop an impact measurement framework
We provide more detail on how to develop an impact measurement framework in our free whitepaper 
but, in summary, we propose the following 10 steps:
Know your ‘why’ for impact measurement
This includes asking yourself what you’re trying to achieve through impact measurement.
 Define the outcomes and impact you seek
Rather than starting with a blank page, we suggest starting with the outcomes you are seeking (perhaps referring back to your theory of change). Listing these out can be a helpful second step.
You may already be collecting lots of valuable information. Identify what you’re already collecting, check whether there is any duplication and compile it all in one place such as a spreadsheet or data dashboard.
Map your existing data to outcomes sought
This is about overlaying the outcomes you seek (step 2) with your current data (step 3).
Consider additional data that could help
This is about broadening your data horizons by looking at the gaps in your current impact measurement approach. You may want to look at qualitative vs quantitative data, lag vs lead data, and internal vs external data.
It’s important to check that as well as tracking activities and outcomes, we can also be confident that our activities are actually contributing to these outcomes. We propose considering existing evidence (e.g. your own evaluations and those conducted by others providing similar services) as well as assumptions.
Prioritise based on capacity and capability
Take a look at what you’re currently collecting, what you could potentially collect, and prioritise ruthlessly. Remember the mantra of quality over quantity in your impact measurement framework.
Roll out your impact measurement framework
This might include considering things like human resources, internal communications, technology, systems and processes.
 Communicate your impact to key stakeholders
This is essentially about who you’ll communicate to, how you’ll reach them and what you’ll communicate. Please refer to the earlier section about impact measurement communications for more information.
Review and revise your impact measurement framework
Make sure you are taking a continuous improvement approach to impact measurement by asking questions like is anything missing that would add more value? Are we collecting too much data? Are we aligned to global frameworks like the Sustainable Development Goals, Gross National Happiness or Doughnut Economics? There’s also more information on this step below.
Key risks and considerations when developing an impact measurement framework 
Detailed below are a few key risks and considerations for organisations to keep in mind when developing an impact measurement framework:
While it’s great to be aspirational and try to track as much as possible, going from zero to 100 in your impact measurement can be overwhelming and add capacity pressure. It can be easier to start with a few measures across a few critical outcomes and build from that over time. 
Too much of one type of  data
Some of us, individuals or organisations, lean towards the quantitative (numbers, data) while others tilt towards the qualitative (stories, words). We believe that both have an important role to play so if you feel your framework is.  
skewed significantly one way, take a step back and consider how you could bring in something from the other camp.
You ideally want to embed impact measurement across your whole organisation. Although, there’s a risk that without a clearly assigned team and individual responsibilities, it may not be actioned. The key here is ensuring that employees have received training and internal communications. In that way, they understand the value of impact measurement and their role within it. In addition, people need time and space (and sometimes money too) to undertake impact measurement.
Assuming or claiming  attribution rather than  contribution
Attribution is when you say this (often my) work led to that outcome. Contribution is when you recognise that you played a  part in driving positive change, along with others. Generally,  given social and environmental change is complex, it’s about demonstrating and recognising contribution rather than expecting or asserting attribution. We also have a blog on this very topic which you can access 
When should you review your impact measurement approach?
Your organisation has developed a theory of change, incorporated a social impact measurement framework and is communicating this to the outside world – job done, right? Unfortunately not! In order to make sure it is relevant and effective, it’s worthwhile reviewing and refreshing your approach at regular intervals.
Here are some prompts that your impact measurement may not be working as effectively as it could, or requires a review:
If you’re not clear on your own impact and whether your work is effective.
There’s been a change in the strategic direction or strategic priorities of your organisation.
You’re consistently not successful in securing funding from government,  philanthropy, corporate or other donors.
It’s unclear to your stakeholders which outcomes and impact you play a part in.
Your peers, partners, funders and competitors are using and benefitting from newer impact measurement approaches and technology solutions.
A year or two has gone by since you last reviewed your theory of change and framework.
Keep in mind that this does not necessarily mean a full-scale review. It could be just a few tweaks to enhance your theory of change framework. In addition, it’s important to note that major disruptions such as global financial crises or pandemics like COVID-19 have significantly changed how we live and work, and what we prioritise. At times like this, it may be necessary to reassess your approach to social impact measurement to see if it is aligned with community needs and your organisation’s strategic direction.
Bringing it to life: An impact measurement example
We’ve worked with a number of not-for-profit and for-purpose organisations on their theory of change and impact measurement frameworks. It includes Youth Projects who focus on young people and are committed to breaking the cycle of disadvantage. Their theory of change and impact reports are publicly available. See below for a visual version of their theory of change, and you can find out more and download their impact report 
Impact measurement is increasingly becoming an essential part of how for-purpose organisations operate. In conclusion, measuring your impact is about showcasing your organisation’s ability to drive positive change. It is by using powerful stories and credible evidence. Developing a theory of change and associated measurement framework is a way to unpack, evidence and demonstrate your impact and guide strategic decisions.

meta title:What Is Operating Models - What It Is, Why It Matters?
meta description:In this article, we explain more about the components of an operating model and offer practical advice about how to review and enhance your operating model.

What Is Operating Models - What It Is, Why It Matters?
Read our last whitepaper: The SDGS – An Australian Handbook 
We help for-purpose organisations with strategies for financial strength and better outcomes.
An operating model is what it says on the tin – it’s the model through which your business operates. This includes your processes and functions, digital hardware and software, physical infrastructure and equipment, and people capabilities and capacity.
This makes an operating model vital to an organisation’s success. When it comes to not-for-profits and other for-purpose entities, an operating model is key to effectively making positive change in the world.
In this article, we provide more detail on the components of an operating model as well as practical guidance around how you can review and enhance your operating model.
What makes an operating model effective?
Operating model templates, tools and techniques
If strategy sets the ‘why’ and ‘where’ and business model provides the ‘what’, an operating model is about the ‘how’. An organisation’s operating model addresses how it structures its people, functions, activities and infrastructure to deliver on its business model and strategy. In essence, it’s the nuts and bolts; from the teams and reporting lines required, to the processes deployed from start to end.
The most important element of any operating model is in recognising the interaction between people, process and infrastructure. Designing an operating model is about:
Capturing and communicating the people structures, skills and capacity you require to support the delivery of the organisation’s value creation processes.
Understanding what infrastructure, e.g. office space and computers, is needed to support the people, their roles and the processes they carry out.
Evolving and adapting processes to support the structure and teams created, and further enabling process implementation through available technology and working space
In essence, the above factors all influence and support each other.
The people ‘bucket’ of any operating model encapsulates the structure, capabilities, capacity and culture required to support organisational business model and direction.
The roles, team structures, reporting lines. Often referred to as the ‘organisational design’ of any business.
The skills and experience required across the workforce to meet the requirements of different roles and deliver on activities of the organisation.
The volume and number of people required to support organisational activity. This includes the mix and make up of workforce from FTE mix to days worked.
The values, behaviours and principles that drive the organisation’s practice and actions.
The infrastructure ‘bucket’ covers all of the physical and non-physical assets needed to support the organisations. This is the office space, chairs and tearoom, through to Xero and HR systems required. It covers a broad spectrum, and many organisations tend to focus on the operational infrastructure, i.e. the technology needed to support day-to-day activities of staff.
The provision of physical space required to support staff activities from back-office operations to client-facing environments
This includes all of the software required to support activity from email to zoom to CRMs. This complexity can vary greatly based on the nature of the organisation.
The physical tools from computers to equipment needed to deliver activities.
Any other bricks-and-mortar or equipment required for delivering a product or service, e.g. workshop space; client screenings and appointments rooms; medical equipment, etc.
What makes an operating model effective?
A robust and effective operating model is based on any organisation being clear on the value it is trying to create, for whom, and the outcomes it is trying to drive. The old adage of ‘structure follows strategy’ is as relevant today as it has ever been.
The operating model is very much about how any organisation delivers on its promises. It considers the talent you need, how you fit it together, what it does and what it needs to succeed.
Some key considerations in any successful operating model include:
Does the operating model optimise the skills and resources you have to reach your target stakeholders and meet need?
The governance to make clear and good decisions: An effective operating model is one where decisions can be made quickly and effectively. Your people understand the process and have strong understanding of the rationale and impact.
For many, roles and responsibilities are opaque when looking across an organisation. A strong operating model has clarity of individuals’ scope and the interactions and relationships needed to support organisational outcomes.
Understanding existing capability and future needs:
The operating model highlights the skills needed, the areas of development and increasing demand to inform the future development and evolution of the organisation.
All too often operating models work focusses on the need for new infrastructure solutions, such as software. These should be enablers to the organisation driven by a strong understanding of activities and capabilities and capacity of the organisation.
A primary focus in operating model design is often the relationship between people and process. It is important for any organisation to create dynamic and connected teams and roles.
To support this thinking there are some useful structure models that can help inform and provoke discussion during the process of organisational design (i.e. people structure). Some examples outlined below:
Most common type of organisational structure.
Companies that use functional structures divide their departments by common job functions such as marketing, accounting, delivery and business development.
Work tends to be more formalised.
Tasks are grouped by functional departments
Grouping jobs by skills and knowledge enables greater efficiency.
Allows for a high degree of specialisation for employees
and is easily scalable should the organisation grow.
Functional departments may turn into silos, often losing sight of the organisation as a whole.
Potential to create barriers between different functions -and it can be inefficient if the organisation has a variety of different products or target markets
Companies with diverse product lines may consider a product structure.
This type of organisational structure is common when product expertise is the top priority.
The channels of distribution and pricing structures may also be different.
Companies that focus on superior product quality may consider this type of structure.
Potential duplication of resources. Product and finance managers, for example, may be needed for each product group.
Hybrid of product and functional structure.
All employees have dual reporting relationships. Typically, there is a functional as well as a product-based reporting
This matrix model allows for the benefits of functional and divisional structures to exist in one organisation.
It can provide flexibility and more balanced decision-making, as well as supporting innovation.
May create areas of conflict due to having both functional and divisional management at the same level and covering some of the same managerial territory.
Complex structure can lead to confusion amongst employees.
In addition to how reporting lines mix, there is also a need to consider the hierarchy of the organisation. This relates to how decision-making is informed and shaped.
Organic or network structures differ from other structures as they are focussed on collaboration and shared resources.
Network structures sort their business activities and roles around specific services or partners.
Allows companies to outsource business activities to free up staff to focus on higher-value strategic work.
Allows companies with multiple satellite locations or far-flung divisions to work together as a comprehensive whole.
Can quickly grow complex, confusing, and difficult to manage without careful planning.
Requires clear and accessible information on accountability, reporting roles, and specific business activities for a wide range of autonomous locations working with multiple interdependencies.
High potential for duplication of effort without careful oversight (e.g., multiple locations working on similar products, or multiple marketing departments developing competing campaigns).
A cross-functional team sits in centralised position and supports different functional parts (‘nodes’) such as business units, product teams, or geographies.
This position can be leveraged to also use the ‘spoke’ resources to support a central mission.
The central group will provide an equal experience to each ‘node’.
Increasingly, many companies are moving in this direction. Providing a central guide with autonomy to deliver to the business needs of each node.
The central group is aware of what each node is doing and provides a holistic experience to customers.
Resources aligned to support a centralised strategy and outcome.
This can be costly in respect of central management and requirement for business buy-in and program management support.
A central group shapes and drives the organisation’s strategy. All activity is focused into one business area with functional divisions below this.
Used for those organisations in heavily regulated industries or high brand scrutiny.
Great for consistent customer experience, coordinated resources and rapid response.
Whilst structure follows strategy, not all strategic change warrants a rethink of your operating model. This is only necessary when something disrupts your current strategy and/or business model in a way that impacts how your organisation creates and delivers value. This may include disruptions such as:
Changes in the external environment that impact customer behaviour or your organisation’s operating context (think political, economic, technological, etc.) and that necessitate a strategic shift
Digital disruption that affects how your customers behave, their expectations, or how they access products and services in your market
Environmental and/or social disruptions that affect staff working patterns, modes and physical locations (think Covid-19).
Review your “as is” operating model
Start by reviewing your operating model in the current context, and with strategy delivery in mind. Some questions to ask of yourself and others in your organisation include:
What are the key principles that currently underpin our operating model? This links back to your strategy. For example, a mental health service might have a principle that says, we take a personalised view of each person’s mental health needs. This might inform an operating model based around delivering one-on-one, personalised support sessions in-person with a dedicated team on-site.
How well does our current operating model coordinate people, processes and infrastructure to deliver value that resonates with our clients or customers? This also links to your strategy and business model design.
Do we currently serve all addressable markets and customers with our current operating model? Are we constrained by the current model in terms of scaling and/or rethinking our products and markets mix?
Does our current operating model support sustainable growth and/or impact? For example, if you’re looking to scale up delivery, does the current model enable you to do this in a cost-effective, financially sustainable way? Does the current model enable you to access new or diversified income streams? Does your organisational structure allow capacity to develop critical strategic relationships?
If your “as is” review unearths issues with your current operating model, you may decide to redesign your operating model so that it is fit-for-purpose in the context of responding to strategic disruptions.
When rethinking your operating model design, you may find it helpful to answer the following questions in the context of what is “to be” in the future and how this might inform changes to your operating model:
What are the strategic shifts needed to respond to changes in the external environment, and what are the new operating principles that cascade from a new strategic direction? Returning to our mental health organisation as an example, the updated principle underpinning value delivery might be we take a holistic, integrated approach to people’s mental health. This may mean operating in ways that enable partnerships for a wrap-around model of care, or expanding digital access to self-service information, for example.
Which aspects of the current operating model are no longer fit-for-purpose and how should a new model address any gaps in terms of how your people, processes and systems intersect to create and deliver value?
Do we need to branch into new markets to scale and/or grow? Or perhaps we need to deliver new services or products to our existing market to better meet needs? How will this impact the way we operate and what needs to change?
How might a new operating model better ensure our sustainability? Do we need to look at heavier investment in certain areas of the model, e.g. infrastructure or digital technology? Do we need to rethink how and where we deploy staff? Should we shift towards virtual delivery models? Do we need to build our capabilities in new areas to remain relevant?
It is also important to consider your organisation’s level of maturity when considering changes to your operating model. For example, you will need to review your current capabilities, processes and infrastructure to determine how much change is reasonable and possible in the context of the strategic shift you are looking to make, and your organisation’s capacity for change whilst ensuring continuity of operations. It is also important to remember that your organisation is a collective of people, and that managing change well means being transparent and communicative to alleviate anxieties throughout the process.
Involving key stakeholders at staff, executive and board level in strategy and operating model discussions is also key to successfully navigating change. It goes without saying that it is essential to consult people who manage your day-to-day operations before making changes to your operating model.
Operating model templates, tools and techniques
Operating model design and development is based on understanding direction (i.e. strategy); being clear on what exists today (if it exists at all); and the opportunities to improve and/or deliver to our goals. It is about engaging with leaders and staff that understand, listening and constructively challenging direction and learning based on experience of others and practice happening elsewhere in the organisation’s sector.
The operating model canvas is a visual way to map out the people, processes and infrastructure required to operationalise your business model. In essence, it is a tool for organisational design that focuses on mechanisms for creating and delivering value to an end user, consumer or beneficiary. You may find this tool helpful as a simple way to visualise and build your operations model step by step in relation to value delivery The operating model canvas considers six perspectives illustrated below.
In essence, a process map is a visual illustration that shows the actions of a process in a clear step by step process. The key elements of any process map include the inputs, outputs, steps and decisions in any process. The key to good process visualisation and communication is to ensure that there is consistency of layout and symbols so that it can be followed across different processes within the organisation.
A key element of any process map is the level of detail. Whilst different levels of definition exist and there is no right or wrong answer, Spark tends to approach it as follows:
: Shows the process at its highest level. It is typically five to seven steps and is useful to get an understanding of the big picture.
: Shows the process in more detail with focus on the functional activities undertaken and relationships between stakeholders and their work.
: Shows the transactional level of the process with a focus on the “how”. This is the detailed step by step breakdown of each process.
Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs and Customer
. It is a valuable tool to discuss and visualise an organisation’s processes at a high-level and the relationships between them.
A provider of an input or product necessary to undertake the process i.e. manufacturer.
The actual product, service or decision being fed into the process to enable it to happen
Normally 3 to 7 high-level steps required to complete the process.
The end product, service or decision from the process.
Those who are impacted or recipient of the output i.e. consumer.
The RACI framework is a useful tool when managing change projects. It is a transparent, simple way to articulate who the stakeholders are in a project and what their role is. The chart is a matrix of activities or project deliverables, and stakeholders. Each deliverable has assigned stakeholders who are involved in the process in some way. The roles are as follows:
Swimlanes are a great way to map processes as part of your operating model review. Swimlane diagrams are a visual way to articulate a process and show how different stakeholders or teams are involved at various stages. You may find it helpful to produce an “as is” set of swim lane diagrams during your operating model review phase, and then overlay to identify the “to be” process improvements.
Optimising your operating model is a journey, and something that your organisation should constantly keep top-of-mind as a way to remain relevant and sustainable. Whether your organisation is for-purpose or for-profit, your operating principles should always align with a customer-focused strategic plan. Although it is not always appropriate or necessary to redesign your operating model, continuous tweaks and optimisation should be considered essential to remaining relevant and agile in an ever-changing environment.
With this in mind, perhaps the most important aspect of reviewing and redesigning your operating model is bringing both internal and external stakeholders along on that journey. Your organisation should regularly seek to understand external needs and compare them with feedback from your staff and board to ensure strategic and operational alignment. Your organisation should also consider its level of maturity with regard to where it makes sense to invest for maximum return within strategic timeframes. It is not always necessary or possible to make drastic changes to your operating model all at once, and this is a conversation that should take place between executive and board teams to determine what is feasible and what will create the most impact for your stakeholders and end users.

Facilitation and co-design: What are they, what skills they require and our top tips
No matter whether you have to wrangle 100 stakeholder through an innovation workshop or drive outcomes around a board table, it’s key to understand the different types of facilitation. In this article, we delve into key considerations and skills so you can adopt the right facilitation approach
We’re a highly interpersonal firm so our day-to-day includes workshops, focus groups, meetings, 1:1 and small group interview discussions, and surveys. This means we’ve been brought in to facilitate stakeholder engagement and community engagement for literally thousands of organisations. Our experience includes facilitation of strategic planning workshops with Boards and Executives, engaging thought leaders about the wicked social problems facing their communities, or hearing directly from and co-designing solutions with people with lived experience.
Each facilitator has their own style and approach, which means that great facilitation comes in many guises. Regardless, great facilitation requires certain skills and always has to balance many considerations. With this in mind, we’ve written an overview of what facilitation is, the skills it requires and our advice on how to be an effective facilitator. 
Engagement size: Whole group, small groups, pairs and individual reflection
Attendees: Community or customers, team, partners and leaders
Platform: In-person, by phone or online
The importance of effective facilitation, co-design and stakeholder engagement
Our advice on how to facilitate
Facilitation is ultimately about coordinating a conversation. Typically, facilitation is used to describe the act of facilitating a workshop, meeting, training event, conflict resolution session or 1:1 discussions.
Co-design is the act of involving all stakeholders – such as staff, partners, funders or customers, and community members – in the design of models, strategies and other solutions. Co-design is the short-form of co-operative design and is sometimes referred to as participatory design.
Facilitation can take many forms. We’ve summarised a handful of the components and types of facilitation below.
Facilitated sessions can vary in terms of their focus. Some are focussed on generating ideas, hearing insights and thinking creatively. Other sessions bring people together to reach consensus and make a collective decision. In addition, facilitation can be a means of education and training, through sharing information and building skills. Some sessions may blend a mix of these three outcomes. As an example, conflict resolution facilitation may fit into all three of these categories; participants may share their experiences and feelings, brainstorm creative solutions to the conflict at hand, learn from one another, and come together to decide on the path forward. Depending on the facilitator(s) and the participants, this could take one or many facilitated sessions.
Facilitation approaches can range from highly structured, to semi-structured, all the way through to unstructured. A highly structured facilitated session is likely to have a set agenda as well as specific questions and activities to closely guide what participants think and speak about. A semi-structured approach tends to have some questions or prompts, whilst also providing freedom for attendees to steer topics for discussion to what they think is important. Unstructured facilitation is about participants setting the outcome, format and/or approach of the session.
Engagement size: Whole group, small groups, pairs and individual reflection
To ensure everyone has a chance to participate, facilitators may allocate attendees into groups of different sizes. A whole group facilitated discussion is often a good opportunity to present or share key information and work towards a collective decision. Breaking participants in a facilitated session into small groups can be a means to have more robust, meaningful discussion. Small groups can also be a better platform to hear from people with a quieter disposition. This can be further enhanced when facilitators get people to work in pairs – when there are only two people in the group, there’s nowhere to hide and you’re forced to contribute! Finally, facilitation that involves individual reflection – whether that’s drawing, writing or an online poll – can be an effective way to change a workshop dynamic and suit the different personalities in attendance.
Attendees: Community or customers, team, partners and leaders
Facilitation can be a means of community engagement or broader stakeholder engagement. Facilitated sessions may include a particular stakeholder group (e.g. customers in a particular geography) or a blended group of stakeholders (e.g. team members, board directors, partners and community representatives). Regardless of who is attending, it’s vital for the facilitator to consider participants’ interests, knowledge levels and individual agendas, so that an appropriate outcome and agenda can be developed.
Platform: In-person, by phone or online
Facilitation often happens in-person, which enables facilitators and participants to see one another (and therefore read non-verbal cues) as well as collaborate on activities using butcher’s paper and post-it notes. In addition, whether it’s due to geographic distance, financial reasons or physical distancing arrangements, there may be a requirement or a preference for online facilitation. Remote facilitation also requires consideration of a number of things, including what platforms will be used, such as for videoconferencing or teleconferencing, online polls and online whiteboarding.
The importance of effective facilitation, co-design and stakeholder engagement
Effective facilitation, co-design and stakeholder engagement is a key enabler to gaining powerful insights, making strategic or difficult decisions with collective input, sharing information and plans, and creating ownership of solutions and strategies. Alternatively, when facilitation, co-design and stakeholder engagement do not go well, representatives of your team, community and partners can feel confused, disconnected and frustrated.
Exceptional facilitators make it look like a walk in the park but effective, engaging facilitation isn’t easy. Great facilitators wear many facilitation ‘hats’ and have a range of facilitation skills, including:
actively listening when people are speaking as well as keeping an eye on general noise levels and non-verbal cues.
querying and probing to ensure different perspectives are heard and so that conversations cut to the core of the matter at hand.
as well as asking the right questions, facilitators need to do so with clear instructions around how sessions will be run, who will take notes etc.
grouping insights into themes and playing back key themes throughout the session. This can happen through a verbal summary or visually e.g. through a drawing on a whiteboard.
his can be through the facilitator jotting down key points during engagement. Preferably, the facilitator may assign a dedicated note taker or nominate a participant to be a scribe for small group or pair exercises.
having the physical space, technology and materials ready to go before the session, rather than figuring it out last minute.
keeping track of the session timings and communicating how long participants have for discussions and activities.
if the plan isn’t working or the intended timings are off track, it’s imperative to adapt and find a new solution on the fly.
ensuring everyone feels comfortable and included so they are empowered to participate. Hearing from both extroverted and introverted attendees is key here.
embracing robust discussions, which include different perspective and disagreement. This also includes calling out and responding to disrespectful or inappropriate behaviour. If there is a disruptive member of the session, it can be helpful to talk to them (either in a whole group discussion or separately) to understand and respond to their position. Another good facilitation approach is moving between whole group, small group and paired discussions so that the disruptive individual gets to hear a diversity of views.
for instances where decisions need to be made, moving past differences in opinion to build consensus as a collective.
ensuring that the session is driving towards agreed outcomes and bringing any wayward conversations back to these outcomes. This is a critical consideration throughout, be that structuring an agenda, asking a question or synthesising the discussion.
keeping a positive energy during facilitated sessions by smiling, cracking jokes, sharing anecdotes etc.
In addition, a level of digital capability is required for remote facilitators, which will vary depending on the platform(s) used for the session.
It’s worth noting that these facilitation skills do not all necessarily all need to sit with one facilitator. For example, there might be a facilitator who is asking questions and playing back what they hear, whilst someone else monitors the time and takes notes.
Our advice on how to be a good facilitator
Having facilitated more than our fair share of sessions at Spark, we’ve put our heads together as a team to share our key tips and tricks for effective facilitation:
– make sure you and everyone in the workshop knows the outcomes you’re seeking. These outcomes can be determined in advance or at the start of the session. If you are running a series of facilitated sessions, think about the overall outcome and how each workshop fits together to drive the big picture.
– send any pre-reading materials at least a week in advance of the workshop including sharing key questions for consideration. If you’re running a structured or semi-structured facilitation, have your specific activities and questions ready to go, including writing up any butchers’ paper templates and mapping out anticipated timings.
– set the scene effectively by opening with an introduction, acknowledgement or welcome of country, and a clear summary of the session’s focus. Within this, consider who is best placed to welcome and thank attendees – is this the facilitator, the CEO, the Chair or someone else?
– wherever possible, avoid death by Powerpoint. Actually, try to avoid Powerpoint full stop. If you do have to present something, make the slides highly visual with as little text as possible.
– remember that whoever facilitators generally isn’t able to participate as actively. Carefully consider who will facilitate and if you can, nominate a scribe to take detailed notes during the session. For online facilitation, try to allocate the following roles amongst three people: lead facilitator, note taker and tech support.
– as a facilitator, it helps to use a mix of engagement formats. Have you used both whole group and small group discussion during the facilitation? Would pairs or individual reflection work well in the session? Can you get participants to stand around a whiteboard or piece of butchers’ paper stuck to the wall, instead of sitting down?
– get comfortable with (respectful) conflict, in the interest of building consensus. If there is a disagreement or resentment, this needs to be aired and resolved before the conversation can really move forward.
– during facilitation, encourage participants to get up and move and to take regular breaks. If it’s available to you, have a light filled room and check the temperature of the room is appropriate. (If in doubt, a little colder is better to avoid people getting warm and sleepy.) Oh, and crack some jokes.
Spark Managing Director George Liacos has also shared his key tips on how to facilitate in the below video.
At Spark, we support social change and innovation in organisations by facilitating better meetings and supporting more effective conversations. We believe that being a good facilitator isn’t the same as knowing how to manage people or run a meeting. It all comes down to understanding the tools and structures that help people collaborate.
As we’ve mentioned earlier in this article, a productive workshop requires careful up-front planning, rigorous preparation, and skilled facilitators. Our consultants are experienced facilitators with deep knowledge and experience of team and group dynamics. We offer the full range of professional facilitation services to deliver a successful workshop, from planning to delivery. Depending on your specific objectives, there are several types of workshops we can help you facilitate including:
Our facilitation process has been continually refined but has always remained highly interpersonal and collaborative. We tailor our approach to each unique situation and are committed to bringing the best out of every group. Our creative approach is often supplemented by rigorous research and preparation as well as write-up and follow-through, which ensures that the inspiring ideas can be practically achieved, rather than ending up lost in a glossy report.
Spark tailors the format and content of all workshops, meetings, focus groups and interview discussions to the specific interests and needs of your organisation. Our team of skilled facilitators use presentation techniques that encourage active participation driven by a fast-paced and meaningful agenda so participants leave with a profound sense of purpose.
While we do employ some traditional consulting tools throughout the journey, we prefer not to lead with these. Where appropriate, we take advantage of the full range of tools for meetings and workshops, and select them based on the purpose of the engagement and who will be involved. The below are examples of facilitation tools we find can be helpful:
– a simple format for hosting and iterating large group discussions. World Café involves groups of participating rotating around different themes or questions, building on the thinking of the other groups who have already discussed the topic at hand.
– a tool to generate a large quantity of ideas by combining solutions, products and services from two seemingly unrelated sectors or categories.
– another technique to rapidly generate ideas. The name is the description here as the 6-3-5 method entails six participants brainstorming three ideas in a five minute timeframe.
– a technique to encourage active listening, which enables everyone to be heard. Essentially, workshop participants are allocated into pairs, who alternate between speaking and listening for set time periods e.g. 2 minutes for one person to share their ideas, then switch roles.
Role plays and simulations – an opportunity for workshop participants to practice their acting skills by role playing (or simulating) a particular individual or stakeholder group. This can be a great way to effectively consider someone else’s experiences and views.
– this framework is a means to consider the role of competition in strategy. The competitive forces to consider include the: threat of new entrants; threat of substitutes; bargaining power of customers; bargaining power of suppliers; and competitive rivalry.
– a tool to track trends, disruptions and considerations in the external environment. PESTLE stands for political, economic, social (or socio-demographic), technological, legal and environmental. Sometimes it can be abbreviated to the first four components, which creates a PEST analysis.
– a means to assess the forces supporting and resisting change. This tool was originally developed in the 1940s in the social psychology field but has since been used for strategic business decisions.
Spark’s unique facilitation style and process have proven to bring great benefits to our clients. The use of Spark as an external facilitator equates to an approach that is both effective and non-threatening, and encourages the participants of meetings and groups to attain their fullest potential. Some of the positive consequences of our facilitation include:
Effective use of your time and money
. We help you accomplish more in less time by producing consistent forward momentum and reducing the need for excessive multiple meetings.
. We employ a number of group dynamic techniques that maximise the opportunities for all participants to be heard, engaged and involved. This ties in closely with our interpersonal, human-centred approach.
Taking the power dynamics out of the room
. In a co-design or other facilitated session, you may find yourself in a situation where you have a range of stakeholders in attendance. This could include a funding body, service provider and recipient of services all in the same workshop. It is essential to remove the usual power dynamics (often driven by knowledge and capital) to ensure respect and enable creativity. Begin by acknowledging that every voice is equal, and assign roles in group activities that counter the usual power dynamics.
. As an independent party, we listen and summarise the various statements in consistent ways that give weight to all the different voices, and help to identify areas of agreement and issues that are still unresolved.
. We help generate previously unconsidered, creative solutions that are supported by all members, and allow a true sense of shared ownership. We do this by sharing learnings from our work in the for-purpose sector and by asking provocative questions to shake up the thinking.
. When designing new services or systems that have a social outcome in mind, it is essential that the voice of those with lived experience is at the centre. Facilitation that includes participants with lived experience of a social challenge can drive incredible insights, but the sessions need to be managed appropriately. Assess the risk beforehand and ensure support is on hand if the conversations bring up any challenges for individuals. If people do start to find the content challenging, make sure as a facilitator you’re not just pushing through activities to make your agenda work. Equally, you must acknowledge if you’re not the right type of support and refrain from amateur counselling during the session. It’s all about balancing technical facilitation with emotional intelligence.
. We take our work seriously
we’re serious about having a good time. Our experience indicates that teams and groups who have a laugh together are often more productive, deal with conflict better, and effectively reach consensus. To top it all off, a hearty chuckle is good for your mental and physical health to boot.
Ultimately, facilitation is essentially about creating impactful conversations. As humans, it’s completely natural for us to engage in this way and it can also be a relief that, even if you’re an expert in your field, it shouldn’t be up to one person alone to come up with all of the answers. It’s true that a lot can go wrong in workshops and interviews – that’s why it’s important to prepare well for these sessions, as well as to have a Plan B and C in your back pocket.
Facilitation is a confidence game, so a lot of the time the worst enemy in the room is your own imposter syndrome. The best way to combat this is practice, practice, practice. And don’t let those difficult participants (there’s always one!) throw you unnecessarily.
Being present is also essential and participants will appreciate this, particularly if they see you actively amend your plan to allow a conversation to flourish.
Finally, it’s critical to conclude sessions well. This is about synthesising the conversation, drawing patterns and themes, and asking for feedback. Also remember to let everyone know ‘where to from here’. The world evolves through conversation so, most of all, enjoy the process.
