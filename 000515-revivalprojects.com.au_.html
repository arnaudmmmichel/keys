About / Manifesto — Revival | Sustainable Building & Construction | Melbourne
WHAT STORY DO YOUR MATERIALS TELL?
Through our pioneering work in the built environment, our community engagement initiatives, and our existing materials consultancy, Revival is here to demonstrate, facilitate, and normalise a resourceful approach to sustainable design and construction. 
Stepping outside of convention, Revival is a multidisciplinary practice facilitating projects through a variety of roles, strategically curated to optimise impact and instigate change.
Presenting as Principal Contractor (commercial and domestic), Structural Engineering Consultants (design and certify), Existing Materials Consultants, Joinery and Furniture Makers.
A multidisciplinary practice established with the clear ambition to make sustainable building practice more accessible to everyone.
We are the only Existing Materials Consultancy in Australia, and hold B Corp accreditation.
Our manufacturing facility operates exclusively with existing materials — no new materials are allowed through the door.
We are the only organisation in the construction industry with the capacity to present as structural engineers, principal contractor, and joinery/furniture maker all at the same time, on the same project.
We are registered building practitioners in VIC, NSW, QLD, SA, WA, ACT.
Resourcefulness seems to have been misplaced in our industry;  indulgence has become normalised and celebrated. 
With an unwavering commitment to purpose, by 2025 Revival seeks to inspire legislative change introducing a legal framework around how the industry is required to handle existing materials. 
Revival curates initiatives and engages in projects which serve as a platform to showcase how we propose existing materials should be handled.
We cite the mantra ‘First Do No Harm’ as a concise pointer to the principles at the heart of our philosophy; and as the ultimate ethical compass to reference the impact of our decisions against.
Our practice is predicated on this mantra, it is our compass when navigating our commercial journey, it is the rationale behind our actions, it shines a light on the industry traditions we seek to disrupt.
We approach resources as custodians, not consumers; we seek to support others in doing the same.
We embrace an approach to handling resources in a way that does no harm to people or the planet. 
We believe that the most sustainable materials in the world are the ones that already exist.
We believe that resources are ours to care for in a way that postures future generations to adhere to this same philosophy.
The approach to resource as custodians, rather than consumers, has never been so vital. Custodianship brings an inherent duty and awareness that the experience encountered by those in the future is contingent on your actions now. 
We have been raised as consumers of resource, rather than custodians. 
Unfortunately this defines everything: how we design, how we engineer, how we order, how we build, how we survive. 
The excruciating absence of anyone ever being held to account for obscene levels of waste. 
When we consider how we might handle the existing materials across our cities, in the context of new development; the design and construction industry encounters a poignant opportunity to uphold some kind of distinction between where we are at now as an industry, versus the industry of yesteryear which was predicated on unbridled destruction of natural resources.
Somewhere along the way, resourcefulness as a value seems to have eroded while capitalism-inspired consumerism has given rise to infrastructure and systems which reinforce and reward linear design and consumption… we acknowledge the resulting deficit of skills and values that we now require to survive and operate sustainably.
