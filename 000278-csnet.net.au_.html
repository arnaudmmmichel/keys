CSnet® will support the instruments and surveys needed to bring real time data to your monitoring and evaluation. Use your preferred surveys and instruments to test your theory of change, program logic or other evaluation framework. There is no limit to the options – it depends on what is right for your purpose:
Data in CSnet provides the ‘line of sight’ from ground up data collection to the measurement and reporting of client and community outcomes.
The data we collect is about people.  Data collection must be undertaken in a respectful way. Design your measurement practice to:
Link with consent(s) recorded for the client
Separate case workers from collection of feedback data where relevant
Use single and/or multi program approaches
Balance quantified measures with ‘stories’ and other qualitative approaches
Report on aggregated and activity level measures as appropriate
Alert users to collection requirements for specific clients
Send links to client’s email for direct collection, where appropriate
Collect data once and use it in a variety of contexts – link it to your practice framework, reflect it in relevant reports, link indicators to more than one outcome, and map the results against a range of outcome frameworks.
Security and Privacy of Client Personal Information
Ensure the data remains in Australia, and is governed by all Australian Commonwealth and State privacy legislation
Record client consent(s) for the sharing and storage of data
Use CSnet® security settings to determine the people who may:
Generate reports based on the data.

The outcomes achieved can be strengthened by the quality of practice when working with clients and communities.
Support workers and practitioners and embed the organisation’s practice framework
Structure casework and other activities around a cycle of assessment, planning, delivery and review, based on your framework and with clear timeframes
Monitor the achievement of timeframes in case plans and other activities in real time
Support a narrative or unstructured approach without timeframes or plans if this better suits your practice
Control high risk areas such as individual incident management and complaints with special processes, whole-of-organisation registers, and internal notifications or alerts
Reflect your practice framework in organisational reports for in-house learning, for government, impact investors and other stakeholders.
Motivate your frontline workers to collect quality data in real time, and demonstrate the connection between what they do and the outcomes sought with clients and communities.
