 acknowledges and pays respect to the past, present and future Traditional Custodians and Elders of this nation.
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander visitors are advised that our website may contain images and voices of people who have died
We have shifted our mindset towards the creation of profit for purpose, in the knowledge that our staff are paid a fair wage, that we approach work as part of a balanced life, and that we contribute to a more just society and healthier planet. The following initiatives reflect our willingness to invest profit for good:
, that enables businesses to embed reconciliation principles and initiatives into their daily practice
Because we believe that the truth of this nation needs to be told.
Because we believe that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have much to offer in terms of building our understanding of how to live and care for this land.
Because we are committed to using our skills in the built environment to build a reconciled Australia, where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures are foundational to our national identity and embraced by our institutions.
Our Reflect RAP was endorsed in 2019 and our Innovate RAP in 2021.
The process to become BCorp Certified was long and arduous, requiring us to look at all aspects of our business – from staff wellbeing and wages to the way we engage with our clients – and ensuring that they are delivered to the highest ethical standard. We are proud to be part of a global movement of businesses that put people and planet before profit.
 are a band of businesses that exist to create a fairer and more sustainable world. They must do three things:
Have a defined primary social, cultural or environmental purpose consistent with a public or community benefit
Derive a substantial portion of their income from trade, and
Invest efforts and resources into their purpose such that public/community benefit outweighs private benefit.
Our certification through the Social Traders network requires us to redistribute 50% of profit towards charitable initiatives that align with our purpose. We had already been offering pro-bono and low bono services to community organisations; the Social Enterprise certification formalises this work by providing a framework for measuring the impact of our financial investments.

TheFulcrum.Agency acknowledges that Aboriginal peoples are the Traditional Custodians of the lands in which we live and work, and that the many nations that occupied the Australian continent have never ceded sovereignty of their country. 
Our journey towards reconciliation has involved our staff and leadership team being exposed to many facets of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, obligation and respect inherent in First Nations communities.
Cherelle Wurrawilya, Anindilyakwa Housing Aboriginal Corporation and Heather MacRae, Associate at TF.A
For us, reconciliation is nuanced, contingent and a form of practice that is central to our decision making.
The development of a Reconciliation Action Plan allows us to demonstrate to the communities in which we work, our staff and clients that we are deeply committed to the process of reconciliation. Learn more about our RAP here:

Yee-Haw Money Trucks, Jacky Green 2017
"Year after year mining trucks keep taking the material from our country. The miners cut our river and diverted its waters to dig at the resting place of the Rainbow Snake. Year after year, hour on hour, the trucks haul the minerals away. They take all the Spirit from the country. They take the wealth from our country, leaving behind a huge open cut pit and toxic waste rock pile for us to clean up. They cut-open the guts of the Snake and left us with the mess. 
We hurt when we see those trucks driving through our country. Just like the cowboys scream yee-haw at the rodeo, I imagine the miners riding their trucks across our country screaming, "Yee-haw, I'm rich, Fuck you!"
This artwork hangs proudly in our office.

We’ve shifted our thinking from co-design to the co-production of projects, programs and services. 
We believe that the best projects are developed, led and delivered by communities themselves. Our role is to empower people to take control of their futures and to enable communities to actively influence outcomes. 
We do this by being on-the-ground from the beginning, listening to stories, asking questions and building long-lasting relationships.

We understand that new buildings require an enormous investment in time, money and natural resources. Our buildings are not driven by style but informed by research, the needs of the community and our desire to be useful. 
Our expertise is in delivering community-focussed projects, including housing, community infrastructure, education and cultural facilities, contemporary workplace and homeless shelters. 
We are comfortable designing buildings from the ground up through to major refurbishments.

Our skills in research play out in two ways – first, we deliver research projects and secondly, we embed research in everything we do. 
We are interested in all aspects of the built environment and investigate everything from climate and environment, materials, demographics, character and identity. 
Once the research is done, we compile our findings using a mix of clear graphical imagery and simple text. Our reports have impact because they are accessible; they invite ownership and exchange.
