, a former GE executive and 
 a former Stockland national sustainability manager. We have many years’ relevant experience in integrated sustainable energy concepts, strategies and project implementation.
Presync’s relationships and ability to quickly pull together the right people, skills and technologies allow us to help deliver measurable sustainability benefits.  
, Presync is excited to be supporting the uptake of innovative renewable energy solutions and contributing to the energy transition and net zero targets, now well underway. 
We recognise the potential complexity involved in moving beyond the proven status quo in the delivery and management of energy, water and waste services and in the electrification of transport.  But this is where the biggest opportunities lie, and with due diligence, open communication and a business-case-driven approach, we are confident that together we can build a new, more efficient way to deliver these vital services.
If you pay a large electricity bill, we can help you.
Smart, synchronised infrastructure can help reduce your costs and achieve your sustainability goals without costing you more. A win for you and a win for our environment.
We deliver well-managed projects enriched with deep analysis and commercial acumen. Our network gives us access to a breadth of expertise and range of perspectives and ensures a holistic view of a deeply interconnected future with multiple constraints.
We created Presync expressly to help improve the sustainability of the Australian built environment. We are an innovative company formed to advise on, deliver and operate well-integrated local clean energy and water systems. In particular we focus on the inevitable decentralisation, 
 of energy, starting with optimising the energy performance of the built form.
We are a dynamic team with deep experience and passion for projects covering: 
Net-zero emissions strategies and target setting, achieving carbon neutrality through Climate Active certification, 
Negotiating and contract support on renewable energy purchase power agreements (PPA)

Identify energy, carbon efficiencies and cost savings
Deployed in stages for greater capital efficiency
Reduced exposure to energy price risks
Ongoing support to meet your growing needs
With decades of experience in sustainability, we help organisations prepare a sustainability strategy that evaluates current performance, identifies opportunities for improvement over a realistic timeframe and then develops the pathway to achieve real impacts, such as net zero pathways. 
Where relevant, we take the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as a guiding framework and then look to develop a meaningful strategy, tailored to your organisation which will lead to positive impacts.
We suggest preparing a sustainability strategy in two components:
, which is a communication document which includes a strategy overview that sets out:
 sustainability initiatives should be undertaken, including selection criteria to assess the 
 of the environmental impact, cost to implement, risk (financial, safety, reputation) and ease of implementation 
 each initiative is important and anticipated 
 initiatives can be achieved and best communicated
 initiatives should be undertaken as part of a multi-year program
, which will summarise the current situation for each element of sustainability and suggested future work to improve performance in the following areas

Our clients come from the private, public and not-for-profit sectors. Our professional experience and network mean we are equally comfortable providing practical project advice or strategic advice on the latest technology, policy and regulatory aspects of the renewables, infrastructure and cleantech markets.
There are synergies between the two streams of our work; project work benefits from the latest technology and policy context, strategic work is enriched by current experience applying cleantech solutions in the real world.  
Here are some of the clients we have been working with:
