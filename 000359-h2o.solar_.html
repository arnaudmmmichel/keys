D&D Selected to Present at the Mining Cleantech Challenge! Wish us luck for the 23 rd July
 — Colorado Cleantech Industries Association (CCIA) has announced the 13 technology companies selected to present at the first virtual Mining Cleantech Challenge (MCC). Finalists were selected from an international pool of applicants.
Due to COVID-19, the original date for the Mining Cleantech Challenge has been changed to July 23, 2020. The first call for applications was announced in February 2020 and the second call for applications was announced in May 2020. The MCC is one in a series of Cleantech Challenges that connect large industry partners directly to innovative clean technology solutions. The 2020 call for applications asked for companies capable of working on issues related to advanced materials and chemicals, plant or biological solutions, methane detection, power management, production efficiency, water, remote sensing and tailings/waste handling and disposal, and blockchain.
Submissions were reviewed, applicants vetted and program partners selected 13 companies to present during the virtual program. Finalists will pitch their technologies to major mining companies and investors represented by the program partners.
CCIA developed the MCC in partnership with an internationally recognized team of industry leaders, including Newmont Mining, Ausenco, Fresnillo Mining, Resource Capital Funds, Jolimont Global, Rocky Mountain Institute, Consulate General of Canada in Denver, Clareo Partners, and Colorado School of Mines.

“The Mining Cleantech Challenge showcases the power of bringing together inspiring innovators with leaders in the mining sector to promote technology, efficiency and accessibility,” said Helen El Mallakh, CCIA’s executive director. “We are very excited to host this Challenge series in a virtual format that will further enhance the cleantech ecosystem at a local and global level while addressing industry needs and advancing greater collaboration.”
The Mining Cleantech Challenge will be held on July 23, 2020, virtually. A VIP reception will follow the private pitch session. Registration is open for the VIP reception, which is open to the public. The reception will include a “people’s choice vote” and a drawing for attendees.

About Us – D & D Manufacturing
D&D Manufacturing specializes in developing Thermoplastic Composite Processing Technologies for production of exceptionally large and precise Thermoplastic Composite Matrix Parts.  Thermoplastic Composite Matrix Parts are lightweight, rigid, damage-tolerant and recyclable. We are very excited to be commissioning our first full scale Concentrated Solar Multi Effect Distillation and Dewatering Systems (CSMED) over the coming months. Please make sure you check back on the site from time to time as we will be updating it as we forge ahead!
The CSMED units provide a cheaper and more environmentally sustainable alternative to similar capability desalination and water purification dewatering technologies available on the market today (such as Reverse Osmosis).
The units provide customers with the opportunity to either remove a certain percentage of distilled water from the fluid source in order to increase the concentrated Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) of the feed stock, or to separate and distill up to 100% of the available water by taking the residue to Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) and leaving only the solids behind.  Reverse Osmosis (RO) technologies cannot compete with the ZLD CSMED solutions, unless additional infrastructure investment is added to the back end of the RO unit at considerable cost.
Fuel efficient manufacturing processes and the use of low cost material enables cheaper whole of life CSMED distillation costs to be achieved, compared with other similar capability distillation methods. This applies to distilling or purifying water from surface and groundwater sources and for processing/purifying other source water including, for example, urban, agricultural and industry wastewater, brackish bore or salty/hypersaline water, seawater, fracking water and sewage and mining sludge.

Thanks kindly for your consideration and we look forward to hearing from you!
