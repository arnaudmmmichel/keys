meta description:Great Wrap offers Australian made compostable stretch wrap. 100% compostable by diverting food waste from landfill & converting it into the main ingredient.

100% Compostable Stretch Wrap | Made From Food Waste - Great Wrap
                   The only compostable stretch wrap made with food waste
Reinventing the material palette of the future.
We believe true innovation happens on a molecular level, and any real solution to our plastic pollution problem involves a complete rethink and redesign. 
As a team of bio-designers, engineers, and scientists, we have developed a new paradigm in packaging technology.
This technology has enabled us to manufacture an Australian-made compostable stretch wrap for use in the home and in businesses.
We don’t support half-truths or greenwashing and are committed to reducing the number of materials harming our planet.
Carbon building up in our atmosphere and oceans is accelerating climate change at a dangerous pace. On the other hand, our soils desperately need more of it. If we added just 0.4% of organic carbon annually to our soils and gardens via composting, it would offset all global greenhouse gasses released.
The benefits we stand to gain from composting don’t end here — and by replacing all single-use plastic, we could have a profound and positive impact on climate change and plastic pollution.
Shop for your kitchen and picnics.
              Made in Australia by people who care about our planet
Great Wrap solves one of the biggest waste issues we have in restaurants. It works just as well as plastic cling wrap and I no longer feel guilty for using it. 
Such a great concept! So good to see Aussie companies taking steps in the right direction by transforming everyday products that contribute significantly to the plastic pollution crisis
I was so pleased to purchase wrap that is both compostable and Australian made. It is sturdy and easier to use than plastic wrap, doesn’t stick to itself. I will make it my wrap of choice for the future and I’m giving some to a friend that I hope will use it.

We are a materials science company on a mission to end the human reliance on traditional plastics.
              We're the people to do it
We’re Jordy and Julia Kay, the Co-founders of Great Wrap, and we’re reimagining today’s materials to solve tomorrow's problems.
 Our former careers in winemaking and architecture, respectively, led us to Great Wrap once we recognized the sheer impact plastic waste was having on the land. There was a materials revolution happening around us, and everything was changing rapidly — yet plastic stayed the same. We knew the technology existed to put an end to plastic waste — but there weren’t any products available. So we invented the products we knew the world was missing. We are makers by trade, so manufacturing our own products was the obvious route for us to take.
 We’re driven by impact, fuelled by demand, and have a 10-year vision for a world where plastic doesn’t exist.
Since our conception in 2019, we have been lucky enough to have a profound impact on the people and businesses around us.
We’ve been recognized globally in ways we couldn’t have dreamed of, from the Melbourne Awards, Good Design Awards, The Design Files, The Circle Awards, and The Ocean Impact Pitchfest. We are extremely humbled by the level of admiration we’ve received.
We’re a team of scientists, manufacturers, storytellers, and strategists.
We’re proudly creating local jobs across the country, offering a positive and empowering culture for our team and community.
Our Impact Team was built by our dedicated and inspired team leaders who want to see Great Wrap achieve long-term goals that have a positive impact on the planet. They are helping us educate our community about composting, ensure we’re 100% accountable, and reach millions of people worldwide with our story.
              Why compostable materials are the future
The rapidly changing world of packaging is intimidating for businesses and consumers, and no one wants to cause more harm than good. By creating more compostable solutions, we are making it easier for people and businesses to adopt materials that aren’t destined for landfill.
A third of the world's food is wasted, amounting to 1.3 billion tonnes annually. This high quantity of waste going to landfills leads to rising levels of greenhouse gas emissions. So if you don't already compost, it's time to start.
There are many choices for at-home compost facilities, from tumblers and bokashi bins to above-ground worm farms. You can even make your own. So decide what is right for you, do some basic research on starting your bin, and get composting.
It’s proven that you can’t build a materials science company without a team of scientists to support you. This is why we launched Great Lab. 
Great Lab is the innovation and technology department at Great Wrap. They research, analyze and conceptualize our ideal solutions — all based on science. We will always use the best materials within Great Lab and never stop searching for ways to improve our products.
Our Materials Innovation Manager, Dr Marty, is passionate about plastics, particularly biopolymers. With his extensive knowledge and dedication to slowing climate change through materials innovation, we know this department and the future of our products are in the right hands.
We know that our planet reacts to actions, not words. We also know it needs regenerative practices that promote full circularity. It’s important to us that Great Wrap is disposed of properly, so we’re working hard to educate our community on the best and most sustainable way to do it.
Transparency is key, and we have an unwavering commitment to it. Our evolution hasn’t been perfect, and it’s taken years to get our products to where they are. Our goal is to listen, learn, and then act. Continual improvement is a vital mindset, and it is written into our DNA.
We are building a community of people who support practices that profoundly impact the world around them. Through scaling our business, we’ve created job opportunities for these people and shared ownership with them because we know that the more dedicated community members we have on board, the bigger difference we can make.

meta title:FAQs | Great Wrap
meta description:N/A

          What is Great Wrap made with?
Great Wrap is made with food waste and a mix of compostable biopolymers. Currently, we're using a mix of plant-based oils, potato waste, tapioca and pbat. Our material inputs are certified home compostable and food contact approved. In the future, we plan to make our wrap with PHA in our own biorefinery allowing us to process local food waste. PHA is not only home compostable but marine degradable too! Meaning it will completely break down in the ocean as well as a compost environment.
Does rain or water affect Great Wrap?
Some other common bioplastics require intensive agriculture or industrial composting conditions. We want to offer products that solve problems, not create them. That’s why we did the research to develop our patent-protected formula.
Great Wrap is made in our factory in Melbourne, Australia, where our team works hard to manufacture it, coordinate packaging and distribute our orders. We also have our main offices at the same location so our entire team can work collaboratively.
Great Wrap is microwave safe at low heat for short periods. However, our wrap will melt at medium or high heat, so keep your eye on it.
It sure is! Our wrap only begins to break down in a compost environment. It needs the action of microbes and moisture for the composting process to start.
No, you cannot. Please leave that to the microbes in your compost. Although Great Wrap is made with food waste and compostable biopolymers, its composition is changed through the polymerisation process to perform like plastic and is not designed to be ingested by humans.
Great Mate Starter Kits and Nudie Rolls are currently available through our online store. Reach out to 
The Great Mate was designed and manufactured in Melbourne, Australia. We chose to manufacture Great Mate locally so we could control all aspects of the design process and ensure the best quality.
          Why are we using recycled plastic for Great Mate?
Around 373 million plastic water bottles end up as waste each year in Australia, and of all the plastic bottles that are placed into recycling, only 36% are recycled. The rest end up in landfills and spills into waterways, which causes several environmental and health issues.
The Great Mate helps solve this problem by looking at other ways to use ocean-bound plastic and give it a more meaningful life rather than ending up in a landfill.
          I’ve run out of Nudie Rolls, what do I do now?
When it is time to refill your Great Mate, you can buy Nudie Rolls on our website. You can order them in a pack or set yourself up for a Great Wrap subscription so you never run out again.

2. Place your hands on both ends where the logos are
3. Gently push your fingers in to release the top shell
4. Softly pull out each end of Great Mate and pop in a new roll
5. Close Great Mate leaving a small portion of wrap over the cutter
          Why are we using recycled plastic for the Great Mate?
Around 373 million plastic water bottles end up as waste each year in Australia, and of all the plastic bottles that are placed into recycling, only 36% are recycled. The rest end up in landfills and spill into waterways, which causes several environmental and health issues.
The Great Mate helps solve this problem by looking at other ways to use ocean-bound plastic and give it a more meaningful life rather than ending up in a landfill.
          How do I recycle my Great Mate?
Great Mate is made from a type of plastic that can't be put in your home collection bin.
We know that giving plastic a new life feels great, so if you have an old Great Mate or broken pieces that have been replaced and would like to recycle them, you can send them back to us, and we will repurpose them.
          What happens if my side cutter button stops working?
Never fear — our slide cutter button has a lifetime warranty! We're confident in our product quality, and we want you to have your Great Mate for life. So, if the blade becomes blunt or is no longer functioning, we will send you a replacement free of charge.

Such a great concept! So good to see Aussie companies taking steps in the right direction by transforming everyday products that contribute significantly to the plastic pollution crisis
I was so pleased to purchase wrap that is both compostable and Australian made. It is sturdy and easier to use than plastic wrap, doesn’t stick to itself. I will make it my wrap of choice for the future and I’m giving some to a friend that I hope will use it.
