Eco-Friendly Bags: Hessian Bags & Compostable Bags | RooCreate
Bags that don't cost the Earth
An easy eco solution to replace the conventional plastic bag design.  Our Hessian bags and non-plastic eco bags can be printed with your logo or custom designed by our expert designers.

With the rise of plastic pollution across our planet, in our oceans and throughout our packaging,  having the option to choose a non plastic bag design makes a world of difference. Now, businesses have the opportunity to influence future consumers.
Hessian, cotton and jute bags are all the rage. Not only are they environmentally                     friendly, and often made from recycled materials, they are also sturdy and enduring.                     This makes them exceptional for reuse.

Products are designed so that they can be rapidly disassembled at the end of their life, allowing for various components to be reused or recycled.
