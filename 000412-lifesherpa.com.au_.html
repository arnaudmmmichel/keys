We’ve answered some of the questions
you might have in our FAQs.
I never thought I needed professional advice. But getting Life Sherpa® to explore where I could make changes has transformed my life. I was in a small amount of debt, but nothing big. I like to spend money on myself, and didn't want to give that up. My Sherpa gave me advice based on the lifestyle I wanted to achieve – which wasn't the same kind of advice my previous financial advisor was giving me. But it worked. I wish I'd done it sooner.
Amy M, Age 31, Melbourne, VIC
We've always had trouble budgeting and I tried a few online tools but nothing really worked. Then I found Life Sherpa®, I started using their online budget tool which was good but I still need help... my Sherpa told be about the one on one budget coaching they offer and I decided to give it a try. Having a monthly meeting to keep us on track actually finally allows us to save money and get our debts under control. It was the thing that really helped.

Most providers pay a commission when you take out an insurance policy. Unlike most brokers, we pass any upfront or trailing commissions to you, less our capped fee. After all, it's your bonus, so it should come back to you!
You’ll have a chat with your Life Sherpa®, who will ask some questions about your life, goals, and current financial situation. They’ll explain the mortgage process, and give you a realistic picture of what you can borrow – and they’ll also let you know if you are eligible for government incentives like the First Home Owners Grant.
Your Life Sherpa® will find the right loan for you (selecting from our panel of over 30 lenders). They’ll then help you organise pre-approval (which lasts six months) – this means you can go ahead and bid, or make an offer with confidence.
Your offer on a home has been accepted, you’ve paid your deposit, and you’re ready to move ahead. Now, your Life Sherpa® prepares the paperwork to get your loan approved. This typically takes around 6 weeks, during which time they’ll keep you informed every step of the way.
When it's time to settle on your home, the lender will prepare the loan documentation for you to sign and return. Your Life Sherpa® will guide you through every step of the settlement process.
Your solicitor arranges settlement, and you get the keys. Now sit back and enjoy! If you’re eligible for a commission cash back, it will be paid into your nominated bank account every month. Happy days!

Expert Life and Income Insurance with Life Sherpa®
Logging you into your Moneysoft budget tracker account
 Thinking insurance? Let us help you protect what matters most.
Want to protect your family's future, your home, or your income – but need some advice on what type of cover is best for you, and how much? By getting to know you and your individual situation, our Life Sherpas can give you personalised recommendations, and explain all the ins and outs that are involved. We are licensed to provide advice on a wide range of insurance, which we've outlined below.
Income protection kicks in to replace your income (such as wages or salary) if you're unable to work due to illness or injury. Generally, it'll pay 70% of your usual income, and it can be especially handy for those who are self-employed. Considering most Australian companies only offer 10 days of sick leave a year, it can be life-changing – and it’s the insurance Australians are most likely to claim on.
Sometimes called Life Assurance, this kind of insurance pays out a lump sum if you die, or are diagnosed with a terminal illness. Not exactly a cheerful thing to contemplate, but it can be incredibly important – especially if you have a family, or people who are depending on you.
As the name suggests, TPD pays you a lump sum if you suffer an illness or injury that leaves you unable to work and unlikely to work again. This payout is designed to take the pressure off you financially, and it's often used to eliminate debts, pay for medical expenses or fund permanent lifestyle changes.
Trauma insurance (also called Critical Illness Cover), provides a lump sum payment when you are diagnosed with a serious illness (such as cancer, Hepatitis C or HIV), or have an incident or injury (such as heart attack, stroke, or accident). The idea is that the insurance helps you and your loved ones get by while you take time out to recover or your partner takes time out to care for you.

Thinking super? We'll help you plan for the future you want.
Retirement may seem a long way off – but the decisions you make early on have a huge impact on your future. Our Life Sherpas can assess where your super is currently at and make sure it's optimised and on-track to secure the retirement you want.
When you're busy working and building a career, compulsory super contributions may be the farthest from your mind. However, the super fund you choose and the payments you make early on can define your future once you've retired. Very few Australians want to rely on a pension – and if you dream of a retirement spent travelling and enjoying life, you'll definitely need to plan for it.
When should you start thinking about the future?
There is no such thing as ‘too soon' – the earlier you get a super strategy in place, the better! This is because setting money aside is only half the battle. The way that money is invested is also critical – in fact, about $2 out of every $3 you will spend in retirement will come from investment returns! That's why we believe that the best superannuation advice is to make your savings work hard and avoid unnecessary fees and taxes.
Rather than seeking to make a sale (like your bank or super fund might), we simply provide expert superannuation advice at an affordable fee.
We will work with you to identify the right fund for you, help you go through important features for your circumstances, and tailor an investment package to give you the retirement you want with the money you have.
We don't push products, we provide advice
We don't push products, we provide advice
This is key - after all, if someone doesn't understand the ins and outs of your exact situation, how can they know what's best for you? We take the time to get to know you, and only act in your best interest.
Life Sherpa® isn't aligned with any insurance providers – so we're free to look at hundreds of different insurance options, and to recommend the right one specifically for you.
We're by your side from start to finish
We're by your side from start to finish
From your initial application, right through to approval and beyond, your Life Sherpa® will guide and support you every step of the way. What's more, we'll be there for you when time comes to claim on your policy.

Most providers pay a commission when you take out an insurance policy. Unlike most brokers, we pass any upfront or trailing commissions to you, less our capped fee. After all, it's your bonus, so it should come back to you!
Talk to your Life Sherpa® about your plans, your goals, time horizon, and attitude to risk. From there you can design an investment strategy that's right for you.
Your Life Sherpa® will work with you to determine the right structure, provider and investment options, help you achieve the balance between cost, performance and transparency, and will give you an easy to read report with an overview of their recommendations.
Your Life Sherpa® then prepares the paperwork to get your funds invested the right way.
Keeping you and your super on track
Investing right is just the first step. Your investment need ongoing nurturing, so your Life Sherpa® will keep an eye on it, give you regular updates, adjust for market and product changes and make sure that any changes to your circumstances or goals are considered. The cost of this is usually tax deductible.
Now sit back and relax, knowing your investment is in safe hands and working hard for you.

How it works - Life Sherpa®
Logging you into your Moneysoft budget tracker account
There are plenty of banks, brokers and institutions out there, all promising that their home loan, bank product or investment is the ’best’. But how many are offering meaningful advice that’s in your best interests alone?
This is where our team of Life Sherpas comes in. All highly experienced, qualified finance professionals, our Life Sherpas not only give you world-class financial advice – they connect you to the solution or product that is right for you. Our Life Sherpas are available ‘on demand’ so you can access the guidance you need, when you need it most.
And best of all, we’ll only ever receive a transparent capped fee from any commissions, and give you back the rest of any upfront or trailing commissions!
There are five main areas we cover, correlating with the times in life when we tend to make big, important decisions. And don’t worry – you don’t have to pay to be a Life Sherpa® member to access the tools and resources or to get help with insurance or home loans.
Looking to buy your first home? Need cash to renovate or consolidate your debts? Or perhaps it’s time to refinance and you’re not sure what loan is best for you? Our expert advisers can guide you through the entire process, from application to settlement – providing tailored recommendations at every stage.
Want to secure your family’s future, your home, or your income – but need some advice on policies? Our Life Sherpas can give you all the support you need from your insurance adviser – and since we’re not aligned with any banks, you can rest assured it’s all based on what’s best for you.
Retirement may seem a long way off – but the decisions you make early on have a huge impact on your future. Our Life Sherpas can assess where your super is currently at, and make sure it’s optimised and on track to secure the retirement you want.
With decades of experience in finance, our Life Sherpa® advisers can help you navigate the complex, ever-changing world of investment. From advising you on property investments, to explaining the nuances of the stock market, we’re here to ensure your investments really work for you.
When it comes to being money-savvy, a little education can go a long way — in fact, it can be life-changing.  Our expert financial advisors can help you get ahead with your financial goals.
