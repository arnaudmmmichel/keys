Finance the hospitality equipment you want now and 
hold onto the cash you need to run and grow your business
PAYING FOR hospitality equipment up front can be expensive and put a lot of pressure on your cash flow — the lifeblood of your business.
SilverChef can finance the equipment you need, allowing you to spread the cost and avoid tying up valuable funds needed to run and grow your business. 
You can shop for the equipment yourself, or we can tap into our nationwide network of dealers to help you find it. 
Instead of you spending lots of money up front and putting pressure on your cash flow, we can purchase the equipment for you.
You can rent or lease the equipment from us and pay for it in small, regular amounts with the money it helps you make. 
You can buy the rental equipment at any time; or own the leased equipment at the end of the lease.
After $1,000 or more of equipment funding

You can apply for finance on our website 24/7 or at any one of hundreds of equipment-dealer showrooms throughout Australia. 
We can approve online applications of up to $65,000 within 5 minutes; our funding-approval rate is over 94%.

‘I prefer to own rather than rent.’ 
These are some of the reasons people have given in the past for paying for their commercial kitchen equipment up front using cash.
While there’s no denying that cash payments are interest-free, commercial kitchen equipment
finance has other advantages that could potentially be more critical to your business’s success.
When you pay for equipment up front in cash, it’s money you can’t then use elsewhere in your business, for example to pay for wages, stock, or utilities. 
Unless your business is flush with money, your cash purchase could make it harder for your business to meet its short-term debts.
In contrast, when you finance equipment, you can pay for it in small, regular amounts out of the revenue it helps generate.
This can help your business’s cash flow remain positive.
When you pay cash for equipment, there’s usually no going back. 
If the equipment turns out to be not quite right, your only options are to either live with it or sell it (most likely at a significant loss) before buying another machine, further depleting your cash reserves. 
With Rent–Try–Buy, you’re not tied to the equipment, which you can upgrade at any time; or, if things don’t work out, return after 12 months without penalty. 
Or, if the equipment proves to be ideal, you can buy it from us at any time. 
When you pay cash, the amount and quality of the equipment you buy is limited to how much you can afford at the time. 
Financing can give you more money to spend, allowing you to buy more or better equipment.
This can help boost your business’s efficiency and productivity, improve the quality of your food and beverages, save you time, and reduce your energy or water use. 
Not to mention that the equipment will probably last longer and won’t have to be replaced as quickly. 
Your weekly Rent–Try–Buy payments are an operating expense.
That means they’re fully tax-deductible in the year they’re made.
Cash payments for equipment are a capital expense.
Normally, you don’t get an immediate tax deduction for capital expenses.
Instead, you claim the cost of the asset’s depreciation over its effective life, which can be several years or more.

                Which types of hospitality equipment can I get finance for?
We’ll finance virtually any type of commercial kitchen
equipment that helps your business make a profit.
The equipment must have an invoice value of $1,000 or more (
                Can I get finance approval before choosing the equipment?
Yes — we’re happy approve your finance before you select the equipment, so you can go shopping knowing how much you’ve got to spend.
(Or we can approve it after you’ve found the equipment you want.) 
                What do I need to apply for finance?
$65,000 or less of Rent–Try–Buy finance
, we’ll generally only ask you three things:
We’ll then run an identification and credit check before giving you a decision on your application.  
To find out what’s required for applications for
 more than $65,000 of Rent–Try–Buy finance 
                How long does it take to get approved for finance?
approval for up to $65,000 of hospitality equipment finance in under five minutes (subject to you providing us with the information required and passing an identification and credit check).
If you need more than $65,000, we’ll get back to you within one business day to ask you for additional information; we should be able to give you a decision on your application within three business days.
 finance applications are typically assessed within two business days, subject to you providing us with all the information required.
                Do I have to spend all my finance at once?
The amount you’re approved for is your ‘master-agreement
limit’, which is effectively the amount of credit you have available (i.e. your credit limit). 
You can use some or all of it — it’s up to you. 
If you use some of it, you can order more equipment later using the remaining amount. 
The good news is your master-agreement limit does not expire, and you won’t have to apply again until you reach your limit. (SilverChef reserves the right to reduce a customer’s limit at any time.)
If you order additional equipment and if it’s been 90 days or more since your last transaction with us, we’ll re-run the credit check.
SilverChef owns the equipment and rents or leases it to you.
As the owner of the equipment, we’ll record an interest in the equipment on the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR).
You can use the equipment as you see fit, provided it’s used only for business (not personal/domestic) purposes; and you don’t sell, give, assign, lend or release the equipment to a third party to use without our approval.
Also, if you move the equipment from the location you originally gave us, you must tell us immediately.
If you Rent–Try–Buy the equipment, you can buy it (own it) at any time. If you Lease-to-Keep the equipment, you own it at the end of the lease, after making your final repayment.
* The ATO has indicated that there are several expenses involved in running a business that could be claimed as a business-related tax deduction. For example, if the expenses relate directly to income earned and are used for a commercial (not personal) purpose. These expenses include operating expenses (e.g. rental payments) and capital expenses (e.g. depreciating equipment). This advice is general in nature and does not consider your personal circumstances. Professional advice should be sought that is tailored to your personal situation.

A flexible finance solution that lets you 
try hospitality equipment before you buy it
WITH SO MUCH commercial kitchen equipment to choose from, making the right choice can be tricky. And what if your business quickly outgrows the equipment or changes direction and needs different equipment?
The last thing you want is to pay a chunk of cash or get locked into a long-term lease for equipment that turns out to be unsuitable. 
Rent–Try–Buy solves this problem by allowing you to try the equipment before deciding whether to buy it.
After $1,000 or more of equipment funding
Looking to try the equipment before deciding whether to buy it, including items you're not sure about or think you might quickly outgrow.
Upgrade or buy the equipment at any time
If you buy, get back 75% of your net rental payments — to put towards the purchase price
Continue renting or return the equipment after 12 months
Rental payments are 100% tax deductible.*
We buy the equipment for you
You select the commercial kitchen equipment you want and, after approving your finance application, we buy the equipment for you.
You rent the equipment from us for manageable, weekly payments under a flexible, 12-month Rent–Try–Buy agreement.
You can upgrade or buy the equipment at any time or, at the end of the agreement, continue renting it or return it to us — whatever suits you best.

At any time during the 12-month rental agreement you can…
If your business grows or changes direction and the equipment you’re renting from us is no longer suitable, you can upgrade it.
You can upgrade it to the same or a different type of equipment — as long as it’s standard hospitality equipment with a value equal to or higher than the original equipment. 
We’ll ask you to return the original equipment to us and sign a fresh 12-month rental agreement covering the upgraded equipment. 
The new agreement will give you all the options you were entitled to under the original agreement.
Customers are responsible for transporting the original equipment back to us and the cost for us to clean and service the equipment so it can be certified and remarketed.
If after trying your rental equipment you decide it’s exactly what your business is after, and you have the cash, you can buy the equipment at any time.
We’ll give you back 75% of the net rent you’ve already paid us, which you can put towards the purchase price.
Unlike other lenders, we won’t slug you with an early repayment fee.
You’ll just need to give us four weeks’ notice of your intention to buy the equipment.

You’ll just need to give us four weeks’ notice of your intention to buy the equipment.
If after trying the equipment you’d like to keep your options open or review your equipment needs farther down the track, you can continue renting the equipment month-to-month for as long as you need to (all the while continuing to steadily reduce its purchase price). 
If you agree to rent the equipment for another 12 months, we’ll  reward your loyalty by giving you a 10% discount on your weekly rental payments (
Your rental payments are 100% tax deductible.*
If you continue to rent, you’ll still be able to:
upgrade the equipment at any time
buy the equipment at any time
return the equipment — at any time if you’re renting month-to-month; or after 12 months if you’ve signed a Loyalty agreement. 
If you buy the equipment, we’ll give you back 75% of your first year’s net rental payments and 25% of all the payments you made thereafter — to put towards the purchase price. 
You’ll just need to give us four weeks’ notice of your intention to buy the equipment.
If after trying the equipment you’d like to own it, but want to preserve your working capital, you can work towards owning the equipment over another two or three years (
We’ll give you a 15% or 30% discount on your weekly payments respectively.  
These payments are 100% tax deductible.*
It’s important you’re certain the equipment is right for your business: Unlike your original rental agreement, you don’t have the option to upgrade or return the equipment.
At the end of the term you own the equipment.
If your circumstances have changed or the equipment no longer suits your business’s needs (and you don’t want to upgrade it), you can return it to us when the 12-month rental agreement expires.
You’ll just need to give us four weeks’ notice of your intention to return the equipment.  
At the end of that notice period we’ll send you a letter explaining how to get the equipment back to us.   
Customers are responsible for transporting the equipment back to us and the cost for us to clean and service the equipment so it can be certified and remarketed.
We’ll deduct the cleaning and servicing costs from your security bond, the balance of which will be refunded to you.
Don’t worry — we’ll remind you closer to the time!
About a month before your 12-month rental agreement ends — and assuming you haven’t already upgraded or bought the equipment —we’ll contact you.
We’ll ask you how the equipment has been performing and whether it still matches your needs, and remind you what your end-of-term options are. 
This will give you time to weigh up those options before deciding which one would be best for your business.
Let’s your equipment grow and change with your business by allowing you to try the equipment before deciding whether to upgrade it, buy it, continue renting it, or return it.
Flexibility no other financier, cash or credit card can match.
If you’re happy with the rental equipment, you can buy it at any time.
If you buy it within 12 months, we’ll give you back 75% of the rent you’ve already paid us — to put towards the purchase price.
Rent–Try–Buy’s manageable, weekly rental payments mean your business can get the equipment it needs while maintaining a healthy cash flow.
Instead of draining your cash reserves to pay for the equipment up front, you pay for it in manageable  amounts out of the revenue it helps generate.
If your business is profitable, you can reduce your taxable income by claiming your rental payments as deductible expenses. 
This effectively saves you 25 cents in each dollar of rent you pay.*
Your equipment rental payments are ‘off balance sheet’. 
This means Rent–Try–Buy does not affect your business’s ability to borrow money from other lenders (or any existing loan covenants your business has with other lenders).
We typically don’t require director’s guarantees for funding amounts under $100,000. The funding is secured using the rental equipment as collateral. 
So, if your financial circumstances change and/or you no longer need the equipment, you simply return it to us.

We’re a new business and money is tight. SilverChef allowed us to 
get equipment to make our business grow without leaving us strapped for cash.
Without SilverChef, we literally couldn’t operate! SilverChef has 
freed up our cash to buy more produce, meet running costs, and pay the day-to-day bills.
Being able to rent from SilverChef has made my dream of opening a coffee shop a reality. 
The budget-friendly repayments are kind to the hip pocket,
Being able to rent our equipment has 
allowed us to consistently upgrade [the equipment] as our business has grown
 and not worry about having to store or sell our old equipment.
Just when you think you’ve run out of time to pursue your dreams, 
you’re given a lifeline to do what you once thought was impossible.
 SilverChef was that for me and more.
 it’s the easiest and simplest way to get hospitality equipment installed for new businesses
. The team are truly a pleasure to deal with. As we continue to grow, we will continue to partner with them. 
SilverChef not only provided finance for my new fridges, they were there to help me when my previous fridges blew up. They came to the rescue and got me sorted in no time. 
Best customer service any business could ask for.
I took a ‘crazy’ leap of faith to buy a cafe during [COVID] lockdown. SilverChef has 
made it possible to turn my ‘crazy’ into a vibrant, positive and productive cafe.
 Without Silverchef I would be struggling with the old equipment that was holding me back.
SilverChef should be renamed GoldChef, because that's the service they provide. I feel so proud to show off my new equipment. 
Every day is a great day because of SilverChef
— they've made my experience amazing.
GET FINANCE BEFORE OR AFTER YOU’VE CHOSEN YOUR EQUIPMENT
Find out what happens from the time you select your equipment or apply for finance right through to the moment the equipment is delivered to your business premises.
If you’re like most people, you’ll want to choose your equipment before figuring out how to pay for it. No worries!
Select the hospitality equipment you want in an accredited dealer’s showroom or on their website; or on the SilverChef website.
You can apply for finance one of three ways:
in the dealer’s showroom or on their website 
by calling us on 1800 337 153.
Upon approval of your application, we’ll ask you to electronically sign and return the Rent–Try–Buy agreement and pay the upfront costs (your first week’s rent and a refundable security bond).
We’ll buy the equipment you’ve selected and the dealer (new equipment) or SilverChef (‘Certified Used’ and clearance equipment) will deliver it to your business premises. You’ll then start paying your weekly rental payments.
We’re happy to approve your finance before you go shopping , so you know how much you’ve got to spend.

It can help ease your cash-flow pressures by enabling you to quickly access capital from a hidden source: The money tied up in your equipment.

As the calculator reveals, the net cost of owning the equipment could be as low as 10% (after taking into account tax deductions* and the 
the unrivalled flexibility our customers enjoy and which no other financier, cash or credit card can give them. 
the risks we take by, for example, allowing customers to:
get the equipment they want without having to commit to the full purchase price
secure up to $100,000 of equipment finance — in most cases without providing a director’s guarantee / personal guarantee 
upgrade the equipment at any time without having to worry about how to dispose of the original item
return the equipment to us after only 12 months for no penalty.
                Are there any other fees or charges?
Aside from the weekly rental payments (including one week’s rent paid in advance), the fees and charges that apply are:
a refundable security bond — paid up front and equivalent to six weeks’ rent (less than $200,000 of funding) or 12 weeks’ rent ($200,000 or more of funding)
the cost of transporting any equipment the customer returns to us during or after the 12-month rental period (which the customer pays directly; this cost varies according to the equipment’s cubic weight and the distance it has to be transported)
the cost for us to clean and service any equipment the customer returns to us during or after the 12-month rental period, so it can be certified and remarketed. We pass this cost on to the customer; the cost varies according to the type of equipment and its condition. 
                When do I start paying rent?
Your rental payments will start after we’ve confirmed the equipment has been delivered to your business premises. 
If you’re doing a full fit-out or refurbishment and could experience delays — for example, due to council or construction issues — we recommend you hold off ordering the equipment until shortly before your venue is ready to start trading.
(Equipment in stock can usually be delivered to your venue in 1–14 business days, depending on your location. If it’s out of stock, you’ll need to allow for a longer lead time and order it sooner. Your equipment dealer will be able to advise you.)
If for whatever reason your rental payments start before you commence trading, please contact us as soon as possible.
                When the Rent–Try–Buy agreement expires, will I automatically own the equipment?
No — while your rental payments will steadily reduce the equipment’s purchase price, there will still be money owing after 12 months.
To find out how much you’d need to pay us to buy your rental equipment, please call us for a payout quote on 1800 337 153.
You can buy, or pay out, the equipment at any time during the 12-month term (not only at the end of it). 
                What happens if I want to buy the equipment?
If after trying the rental equipment you decide it’s the right fit for your business and want to buy it, you’ll need to give us four weeks’ notice of your intention to purchase it.
At the end of the notice period, we’ll send you a: 
payout quote to review (the quote clearly sets out how the payout amount has been calculated)
payment authorisation form to fill in.  
If you buy the equipment, you’ll get back 75% of your first year’s net rental payments and 25% of any net rental payments you made thereafter — to put towards the equipment’s purchase price.
                What’s the difference between Rent–Try–Buy and Rent-to-Own?
While they do have similarities, there’s a key difference between rent try buy commercial kitchen equipment and rent to own commercial kitchen equipment. 
Rent–Try–Buy (which is exclusive to SilverChef) and Rent-to-Own (offered by other companies) are agreements in which at least a portion of the rental payments go towards building equity in the equipment being rented. 
The main difference is that, at the end of a Rent-to-Own agreement (which typically ranges from one to five years), the renter automatically owns the equipment.
In contrast, at the end of a Rent–Try–Buy agreement (which is 12 months long), the renter does not automatically own the equipment. Rather, they have the option to buy it (which they can do at any time during the agreement). 
If they buy the equipment, they get back 75% of their first year’s net rental payments and 25% of any net rental payments made thereafter — to put towards the purchase price. 
* The ATO has indicated that there are several expenses involved in running a business that could be claimed as a business-related tax deduction. For example, if the expenses relate directly to income earned and are used for a commercial (not personal) purpose. These expenses include operating expenses (e.g. rental payments) and capital expenses (e.g. depreciating equipment). This advice is general in nature and does not consider your personal circumstances. Professional advice should be sought that is tailored to your personal situation.
If you’re confident which hospitality equipment you need or it’s a large investment and you’d prefer to pay for it in smaller instalments over a longer period, 
 may be the solution you’re looking for. 
It allows you to use the equipment and make low, monthly payments over two, three, four or five years. After making the final payment, you own the equipment.

A cash flow-friendly finance solution that allows you to 
get the equipment you want now and spread its cost over time 
COMMERCIAL kitchen equipment can be expensive and, for many businesses, beyond their budget. 
Even if you have the money to purchase the equipment up front, you risk putting pressure on your business’s cash flow.
Lease-to-Keep makes equipment more affordable and reduces your financial risk by enabling you to spread the equipment’s cost over several years.

Interest component of the equipment leasing payments and the equipment’s depreciation are tax deductible.
We buy the equipment for you

You select the commercial kitchen equipment you want and, after approving your finance application, we buy it for you.
You lease the equipment from us for low, monthly payments over two, three, four or five years.
At the end of the lease, you own the equipment.
Our Lease-to-Keep interest rate is based on your circumstances, including the amount you borrow, how long your business has been trading, and its creditworthiness.   Your circumstances also determine the equipment-value amounts and term lengths you’re eligible for. For more information, please call us on 1800 337 153.
Instead of paying for the equipment in one big lump sum, you can spread the cost and pay for it in low, monthly amounts out of the revenue it helps generate.
This helps protect your business’s cash flow, enabling you to meet your other expenses and grow your business more easily.
The interest rate is fixed for the entire length of the agreement. You won’t have to worry about interest-rate rises if the Reserve Bank decides to lift the cash rate. 
Because you pay the same amount every single month, it’ll also make your budgeting and cash-flow projections easier.
You can choose higher-quality equipment than you would otherwise be able to afford, improving your business’s efficiency and productivity. 
It means you can get the equipment you want rather than having to make do with second best.
The interest component of your hospitality equipment leasing payments is a tax-deductible expense.
If you have the cash, you can pay out the equipment early. 
We’ll discount the interest on your remaining payments (though you’ll incur a modest early-termination fee).
If you sell your business while leasing equipment from SilverChef, you can ask us to assign, or transfer, the lease agreement to the new business owner (with their consent, and subject to them meeting our standard credit-assessment criteria). 
We’re a new business and money is tight. SilverChef allowed us to 
get equipment to make our business grow without leaving us strapped for cash.
Without SilverChef, we literally couldn’t operate! SilverChef has 
freed up our cash to buy more produce, meet running costs, and pay the day-to-day bills.
Being able to rent from SilverChef has made my dream of opening a coffee shop a reality. 
The budget-friendly repayments are kind to the hip pocket,
Being able to rent our equipment has 
allowed us to consistently upgrade [the equipment] as our business has grown
 and not worry about having to store or sell our old equipment.
Just when you think you’ve run out of time to pursue your dreams, 
you’re given a lifeline to do what you once thought was impossible.
 SilverChef was that for me and more.
t’s the easiest and simplest way to get hospitality equipment installed for new businesses
. The team are truly a pleasure to deal with. As we continue to grow, we will continue to partner with them.
SilverChef not only provided finance for my new fridges, they were there to help me when my previous fridges blew up. They came to the rescue and got me sorted in no time. 
Best customer service any business could ask for.
I took a ‘crazy’ leap of faith to buy a cafe during [COVID] lockdown. SilverChef has 
made it possible to turn my ‘crazy’ into a vibrant, positive and productive cafe.
 Without Silverchef I would be struggling with the old equipment that was holding me back.
SilverChef should be renamed GoldChef, because that's the service they provide. I feel so proud to show off my new equipment. 
Every day is a great day because of SilverChef
— they've made my experience amazing.
GET FINANCE BEFORE OR AFTER YOU’VE CHOSEN THE EQUIPMENT
Find out what happens from the time you select your commercial kitchen equipment or apply for finance right through to the moment the equipment is delivered to your business premises.
If you’re like most people, you’ll want to choose your equipment before figuring out how to pay for it. No worries!
Select the hospitality equipment you want in an accredited dealer’s showroom or on their website; or on the SilverChef website.
You can apply for finance one of three ways:
in the dealer’s showroom or on their website 
by calling us on 1800 337 153.
Upon approval of your application, we’ll ask you to electronically sign and return the Lease-to-Keep agreement and pay the upfront costs (a lease establishment fee and one month’s lease payment in advance).
We’ll buy the equipment you’ve selected and the dealer (new equipment) or SilverChef (‘Certified Used’ and clearance equipment) will deliver it to your business premises. You’ll then start paying your monthly lease payments.
We’re happy to approve your finance before you go shopping , so you know how much you’ve got to spend.

Upon approval of your application, we’ll ask you to electronically sign and return the Lease-to-Keep agreement and pay the upfront costs (a lease establishment fee and one month’s lease payment in advance).

The Lease-to-Keep interest rate is based on the customer’s business circumstances. 
The rate varies according to the amount the customer borrows, how long their business has been trading, whether it has enough cash to service the lease, and its creditworthiness. 
To find out the rate that would apply to you, please call us on 1800 337 153.
                Do I have to provide a personal guarantee / director’s guarantee?
Yes — a director’s guarantee is required for all Lease-to-Keep agreements (regardless of the lease equipment’s value). 
                Are there any other fees or charges?
Aside from the interest charged on the finance amount, the only fees that apply are:
lease establishment fee of $495 (paid up front)
early-termination fee of $300 (only if you pay out the equipment early).
                When do the lease payments start?
Your equipment leasing payments will start after we’ve confirmed the equipment has been delivered to your business premises. 
If you’re doing a full fit-out or refurbishment and could experience delays — for example, due to council or construction issues — we recommend you hold off ordering the equipment until shortly before your venue is ready to start trading.
(Equipment in stock can usually be delivered to your venue in 1–14 days, depending on your location. If it’s out of stock, you’ll need to allow for a longer lead time and order it sooner. Your equipment dealer will be able to advise you.)
If for whatever reason your lease payments start before you commence trading, please contact us as soon as possible.
Though the equipment is in your possession, we own it until you make your final lease payment, at which point you become the owner.
As the owner of the equipment, we’ll record an interest in the equipment on the Personal Property Security Register (PPSR).
During the term of the lease you can use the equipment as you see fit, provided it’s only used for business (not personal/domestic) purposes; and you don’t sell, give, assign, lend or release the equipment to a third party to use without our approval.
Also, if you move the equipment from the location you originally gave us, you must tell us immediately.
No — if you lease commercial kitchen equipment you don’t have the option to upgrade it during the finance term.
If you’d like the flexibility of being able to upgrade the equipment at any time, 
 may be a better solution for you.
* The ATO has indicated that there are several expenses involved in running a business that could be claimed as a business-related tax deduction. For example, if the expenses relate directly to income earned and are used for a commercial (not personal) purpose. These expenses include operating expenses (e.g. rental payments) and capital expenses (e.g. depreciating equipment). This advice is general in nature and does not consider your personal circumstances. Professional advice should be sought that is tailored to your personal situation.
If you’d prefer not to commit to a multi-year lease or you’re unsure which hospitality equipment you need, 
 may be the solution you’re looking for. 
It’s a 12-month rental agreement that allows you to try the equipment before deciding whether to buy it.

                                                How does SilverChef calculate the amounts it pays for used equipment?
The prices we pay for used commercial kitchen equipment under our Buy Back scheme (see table above) are based on the equipment’s:
depreciation (using the Australian Taxation Office’s depreciation rates)
                                                What must the equipment supplier’s original invoice have on it?
For us to accept the original invoice, it must include the:
                                                Which parts of my equipment do I need to photograph?
To help us identify the equipment and determine its condition, we need you to take photos of the equipment’s:
data plate, showing make, model, serial number, and date of manufacture
If the equipment is more than six months old, we may also ask you to send us a 20-second video showing the equipment in use.
                                                Do you inspect the equipment before buying it from me?
If the equipment is valued at more than $5,000 and we’re not sure of its condition, we may inspect it. Otherwise, we won’t.
                                                Do I need to give you the equipment’s service records?
Depending on the equipment’s age and condition (as shown in the photos you’ve taken for us), we may ask you for its service records. 
                                                Another lender financed my equipment and I still owe them money — is it eligible for Buy Back?
No — we only buy equipment that is unencumbered, i.e. not being used as security or collateral for an outstanding loan. 
So we can get an idea of your equipment’s market value, please tell us a bit about it. 
We'll get back to you within one business day.
