The environmental benefits attached to WFH
It goes without saying, you’re always more conscious of your power and gas consumption when the bill is coming out of your own pocket. Without the need to regulate office temperatures and use excessive electricity outputs, we can see consumption reduce almost by half, according to Sun Microsystems study.
With the pantry and fridge only steps away, and coffee available by the pot, we can see the temptation of takeaway food & drinks diminish. Single-use products such as cups, cutlery, containers, cling wrap, plastic bags, sauce sachets and cutlery are replaced with your reusable dishes - just make sure you wash them in eco-friendly products ;)
Removing the commute to and from work each day reduces fuel usage, reduces air pollution, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Global Workforce Analytics, estimates that working from home half the week can reduce emissions by 54 million tons every year.
We’re a group of nice people who like working with other nice people to make positive change.
Nick is the founder of Freerange Future. With more than twenty years working across diverse roles and projects in the creative industries, Nick now divides his time between leading Freerange and consulting to our beloved clients. Nick gets out of bed every day to champion values and purpose, and how these permeate through every aspect of an authentic organisation.
Outside of work Nick is happiest relaxing or exploring with his family and very early in the morning is likely to be up and editing his first novel. He is also a board member of the Adelaide Festival of Ideas Association.
With a background in traditional advertising agencies, Alicia is happy to have converted to the “light side” and has been with Freerange for five years. Alicia has experience in Australia and the UK with global brands through to sole operators, so she has almost seen it all! She loves strategy and coming up with creative ways to communicate.
Outside of work, Alicia spends most of her waking hours alongside her staffy x bull terrier x lab x german shepherd x SAUSAGE DOG, Raz. She’s passionate about lots of things but in particular equality and Women’s rights. Her last meal on earth would be FULL of gluten, being intolerant leaves a big hole in her foodie heart. Fun fact, she knows the lyrics to just about any 80’s or 90’s pop song, yet can’t remember how to speak French (after studying it for 14 years). Would you take her on in a Karaoke battle?
Always ensuring the cogs are turning smoothly, India is a dynamic manager and designer, running the studio admin and seeing through projects from strategy to implementation. From resource planning, keeping budgets on track, and improving processes to producing high quality designs from concept through to final artwork, she is always two steps ahead in supporting team members and clients.
Indie has relocated to her hometown of Renmark, where she loves catching up with her family and spending time down the river. An abundance of plants fill her home, to which she definitely takes the title of greenest thumb in Freerange. In her spare time, Indie loves travelling and has a passion for photography (let it be noted, not of the selfie variety). She’s also a master cake baker and decorator, putting us all to shame at birthdays when it’s our turn to bring the cake. Need some cake-spiration? Ask Indie to send through some of her masterpieces!
Hermie is a WordPress whizz and expert in implementing responsive layouts for both email and web. He relishes every challenge thrown at him by the design team.
An outdoor introvert, Hermie really loves travelling, but only in small crowds of course. He’s not really into TV shows and can rarely finish a movie, but music is what really makes him sway. Always on trend, his favourite colour is black, from the way he takes his coffee to his almost entirely black wardrobe. If he could choose any one meal on Earth, it would be buffalo wings and maybe a paddle of different craft beers.
Rosyn is an expert in the digital landscape, with a wealth of experience in crafting websites and user experiences for a vast range of clients and needs. From brainstorming solutions and deconstructing user interactions, to putting thoughtful and accessible designs together, she is passionate about producing work that people connect with. 
When Rosyn isn’t working, she’s out exploring nature and looking for new hiking trails or cooking up a vegan storm in the kitchen. She is passionate about conservation and is an active volunteer with Sea Shepherd, even spending 9 months aboard the Steve Irwin ship as a deckhand. When COVID hit, Rosyn’s move to Canada was put on hold, but she made the most of it and bought a van and travelled around Australia with her partner, working all the way around. Want to know her guilty pleasure? Binge watching Ru Paul’s Drag Race on the couch with an assortment of snacks and a glass of red.
From start-ups to large organisations, Laura has helped a diverse range of companies transform their marketing. She loves all things marketing, but particularly digital marketing and market research. 
She is passionate about deeply understanding the marketing problem, developing strategy based on data and customer feedback, and implementing marketing strategies that make an impact. She is both a creative and analytical thinker who thrives on finding new ways to solve problems. 
Outside of work you might find her at the beach or the local creek with her young family. She’s also a mid century enthusiast, recently ticking off one of her goals to save and renovate a mid century home.
With a strong passion for graphic design, Helena has over 9 years of experience across a diverse range of areas including branding, packaging, print and digital design and retail marketing. She enjoys thinking creatively to develop design solutions that are both an effective piece of communication while also being aesthetically pleasing.
Outside of work, you’ll find Helena spending time outdoors, going for hikes, bike rides or walking her Cocker Spaniel, Louie. She enjoys regularly participating in her local Parkrun as well as bringing her creative skills to the kitchen whenever she has time!

Rebrand vs refresh; what is right for you?
A cohesive and compelling brand can make or break your company. Many successful companies evolve with the time, tweaking their brand for different reasons and adjusting to an ever-changing market. And yes, your product has to be solid and you have to be good at what you do, but without that initial oooooh you can easily be forgettable. Let’s not kid ourselves, we all eat with our eyes first. After we are visually pleased, we can go on to devour all the other elements, but that first look sets the mood.
Positioning yourself as a B Corp
 or you’ve been certified for a while, it's important to understand how to position yourself as a B Corp. We recognise we’re on this journey ourselves and we don’t always do it perfectly, so we asked some of our fellow B Corps to share their thoughts and experiences too!
, Freerange Future’s pledge to use our expertise to ‘help those doing good become great’. It quickly led to two significant questions – how do we decide what’s good, and how can we be (more) good ourselves?
It's National Volunteers Week, a week to celebrate all the wonderful work that volunteers do to make the world better for everyone! We asked three Freerangers to share their favourite volunteering stories.

Working Women's Centre - Freerange Future
The Working Women’s Centre is a group of fiercely passionate women advocating for and supporting working women in South Australia. The incredible free service allows all women, particularly those in vulnerable or disadvantaged situations, the opportunity to fight for their fair work rights.
WWC approached Freerange Future to work with their team to bring their dated brand into the 21st century and create a website that effectively communicates who they are, what they do and how they have helped working women in our state.
WWC wanted their brand to reflect their rich history, a passionate personality (aka kick ass attitude) and to be able to hold its ground in the corporate world.  The result is a simple brandmark that represents women working together, a bold colour palette, a fresh typeface with a nod to their rich history and beautiful hand drawn illustrations.
Their new website is spacious, accessible, approachable and engaging. But the best part – the strategy, design and development process was 100% run by our very own team of fierce women. F**k yeah!

It’s a rigorous accreditation process that measures an organisation’s environmental and social impact, worker, supplier and community relations as well its governance. Businesses that achieve a minimum benchmark of 80 points are accredited as B Corps.
For-profit businesses of all kinds can become accredited. The B Corp community includes B2B and B2C companies; clothing, fast moving consumer goods, property developers, banks, lawyers, superannuation funds and numerous consultants. These diverse organisations all have something in common, a belief in business as a force for good.
Why did Freerange Future become a B Corp Creative Agency?
We want to be good as well as helping our clients do good. The B Impact Assessment is a thorough process that gives us a roadmap for being more good. There are many small improvements we can make to our business practices over the coming years as we improve our B Impact rating.
Why should I choose a B Corp?
Just as you might choose a Fairtrade labeled product, choosing to buy or procure from a B Corp gives you the confidence that the organisation has an ethical approach to business and they don’t put profit ahead of everything else. B Corps consider the environment, their staff, suppliers and community when they do business.
Over 2,000 business around the world are accredited B Corps. There are around 150 in Australia. These are some of our favourite B Corps:
How can I become a B Corp?

Even if you don’t intend to become a B Corp, going through the assessment offers many insights into your organisation’s processes and impact as well as numerous ways you can improve.
