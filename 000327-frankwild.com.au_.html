We are leaders in the measurement and Â reduction of carbon impact for the event industry. We offer a unique impact assessment calculator designed specifically for events and Climate Active Carbon Neutral Certification.
We go beyond sustainability to develop circular solutions. We take a good look at the lifecycle of every asset and apply clever design to reduce impact at each point.
We have developed an event-specific system which calculates the environmental impact of our projects. We then determine the best ways to reduce impact before offsetting what remains.
We dig clever design that focuses on minimal impact. Our design approach results in reduced waste, increased materials efficiency and extending the life of products through reuse and repurposing.
Frank Wild respectfully acknowledge the Wurundjeri People, and their Elders past, present and future who are the True Custodians of the land on which we create.
