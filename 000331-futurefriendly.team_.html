Future Friendly Team Pty Ltd has been acquired by Ernst & Young, Australia. 
We exist to build a better future.
For 17 years, we have built, launched, and invested in products and services that make a difference.
 On 7 August Future Friendly joined the EY Australia team to lead a new business transformation offering.
The way we design everyday services can change lives.
Our biggest challenges are all affected by the products and services we use everyday.
Climate change, financial wellbeing, mental health, diversity and inclusion, education, housing stability and rising cost of living.
Improving the design of everyday services leads to positive change at scale.
“It's the everyday products that make the biggest difference. Small changes can change lives. Our role is to help organisations make their good intentions real.”

Future Friendly (Formerly Mentally Friendly) - Digital service strategy & product delivery.
Future Friendly Team Pty Ltd has been acquired by Ernst & Young, Australia. 
Strategic design driven by prototyping & experimentation.
Move past post-it notes to real world progress.
Strategic design delivers immediate progress & lasting value.
Time is short. Organisations can't afford to continue to fund design that doesn't translate into benefits today.
Create immediate progress towards your goals.
Quick wins aren't enough. Today's progress is only valuable when it's sustainable.
Create lasting value for the future.
The only way to solve a problem is together.
We see ourselves as an extension of the organisations we work for. Our role is to augment your teams with hard skills, category expertise, and an outside perspective.
We work on-site (or together, remotely), and check in every second day to show progress and get feedback. 
Human centered means building empathy with people and designing with communities.
 But it also means delivering results to those communities - making decisions quickly that resonate, creating feedback loops and improving.
Our most senior team members are all active practitioners, and work full-time on projects.
Teams benefit from their deep domain expertise, and years of experience – driving immediate progress.
The only way to build evidence in a solution is to make it and test it.
We build working prototypes in the first 2 weeks of a project, and test with at least 5 customers every sprint.
We’ll work alongside your teams to deliver project outputs and up-skill along the way.
We record and teach what works with simple playbooks, so your teams can take it forward.
We bring deep subject-matter expertise, combined with the practical hands-on skills needed to deliver.
The future isn't something you wait for.

Future Friendly (Formerly Mentally Friendly) - Digital service strategy & product delivery.
Future Friendly Team Pty Ltd has been acquired by Ernst & Young, Australia. 
We started out wanting to create a studio we wanted to work for. To focus on the quality of life for the people that work here and the impact of the work we create.
As a studio, we exist to create change in the systems and institutions we all use every day — spanning finance, education, government and mental health. We are energised by solving the complex and challenging problems, working closely with the communities they affect, and bringing momentum to deliver immediate value in new services we help to launch and scale. 
To do this, we seek out thinkers and makers with diverse skills and backgrounds and let them loose to evolve our vision, the way we work and who we work for. 
Throughout these adventures, the one thing that has remained constant is our ability to reinvent ourselves, put forth new opinions and do so in a way that makes us happy.
Product design at Future Friendly covers the full spectrum — from defining new propositions to designing and launching digital products.
Design for long term behaviour change in complex problem spaces
Iterate designs in response to user evidence, not opinion
Create production-ready designs of new digital products for launch
Developers architect and build secure, permanent and portable solutions, as well as learn directly from the user testing process.
Part of process, not at the end of the process
Use the tech you think is best for the job
Build things that matter and people use
Strategists are responsible for taking an outcomes-focused approach to research, measurement and evaluation.
Contribute throughout the entire project, not just the beginning
See evidence come to life quickly through working closely with designers and developers
Product managers ensure both customer and business needs are met, and support teams to do their best work.
Focus on making things that matter
Influence leaders and changemakers in organisations
Designing and supporting teams are central to how we work — it’s the foundation to everything we do. Teams are multidisciplinary, work together towards a shared vision and have complete autonomy in the process and outcome.
We only work on projects where we can drive positive impact. Our skill is in helping organisations turn intention into long term change. We test with communities to ensure we’re creating real world impact, and help teams measure it ongoing.
We believe people do their best work when they and their families are well. Wellbeing means a culture of support, not late hours; the psychological safety to express opinions without judgement and overall the respect to be who you want to be.
For any other questions or just to chat, 
The future isn't something you wait for.

A platform which makes it easy for NSW citizens to find and access government support.
Service NSW’s Cost of Living initiative exists to ease the increasing financial burden faced by NSW families & citizens.
Collaborating with front-line teams, policy makers, and a diverse range of citizens, we launched a service which makes it easy to access support – giving $1.5 billion back to NSW residents.
Collaborating with front-line teams, policymakers, and a diverse range of citizens. we designed, built, and launched the savings finder website.
Audience validated 3 year strategic roadmap
Development of (successful) Business case for department funding
Design, development and launch of the new website in 3 months
(in the first 6 months alone)
$1.5+ billion in benefits claimed through the website
1.5+ million NSW residents have used the platform
“Thanks to this service, I was able to put my little one into ballet classes that I wouldn’t have been able to afford.”
— Cost of Living Pilot Participant
NSW households are facing overwhelming financial stress, with a 1/3 households unable to access $500 in an emergency.
The Government provides over 70+ benefits and rebates to help with the cost of living, but people aren’t claiming them.
“Provide families with access to an individually tailored one-stop shop service to help them claim NSW Government rebates and refunds.”
— Victor Dominello, Minister for Finance, Services and Property
Disparate, hard-to-find services, existing social stigma, and high-effort processes prevent people from accessing the help they need. This leads to hardship, scarcity, and reduced quality of life.
We need to make it easy for customers to access help by connecting them with vouchers and rebates relevant to them - $550 back to someone experiencing this level of scarcity will change lives.
We designed, built, and launched Savings Finder – a platform which makes it easy to find and access government benefits, as well as discover others they may not have been aware of.
Over 12 weeks we worked with Government leaders, managers, policymakers, and a diverse group of citizens.
In addition to building the digital product, we set up a Pilot team to trial the service in a real-world environment, building service capability and capturing evidence to improve the experience.
To ensure lasting change, we defined a future vision and a 3-year roadmap of improvements – and in mid-2020, we worked with Service NSW to continue building out the product in line with this vision.
Over $1.5 billion went in the pockets of 1.5 million citizens who need it most, including $297 million to low income households. Since launch, citizens saved an average $550/year, with up to $2,000 for some households.
The tool also enabled the Government to fast-track their response to disasters such as COVID-19 by leveraging the same principles and experience to accurately connect citizens to the help they need.
For Service NSW, this project demonstrated how design can result in a smarter, more empathetic, more responsive Government, while generating evidence for real policy change.
“Provide one point of contact for customers wanting to find out what savings they are eligible for and to also apply for those savings.”

ACT Government — Family Safety Hub
Recognising and responding to financial abuse.
We worked with the ACT Government’s Family Safety Hub to co-design a service to support frontline community workers to better recognise and respond to financial abuse, with a follow on embedded and collaborative service model, to tackle the ‘hidden problem and hidden solution’ nature of financial abuse.
We formed a cross-functional team to define, prototype, and pilot a face-to-face financial counseling program.
Hiring and training guides for required staff
Development of (successful) Business case for test and learn launch
Design and build of digital tools to support conversation
90% of people who have experienced domestic and family violence have also suffered from financial abuse.
Despite being highly prevalent, awareness of both the problem and available support is low, it is both a hidden problem and hidden solution.
“Financial abuse is a hidden problem – with a hidden solution.”
The intervention begins by raising awareness of the ‘hidden problem, hidden solution,’ by supporting frontline community service workers to better recognise and respond to financial abuse. Then, depending on the outcome of this first phase, an embedded and collaborative financial abuse service, to respond to a likely increase in demand for services. 
Our process included discovery, seeking out the most impactful space to focus on, an innovation challenge workshop to generate ideas, and design and prototyping to reveal the practical constraints for a feasible, but meaningful solution. It gave us the evidence to move forward to pilot with confidence.
Our process moved from discovery research, to an innovation challenge workshop through to a co-design process, including prototyping and testing a service journey map.
More than 50 participants then attended the innovation challenge workshop, including people with lived experience of domestic and family violence.
In total participants came up with 76 solutions, to converge on 6 key concepts, of which 4 were prioritised to take forward. We then ran a design and prototyping and testing process which revealed the practical constraints for a feasible, but meaningful intervention.
Restoring financial safety can give people the confidence to leave an abusive relationship. It also reduces the likelihood that they will be forced to return to an abusive relationship because of financial reasons. 
The financial implications of receiving the right advice, at the right time, can lead to life changing outcomes for people experiencing financial abuse, from avoiding bankruptcy to keeping their home. 
We have taken best practice from the field of domestic violence prevention, combined with local ACT perspectives, to adapt a service that lowers the barriers to seeking and accessing support for financial abuse.
