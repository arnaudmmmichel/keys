Depuis plus de 25 ans, notre équipe d’herboristes recherche avec soin des ingrédients naturels, en tissant des liens avec un réseau de producteurs fidèles. Nous faisons toujours le choix du bio, de la production la plus locale possible et des produits de la plus belle qualité.
Bioflore n’a pas de magasin physique.
