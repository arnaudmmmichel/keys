As a JUUNOO Master, you will become an expert in installing circular walls and boxes.
Here in West Flanders, we don’t like to brag about things. Nevertheless, these recognitions are an important part of our company. 
In March 2021, for example, we won the 
which is awarded to people who do groundbreaking work in the field of circular construction.
It is not just the circular product features, or the business model complete with buy-back guarantee or even the guts it took Chris; JUUNOO has quite simply brought a very solid product to the market. Even individuals and contractors who don't prioritise sustainability will be won over by the system because it is so easy to install."
Our walls were also awarded the 
, an award that focuses on sustainable business models that can change the world. This is in recognition of the fact that our walls are clean and 
 have a positive impact on the environment. 
The production of walls in Europe produces 174 million tonnes of CO
 annually. At the end of their lifespan, 99% of these walls end up in landfills. JUUNOO turns this challenge into an opportunity with their patented JUUNOO wall.
 also support us because of the circular character of our business combined with our rapid scaling.
we would like to shine a spotlight on our Red Dot Award, if only to thank our amazing team. We received this award as recognition that the design of the JUUNOO walls is solid and innovative.
JUUNOO is an innovative wall system that is easy to assemble and disassemble. The cleverly thought out design makes it a reusable and sustainable product.
– Dr. Peter Zec, founder and CEO, Red Dot
The technology behind JUUNOO is unique. Our product may look 
, but it is the result of years of research and testing. The basic principle, as well as the practical implementation and further improvements, are all protected by international PCT patents.

Ons JUUNOO-systeem bestaat uit stalen modules (of body) die je in de hoogte kunt verstellen tot 5,5 meter. Zo heb je geen snij- of materiaalverlies, ook niet wanneer je de modules bij een volgend project opnieuw wilt gebruiken.
Kies uit verschillende eindafwerkingen (of skins) om jouw wand af te werken. Decorpanelen, schilderbare klikpanelen, herbruikbare gipskartonplaten of toch liever glas? Dankzij het slimme ontwerp scoren al onze wanden zeer hoog op vlak van brandveiligheid, stabiliteit en akoestiek.
Om jouw wand helemaal af te maken, kan je kiezen uit heel wat stijlvolle accessoires. Kies je voor een tijdloze MDF-plint of eerder voor strak aluminium? Zo past jouw JUUNOO-wand perfect binnen de unieke stijl van je kantoor.

Did you know that 99% of the world’s walls end up in landfill? They are responsible for 1% of all CO2 emissions worldwide. That is the same as the amount of emissions produced by all air and shipping traffic combined. In a world where we face global warming, finite resources and endless mountains of waste, we need to 
 That is why it’s crucial that the products we put on the market are circular – designed for recovery and reuse. 
That is exactly what JUUNOO does. We have developed a reusable partition wall that at the end of its useful life 
will not be demolished, but dismantled and reused
. We want to change the construction world into a sustainable market where reusability is the norm.
“I never want my kids to say to me: Dad, you knew all this was happening. What did you do about it?”
If you look at the climate crisis, you can do one of two things. You can either shrug your shoulders, or you can do something about it. I started JUUNOO so I won’t ever have to tell my children that I didn’t do anything about it. 
That’s why my company is called JUUNOO: 
it’s named after my two children, Juul and Noor. 
It’s a daily reminder of why we are doing all this
” – Chris Van de Voorde, Founder & CEO
Convincing people to work sustainably is challenging. Sustainable solutions are often associated with an increase in price. At JUUNOO we want to prove that wrong, because a JUUNOO wall is no more expensive than a traditional wall. 
A JUUNOO wall is a one-time purchase: 
the more often you use the wall, the cheaper it gets. On top of that, you save on installation costs without compromising on quality, acoustics and aesthetics.
What’s more, if your JUUNOO partition walls are no longer needed, we would be happy to buy them back from you with our buy-back guarantee. The quick installation process means you can save on installation costs and minimise revenue loss, because your office can be rearranged in one day.
A JUUNOO wall is installed 7 times faster than a traditional gypsum wall. This means you can arrange your office in one day, avoiding heavy construction work, dirt and dust. 
Choose from a wide range of finishing materials. Fancy something new? Keep the body, change the skin. Replace the panels and create a new look for your space in no time. 
A JUUNOO wall can be installed and repositioned countless times. Simply click the walls apart and rearrange your office. Good for the planet and your wallet. 
At JUUNOO, we are doing everything we can to introduce a 100% circular system to the market. That is why our system walls are designed to be assembled and disassembled several times without any loss of quality. 
To prevent our modules from ultimately ending up in landfill, we offer a buy-back guarantee, which gives you a financial advantage if you sell them back to us. 
Are you no longer able to use your JUUNOO walls efficiently? We’d be happy to buy them back from you!

Here at JUUNOO, we like to talk about the wall that pays off, or better, 
the wall that brings you money
. Because, unlike traditional walls, that’s precisely what our JUUNOO walls do. How? Very simple: you either reuse your walls multiple times or sell them back to us after use. Therefore, the idea that sustainability is more expensive is truly outdated. On the contrary, opting for a circular solution actually makes you money!
Our walls bring you money (yes, for real!)
A JUUNOO wall only needs to be

 to prevent our modules from ending up in the dumpster. Can’t use your walls anymore? Then we will gladly repurchase them from you! This way they, immediately get a new life.
…you can reuse JUUNOO walls up to 30 times without them losing rigidity?
It's time for the circular shift!
Did you know that as much as 
300 billion euros worth of walls is thrown away annually
? This is not only a massive waste of money and resources but also extremely harmful to the climate. It’s high time to take action together.
That is why we have made it our mission to 
 completely. Every product on the market today must be developed with a focus on return and reuse. In other words, it must be 
…the steel in our modules consists of at least 40% recycled materials, and our decorative panels are made of more than 85% recycled wood?
At Kamp, C sits the very first circular building in Belgium. This building integrates as many pillars of circular construction as possible. For their interior walls, they chose our circular JUUNOO walls. It was also the first project in which the JUUNOO x Gyproc walls were used.
