Solar Savings & Performance Management | Solar Analytics
Solar Analytics can access data from a variety of sources. 
Integrating directly with the inverter and consumption meter is the simplest way to connect with no additional hardware required. Currently available with Fronius and Sungrow inverters, and more brands on the way. 
Our Solar Smart Monitor can be used on any solar system to provide a complete range of options and additional functionality.
Solar and consumption data combined gives you the complete view of your homeâs energy profile. Real time data collected in up to 5 second intervals tells you what is going on right now, and circuit level monitoring provides even more detail into specific loads and appliances. Upload your most recent electricity bill to enable accurate savings calculations.
We take the exact specifications of your system and match it to your local weather data to calculate the expected solar production for each day. Our patented True Performance algorithms compare what the system 
 have produced to the actual output. This enables automated diagnostics of faults, shading and other under-performance issues. 
Solar Analytics is constantly watching over your system to provide insights and updates to the Dashboard. Connect to the My Solar Dashboard on any device, anytime to best manage your solar, battery and energy. With automated alerts and notifications, Solar Analytics will let you know when something needs attention, even if you arenât watching.

Our patented algorithms work in the background to provide smart insights in an easy-to-use

For Sungrow, Fronius, GoodWe, GE Solar and LG systems already tracking their 
, integrating via the inverter is the easiest way to enable Solar Analytics. 
For any other system or inverter, ask your retailer to install the Wattwatchers smart monitoring device with our Classic subscription. 
â¢ You have a Fronius, Sungrow, GoodWe, GE Solar or LG inverter
â¢ A consumption meter is recommended for live data
â¢ Or day-behind data may be an option with 
â¢ You have WiFi or ethernet connectivity
- Dynamic control (hybrid inverters and batteries)
â¢ You have any inverter type or AC load
â¢ You have specific site requirements
â¢ You need 3G / 4G connectivity
Wattwatchers smart monitoring device quoted separately by your retailer
Why should you get a consumption meter?
Having a consumption meter means you can keep an eye on how much power youâre using (and when), and take advantage of load shifting i.e. using energy-hungry appliances when youâre producing your solar. Tracking your consumption patterns will also make it easier for you to decide when to invest in a battery
If you need to see live consumption data, a consumption meter (or Classic hardware) may be your best option. If day-behind consumption data is okay, you may be able to access it via Integrated+. 
Note: Our Classic solution already collects consumption data via the Wattwatchers smart monitoring device
How much does Solar Analytics cost?
Solar Analyticsâ subscription pricing can be found on our website 
. You will need to know: 
- The size of your system: above or below 15kW 
- Your preferred payment plan (monthly, yearly, 5 or 10 years)
I already have a solar system. Can I set up Solar Analytics myself?
If your system uses a Sungrow, Fronius, GoodWe, GE Solar or LG inverter, you can trial Solar Analytics
. Note that your system needs to be equipped with a consumption meter to be able to access the full Solar Analytics experience.Â  For any other system brands or set-ups, it is best to talk to a solar retailer who will be able to cater to your specific system requirements.
What if my system doesnât include a consumption meter?
Without energy consumption tracking, your Solar Analytics experience will be limited to performance monitoring only. You wonât be able to understand how to optimise your big energy loads, check your electricity bills or find a plan better suited to your needs. Thatâs why we strongly advise you to check your 
 before activating Solar Analytics. If your consumption information is missing, consider adding a consumption meter to your system or installing the Wattwatchers smart monitoring device via our Classic solution.
Alternatively, if you live in Australia (ex-NT and WA)Â and have a Fronius, Sungrow, GoodWe, GE Solar or LG inverter, you may be able to get consumption data directly from your energy retailer with 
My inverter doesnât seem to be compatible with Solar Analytics Integrated. What should I do?
Solar Analytics Integrated currently connects to Sungrow, Fronius, GoodWe, GE Solar and LG inverters. For any other inverter brand, you can choose to install the Wattwatchers smart monitoring device to access Solar Analytics via our Classic solution, or keep an eye on our future releases. We are expecting to expand our compatible range of inverters and API connections over the coming months and will share new updates soon!
How can I get the Classic solution?
The Classic solution requires installation of the Wattwatchers smart monitoring device which needs to be done by a qualified electrician, and ideally by an experienced solar installer. Even if you have the technical know-how, working in a switchboard has an elevated level of risk, and should only be done by a qualified electrician. They will know the correct model unit number for your home and the safest way to manage the installation.
Do I need a solar retailer or can any licensed electrician install a Wattwatchers device?
Any qualified electrician can install the Wattwatchers smart monitoring device, however we always recommend that you work with an accredited solar retailer for all your solar installation and maintenance needs, who will have the right expertise to ensure that you get the best service.
My solar retailer hasnât heard of Solar Analytics
If your solar retailer hasn't heard of Solar Analytics, ask them to

Subject to the conditions below, if during the Energy Savings Guarantee Period we do not notify the System Owner of the opportunity to save AU$500 in energy spent at the site where the System is located, the System Owner can apply to Solar Analytics to complete an energy savings review on the System. If the Solar Analytics review shows that we have not identified $500 in energy savings over the Savings Guarantee Period, Solar Analytics will pay the System Owner the amount by which the identified savings fall short of $500.
Some examples of savings may include but are not limited to: identifying a System fault, failure or inefficiency (such as shading) that can be rectified to improve performance; identifying opportunities to reduce energy consumption or shift consumption to lower-cost times; recommending a lower-cost energy plan; facilitating the sharing of excess solar to third-parties; identifying opportunities for participation in demand response programs.
The energy savings review will be made by Solar Analytics based on the Data collected by Solar Analytics and other third party databases. All saving calculations are developed with solid scientific and data based assumptions, and the data and assumptions used to determine the saving estimate will be at the discretion of Solar Analytics.
This Savings Guarantee applies only to the original Owner and for the originally installed System at the original site.
This Savings Guarantee will not apply for any of the following circumstances:
Systems which do not have whole of site energy consumption monitoring;
System Owner does do not enter energy plan tariff information into the Solar Analytics Platform, or keep those details up to date;
System Owner does not maintain a valid email address with us, so that we can notify System Owner of savings opportunities;
System Owner unsubscribes from receiving email communications from us;
The hardware used to collect the energy data is not transmitting your Data to us, due to hardware or communications faults or otherwise;
System Owner has the benefit of an energy plan which is not available to the general public, for example a staff discount provided by an energy retailer;
System Owner does not apply for the refund within 6 months of the end of the Saving Guarantee Period.
