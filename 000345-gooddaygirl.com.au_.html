Meet the girls – Good Day Girl
Helloha - we're Alexia and Sophie,
We met eight years ago as competitors on the high seas of independent fashion.
Introduced by a mutual friend we initially gave each other the hairy eyeball but after a night of rocking bad dance moves, we became friends. Respect.
For two years we drank a lot of coffee and shared stories of how retail was just not doing it for us or our customers - we didn’t have her size or we hadn’t even cut her size, yet at the end of the season we were left with stock - it just didn’t add up.
The straw broke co-hosting a sample sale. Sitting in an outlet centre amongst a graveyard of unloved clothing, heads bowed, we thought enough is enough - there’s got to be a better way.
We design for the every day. We like functionality and pockets.
They are pieces that live well, travel well and work together.
We make it differently, taking a slower approach.
We create two collections a year, it’s only available made to order.
You get your size and we leave no waste for mother earth to wear.
We’d love you to join us for the ride.

ETHICAL FASHION – Good Day Girl
No waste for mother earth to wear.
Good Day Girl is creating a made to order world, one stitch at a time.
We are pro-slow fashion and anti-waste.
For our made to order business model to succeed, we had to rethink how our supply chain could work. We had to source fabrics, trims and find manufacturers to work with our non-mass system. We also had to invite clients into a slower world, to wait for their new styles - not an easy feat in this “want and have now” world.
But we found that we were not alone, with fabulous girls happy to jump on board a very traditional way of getting "wardrobed" yet reinvented for today.
At the end of 2017 we were certified as a
 happily joining the global rank of companies that are redefining success in business.  
We greatly admire global initiatives like 
that each year on 24 April asks the question "Who Made My Clothes"; documentaries like 
; Livia Firth is making celebrities accountable through her 
 and local journalist Clare Press has done a tonne of research in her books 
Wardrobe Crisis: How we went from Sunday Best to Fast Fashion
 It’s all about being responsible for what we create 
- produce only what is needed and use what is produced.

Styling Service – Good Day Girl
“If only I could take you home as my personal dresser!” 
Well now you can! We’re putting our 20+ years of styling and design on the table for you to 
unlock the value of your wardrobe
 to suit your bod and your style of life. 
It's time to maximise what you've got!
 You have a slew of fabulous outfits in your wardrobe - you might just need a little help or some fresh eyes in styling them all together. You also might need a little nudge in letting some of them go. 
Easy peasy, we’ve created three different services - 
 - that either work alone or can combine to give you wardrobe nirvana. See below!
We can visit your home in person if you are located in 
“I have nothing to wear!” - said everybody while staring into their wardrobes.
Alexia and Sophie will visit your home for operation 
. Starting with your scarf drawer, we will play the
 game distilling your wardrobe to its best, pure form - made up of styles that fit you, suit you and put a zing in your step. 
If there are pieces in there that still sing to you and you want to 
 donning - we can help you with remodelling. Hem lengths and nips can create a whole new look. Pieces you chose to 
, we’ll usher away and donate to suitable charities. Or you might choose to throw a couple of pieces into the soon to launch 
 - that resells styles to our community in exchange for credit.
A decluttered and edited wardrobe that features your top wearing styles - clothes that fit you well and suit the way you live
An organised wardrobe where you can easily see what you have and make getting dressed a breeze
A new life for some of your clothes - we can assist in remodelling styles and will arrange the alterations with delivery back to you
We will take away your happily donated clothes and distribute them to the right organisations who will benefit from them
Potential credit by reselling in the soon to launch
3 hours of styling time with Alexia and Sophie in your home
Alterations for remodelling are charged in addition to the service fee
 to make your appointment or to ask some questions. 
Alexia and Sophie will visit your home for operation 
. With a tactical approach, we will work with you on editing a season's worth of clothing to get to the essence of your collection - clothes that suit you, fit you and make you feel wonderful. As we go through the editing process by playing 
, you may find styles that you still love, but may need a little tweak - Alexia and Sophie will suggest the remodelling - taking up lengths or nipping in for a better fit - and can organise these alterations for you. 
Some styles might just be ready to go, so we will help you say goodbye and take them off to the most suitable charities for donation. Or you might have a piece or two that you would be happy to throw into the 
 and earn store credits for a later purchase. 
Creating looks for different occasions is key - is it workwear, casual wear, weekend wear, going out wear or a mish-mash of all? Alexia and Sophie will style looks together to suit these needs and photograph them on your bod along the way. We will also take snaps of the individual pieces to then create a 
 for you to have as easy access to your winning looks. Woot woot!
Capsule wardrobe focussed on a season
Defined looks suitable to your needs (work, work from home, casual, weekend, leisure, holidays)
Chic styling ideas, making the most out of what you’ve got and unlocking the value already invested in your wardrobe
 full of styling ideas made from your own wardrobe
A decluttered and edited wardrobe that features your top wearing styles - clothes that fit you well and suit the way you live
An organised wardrobe where you can easily see what you have and make getting dressed a breeze
A new life for some of your clothes - we can assist in remodelling styles and will arrange the alterations with delivery back to you

Styling ideas from your wardrobe formatted into your own Pinterest board
Alterations for remodelling are charged in addition to the service fee
 to make your appointment or to ask any questions. 
Here is a link to purchasing a voucher.
If your wardrobe has been slowly building over the last ten years without any editing - 
 is for you. We combine the mega editing session with the styling session. It's either one solid day or we can break it up over two sessions on two different days.
