“In fact, when you look at the history of the world, there is only one thing that remains constant, and it is: change.”
Air always tried to make perception evolve. For growth. But also, for good. It lies in our DNA. We wanted to move the lines. We wanted to bring more meaning to people’s lives. And we believed that brands could play a role in their lives as well.
Today the need for change has more implications than ever. Our legacy to future generations depends on it. Mankind depends on it. In fact, our whole environment depends on it.
Where our industry partly created a problem, we want to be part of the solution. We can help now, more than ever. We can build meaningful bridges between brands, culture, people and planet. We can help accelerate the movement that will set a brighter future.
Through creativity, we can help raise the bar of the stuff that really matters. We can provide the impact it deserves. We can make it count ...and we believe it can work.
Who still dares to claim that consumption is the shortest route to happiness? All advertisers are capable of producing beautiful images; we must now learn to produce meaning
These few lines opened the first Air brochure, in 1993 (which was still called LHHS after the initials of its founders). To say that they were prophetic would be pretentious. But we have to admit that we were consistent. Almost 30 years later, Air is still a creative, independent agency, and more committed than ever. 
It’s not only what we do,
it’s also how we do it.
Air always tried to make perception evolve. For growth. But also, for good. It lies in our DNA. We wanted to move the lines. We wanted to bring more meaning to people’s lives. And we believed that brands could play a role in their lives as well. Now more than ever, we believe in the power of positive change.
CO2-neutral certified for the year 2020.
We are conscious of our CO2 emissions and by supporting certified climate projects we have offsetted 74 tCO2e. This corresponds to the offsetting of our Scope 1 (heating, refrigerant leakage, company cars), Scope 2 (electricity) and Scope 3 (Upstream emission from scope 1&2, business travels, commuting, paper consumption) emissions during 2020.
air is an independent creative agency that can count on the power of the McCann network.
Independent doesn’t mean alone. Air is the exclusive partner of McCann Group in Belgium. The power of a network combined with the independence of entrepreneurs: Air and McCann is the best of both worlds.

Air | Partner of McCann | B Corp
Where our industry partly created a problem, we want to be part of the solution.
AIR has officially obtained the B Corp certification conferred to companies meeting the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance. The fruition of a very demanding process that mobilized the entire agency for two years. And a logical milestone for an agency that has been engaged and creative for almost 30 years.
CO2-neutral certified for the year 2020.
We are conscious of our CO2 emissions and by supporting certified climate projects we have offsetted 74 tCO2e. This corresponds to the offsetting of our Scope 1 (heating, refrigerant leakage, company cars), Scope 2 (electricity) and Scope 3 (Upstream emission from scope 1&2, business travels, commuting, paper consumption) emissions during 2020.
Neutralising emissions relating to campaign productions
We are aware that the impact of our activities does not stop at the agency’s doors. And although we cannot control all the stages of a communications campaign, we can however help strengthen the sustainability of the production process, for both our activities and our competitors’.
To move forward in this direction, we have developed a unique proprietary algorithm with 
 that enables us to calculate, reduce and offset the carbon footprint of the production process.
Applicable to all our print, film, digital and audio production activities, this algorithm now enables us to neutralise the emissions relating to our clients’ campaign productions and to offer them a ‘carbon neutral’ production process.
The good news, this tool wont be proprietary for long, our objective is to open this innovation to our industry ASAP.
We are always on the lookout for great collaborations—partners with whom we can inspire people and businesses, but from whom we can also be inspired. International as local collaborations are essential to drive our business towards a better, more sustainable future.
 If you have any collaborations proposal.
CO2Logic is our first choice partner for environmental initiatives throughout our supply chain. They helped us measure, reduce and offset our own carbon footprint, but the’ve also helped us elaborate a carbon footprint measure algorithm for digital, print, radio and visual campaigns.
We are engaged to act in the best interest of the people and the planet by following the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that will inspire us to take the right directions.
Since 2021, Air has been committed to the UN global Compact corporate responsibility initiatives and its principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption.
Since 2021, AIR is a member of The Shift, a Belgian platform gathering diverse organizations that aim to create a more sustainable economy and society. Alone we go faster, together we go further.
15 years ago, Air was already advising the International Polar station initiative created by Alain Hubert.
In 2009, Eric and Stéphane joined a trip to Antarctica to open the Princess Elisabeth polar station. This was the first zero emission station built in such a hostile environment.
The fragility of our ecosystem, revealed by the delegation of climatologists and the extraordinary energy deployed to build the polar station have been a real eye-opener.
Air has always been very engaged in Social-Societal and environmental matters. Defending human rights for more than 20 years with Amnesty International. Helping change mentalities towards Handicap with Cap 48 for decades.
However the acceleration of the global warming and the urge to build a better world have convinced us that we should go all the way.
This is where we decided that our sustainable commitment would become an essential part of our business.

Air | Partner of McCann | Work | equal : Join the fam
9 femmes sur 10 ont déjà été victimes de harcèlement sexiste et/ou d’agressions sexuelles. Peut-être ne ferez-vous jamais partie des harceleurs ou des harcelé.e.s, mais vous ferez certainement un jour partie d’un autre groupe de personnes : les témoins.
Pour faire changer les choses, equal.brussels et safe.brussels souhaitent encourager chaque Bruxellois.e à rejoindre la FAM : une « famille » attentive et bienveillante de témoins prêts à réagir en cas de besoin.. La FAM, c’est une famille attentive et bienveillante de témoins prêts à réagir en cas de besoin. C’est d’ailleurs leur règle n°1 : quand on est témoin, on intervient.
Intervenir, oui. Mais comment ? Chaque membre de la FAM est invité.e à appliquer “la règle des 5D” : distraire, déléguer, documenter, diriger et dialoguer. Une méthode déjà connue des initiés qu’Equal Brussels et Air ont déclinée en une série de règles d’or qui, une fois réunies, forment le code d’honneur de la FAM. Règle n°2 : On utilise notre imagination pour détourner l’attention. Règle n°3 : Si on ne sait pas aider, on sait comment filmer. Règle n°19 : On fait semblant d’être ami.e.s si on voit que tu as des ennuis. Ces instructions et de nombreuses autres sont expliquées dans le film de campagne par les premiers membres de la FAM. Elles seront également placardées partout dans Bruxelles pour encourager et guider les membres.

One shirt at a time. One jeans at a time.
JULES changes from fast fashion to better fashion.
Change doesn’t happen overnight. Born in the Fast Fashion era, JULES is the biggest fashion retailer for men.  But today, consumers are more and more conscious about their shopping habits. And if JULES wanted to survive, they needed to change their entire business model. Which they did. Step by step. And the first step was to launch their sustainable label instore. Which we named “in progress” — an easy way to recognize if your chosen item is sustainable or not.
To reflect JULES' path towards better fashion, we redesigned the whole shopping experience with a totally new branding, using “sustainability” at the core of our thinking. Bio cotton bags, using recycled t-shirts as construction materials, the use of local furniture and bio cotton bags — everything has been thought about to create a more positive impact.
The next step was to bring every man into our story and create a movement of men who are conscious, positive, sensitive and ready to embrace change.
Talking about masculinity isn't an easy topic, even in 2021.  Yet, JULES wanted to open the debate even further. That’s why teamed up with Ben Névert, a famous French YouTuber and creator of "Entre Mecs" where a group of friends discussed various topics related to masculinity, such as " masculinity in Advertising", "men and their feelings", "men and their sexuality",…
The next step was to change the way we shoot our LookBook.
We no longer fly to South Africa, we’re now shooting in France only.
And let’s be honest, France has it all. Next to that, every shoot is now CO2 neutral thanks to our very own 
Ok. But actually… What is it to smell like a man?
That’s why we created, designed and launched a new fragrance “Bon Homme” questioning everything we know about what it means to 
Day by day, JULES clothing line becomes more a more sustainable. And in 2021, JULES launched its first 100% recycled jeans. To celebrate this great innovation, we came up with another one. By placing the label that is normally hidden on the inside, on the outside of the jeans. This way we invite all the men in progress to wear this label with pride.

Giving "Liberty Leading The People" a new perspective
A gigantic billboard at the Louvre that enables everyone to imagine new perspectives 
technology can bring to the world
. ( Qualcomm technologies included )
The brand asked Air to design and produce not only the largest poster in France – 1135 m² – but in front of the Louvre Museum no less! 
We wanted to solve the paradox of Qualcomm:
the brand is leading a real technological (r)evolution. And no one knows it.
“Among the museum’s historical/artistic heritage, it was Eugène Delacroix’s 1830 revolutionary masterpiece, Liberty Leading the People, that inspired us. So, we decided to come up with a modern version of it, but from a new angle. Imagining the back of the painting allows us to symbolise both the digital revolution that Qualcomm is enabling, Its position as a leader advancing the world forward, and to give it a visibility that the very nature of the technologies it develops does not produce.
La mode de demain, c’est une mode responsable.

Yes, 10 meters is easy to ride. Except when the future decides to intervene. We took the characteristic move of drunk people and found a more poetic explanation for it: what if it was our bodies trying to talk to us, to stop us from moving forward? Because it knows all the beautiful things we could be missing.
We would like people to remember this film when they find themselves in this critical situation. And help them make the right decision and “let the future hold them back.
