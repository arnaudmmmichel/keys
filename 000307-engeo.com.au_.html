Sunshine Coast |  Brisbane | Adelaide
ENGEO Australia opened in June 2018 choosing the Sunshine Coast as the home for our first office in Australia. Founded in the United States in 1971 and with a strong New Zealand presence since 2010, ENGEO officially opened its Maroochydore premises after opting for the Sunshine Coast ahead of opportunities elsewhere. Over the next five years, ENGEO plans to expand with three new offices around Australia. In May 2019, ENGEO announced a South Australian presence in Adelaide, and in September 2020 the Brisbane office opened.
We could see the growth potential and opportunities that exist when we made our visits to the Sunshine Coast, and that really cemented the decision. There’s a market demand here for the responsive geotechnical and environmental engineering services that we provide. ENGEO has completed all types and sizes of projects in multiple market sectors and it’s exciting for us to get under way on the Sunshine Coast. We look forward to assisting local companies in every phase of project development from the due diligence for land acquisition and planning through entitlement, permitting, construction and project build-out.” 
  Guy Cassidy, ENGEO CEO Australia & NZ
1971 ENGEO was founded in California.
1986 Uri Eliahu joined ENGEO, and became President/CEO in 1992.
2000 ENGEO began work on the Bay Area Rapid Transit extension to San Jose, CA, leading to many rail projects since.
2002 ENGEO opened an office in San Francisco and merged with Anderson Consulting Group, establishing a presence in the Sacramento region.
2006 ENGEO acquired Land Marine Geotechnics.
2008 ENGEO faced many challenges during the Great Recession in the US, emerging stronger and more resilient than ever with a commitment to service and culture guiding the way.
2010 Geoscience Consulting (NZ) started in Christchurch.
2010-2016 ENGEO opened several new offices, including Irvine, Oakland, and Santa Maria.
2012 ENGEO expanded into Auckland and Wellington in New Zealand.
2014 Geoscience officially became ENGEO Ltd.
2017 ENGEO opened a new office in Reno, Nevada.
2018 ENGEO opened an office in Tauranga, Bay of Plenty.
2018 ENGEO opened an office in Valencia, California.

2020 ENGEO opens an office in Brisbane in September.
ENGEO (USA) was founded in 1971. The company was small and was largely engaged in providing geotechnical engineering services for private developers.
In 1986, two new employees, one of them an original founder’s son (and now current President), created big plans for the company and began steering it to further success. They organised the company around clients and in a way that allowed them to be served as they had never been served before. At the heart of the company remained a trademark commitment to always ensure the success of others.
By 1992 the firm had been transformed into what we know and appreciate today, an employee-driven company with a strong entrepreneurial spirit.A place where the doors are left open and the organisational structure is flipped upside-down with the president at the bottom and employees having servant leaders, not managers. Each employee at ENGEO is committed to the good of our company, each other and especially our clients, just as much as the leaders who got us here.
Fast forward to today where ENGEO is a recognised leader for public and private projects of great complexity in earthquake-prone regions in the US and abroad. With more than 300 employees in offices throughout California, Nevada, New Zealand and Australia, ENGEO is honoured to serve high-profile projects with the highest levels of technical knowledge and experience.
ENGEO New Zealand began in April 2010 as Geoscience Consulting (NZ) Ltd. a Geotechnical Engineering consultancy based in Christchurch with two founders. Following the Canterbury Earthquake Sequence, Geoscience was heavily involved in the assessment and rebuild efforts, and staff numbers began to grow rapidly. By the end of the first full year of operation we grew to 11 employees. Geoscience continued to grow rapidly through 2011, and we found it difficult to find good engineers to keep up with our increasing workload. However, during 2011 we met someone from ENGEO in the US and the cultures of our two companies aligned instantly.
“ENGEO was invited to come into New Zealand by a colleague we had worked with for a number of years. We entered New Zealand to assist with the whole post-earthquake recovery, and in the course of doing that we got familiar with Greg and the team from Geoscience. It was instant love and we ultimately joined forces literally within months.”
In early 2012 three engineers from California arrived in Christchurch to work in the Geoscience office. They got along so well that in April 2012 we decided to officially join forces. In September 2012 ENGEO acquired a stake in Geoscience, and helped to expand services to include an environmental team. The name changed to ENGEO Ltd in 2014.
Today, we have 98 staff located in offices throughout New Zealand and Australia, and we continue to grow. In addition to our core consulting business, we have also established Greater Good Holdings (GGH Ltd), an investment company, also based in Christchurch.
ENGEO continues to produce exceptional results for our clients, by staff who are passionate about engineering, science and technology.

meta title:The Dream Trust | ENGEO
meta description:N/A

In 2013 we initiated The Dream Trust, the charitable arm of ENGEO. 
It has raised around $250,000 since its inception and supports charitable organisations across New Zealand. It was established by the employees at ENGEO out of their desire to give back to the communities that have helped us grow. The Dream Trust is funded directly by the individual ENGEO employees, ENGEO itself, and anyone else who would like to support the organisation along the way. The Dream Trust isn’t just about raising funds, the staff at ENGEO love to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty while helping the community wherever we are needed.
“Being part of the ENGEO Dream Trust is incredibly rewarding and fulfilling. We set up the Dream Trust to give back to the communities in which we are fortunate enough to prosper, and seeing this in action is truly humbling. It is a privilege to work with amazing people making a difference locally, nationally and internationally.”
“Having such a great charitable arm of ENGEO makes me proud to be an employee. We are able to help such worthy causes and engage our whole company to support our local communities.”
Dropping off the rugby balls and stationary at the four schools around Manukau was really fun and highly gratifying, the kids were hard case and really appreciative
“Just wanted to extend our thanks and appreciation to you for visiting and helping out last weekend on The Old Ghost Road. Hopefully you had a good ride out and you’re not too tired starting the working week
Phil Rossiter- Chairman, Mokihinui-Lyell Backcountry Trust (Old Ghost Road)
I am writing in appreciation and gratitude for the generous donation from ENGEO Dream Trust towards our Christmas gifts. We distributed them in the days leading up to Christmas. AS a not for profit organisation we rely on support of our local community to help us support our families to thrive. Thanks to you, we can help to make this time of year special and memorable.

we’re a certified B Corporation ™
ENGEO is extremely proud to announce that we’ve become a Certified B Corporation™. We join a committed handful of Geotechnical companies in Australia who have taken this rewarding step.
What is the B Corp Certification?
 was established by B Lab, a non-profit organisation that serves people using business for good. The international certification recognises businesses meeting better standards of social and environmental performance and the certification process involved a rigorous assessment of our operations, covering five key impact areas: Governance, Workers, Community, Environment and Customers.
ENGEO is now one of more than 4,750 global businesses, across 78 countries, 155 industries including more than 400 in Australia, with the certification.
Certified B Corporations are leaders in the global movement for an inclusive, equitable opportunity, and regenerative economy. B Lab is unique in their ability to measure a company’s entire social and environmental impact.
To achieve B Corp Certification, each company is required to reach a benchmark score of over 80, while providing evidence of socially and environmentally responsible practices relating to energy supplies, waste and water use, worker compensation, diversity and corporate transparency.
ENGEO embraced the rigorous standards set out by B Corp and positively performed earning a B Impact score of 83.9.
You can read more about ENGEO’s full B Impact Report on the B Corporation website 
What does this mean for our clients and partners?
Fast becoming a global signpost for leadership in environmental and social impact, the ‘B’ logo is a way for clients and partners to instantly recognise that the businesses they work with are working according to a different and entirely new way of doing business.
Achieving B Corp Certification our clients can be proud to support a business that has the right balance of purpose with profit, as well as showing leadership in both social and environmental impact in all that we do.
Commenting on the certification, ENGEO AU / NZ CEO Guy Cassidy said,
We are ecstatic to announce ENGEO (Australia) Pty Ltd has certified as a B Corporation. We are always exploring better ways to do business and while the journey to certification isn’t an easy one, it’s absolutely worthwhile and we are committed to transform our business to be a force for good.”
