Planned system update: 11:59pm Friday 13 – 9am Sunday 15 October ACDT. 
We’re running a significant system update between 11:59pm Friday 13th and 9am Sunday 15th October (ACDT) which means that most of our banking services will be unavailable during this time.  
During this time, you will be unable to:
Access Internet Banking, the Mobile Banking App or Phone Banking services,
Send or receive money from other financial institutions,
Check your account balances (including via ATMs), or
You will still be able to make Visa, Credit Card, and mobile wallet payments, but the value of your transactions will be limited to your account balance as at 11:59pm Friday 13th October.
It’s important to plan ahead for the update period to minimise the risk of experiencing disruption.
For more information on how to prepare and how to contact us over the update period, visit
If you have any questions, call us on 13 11 82 or visit your local branch.
Due to changes in our cheque processing system, we have updated our chequebooks. This means that from 1 April 2023, you will not be able to use previously issued chequebooks that reference National Australia Bank and a BSB beginning with 085. These cheques will be declined from 1 April, regardless of when they have been written.
If you still have these cheques you will need to destroy them for security purposes. If you wish to keep using cheques and have not already received a replacement chequebook you will need to get in touch with us  
Chequebooks referencing Cuscal Limited and a BSB beginning with 805 (example below) are not affected.
Keeping your banking safe. People’s Choice will never contact you to request your passwords, VISA card/rediCard or account details.
We will not send you SMS containing links. Never share your password or Internet Banking login credentials.
If you have been contacted or are concerned about your privacy, contact People's Choice immediately by calling 
The security and fraud environment continues to evolve each and every day. People's Choice will always remain committed to being at the forefront of these changes to protect our members. There are a number of organisations also committed to increasing the understanding and knowledge of these issues to help consumers protect themselves and their families.
Suspension of VISA operations in the Russian Federation
As a result of the developing situation in Ukraine, VISA and Western Union have announced suspensions of their services in Russia.
This means that People’s Choice issued VISA cards will not operate when used in Russia or with businesses based within the Russian Federation.
This also means that VISA cards issued within Russia will not operate outside of the Russian Federation.
