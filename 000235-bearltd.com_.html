We're on a mission to create a better world.
We respectfully acknowledge the traditional custodians of this land and water, the Arakwal people of the Bundjalung Nation, and pay our respects to Elders past, present and emerging.
A place of ceremony and learning, the Cape Byron headland, known as Walgun, features in numerous Dreaming stories. It is the most eastern point of Australia, surrounded by the Arakwal National Park with uninterrupted views of the Pacific Ocean. The protected nature reserve is home to an endangered ecological community containing a large collective of native plants including the fern-leaved banksia, hairy bushpea, kangaroo grass, and broad sword sedge. A restoration project is currently in place to assist in preserving the native landscape.
Part of both the Cape Byron State Conservation area and the 22,000 hectare Cape Byron Marine Park, the region is one of the best places in the world to see humpback whales as they migrate north from Antartica up the East Australian coast to sub-tropical waters, from May to November. The traditional custodians, Arakwal Bumberlin of the Bundjalung people, continue to care for Cape Byron and work closely with the Cape Byron Marine Park.
As an Australian business based in the coastal town of Byron Bay in northern New South Wales, there is a great sense of community and strong connection to the land and ocean. We are actively learning and unlearning, exploring Australia’s rich biodiversity and seeking wisdom and agricultural knowledge to bring you the best of modern medicine, nutritional science and nature.
Our high performance wellness essentials are thoughtfully designed, formulated, and produced in Australia with great care and integrity. Our aim is to be evolutionary and considered as a brand — our products are of the highest safety and efficacy, formulated by our team of naturopaths, compounding chemists, medical professionals and microbiologists to support a holistic wellness journey. Always sustainably-sourced, gender neutral, and intentional in simplicity, design and function.
As a certified B Corporation, we meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability. B Corporation is a holistic, rigorous and independent certification awarded to businesses that have an explicit social or environmental mission. We are part of a community of leaders that drive a global movement; 2,700 companies in over 150 industries, spanning 64 countries with one unifying goal: to redefine success in business to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.
As a certified B Corporation, we have a legally binding fiduciary responsibility to take into account the interests of workers, the community and the environment. We actively educate our suppliers and partners on our environmental objectives and consistently develop new ways to minimise our ecological impact. We are committed to improving our business practices and neutralising resources we have used in our processes through initiatives such as recycling, planting trees, reducing our water, electricity, and waste, and fully offsetting our carbon emissions.
Sustainability is an integral part of our business and we are driven to be more conscious of our impact on the planet, innovate and create positive change for a brighter future. In 2019, BEAR was awarded among the top 10% of all Certified B Corporations globally for our commitment to community.
We donate a fixed dollar amount from each product sold to Australian conservation not-for-profits WildArk and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation to help protect the biodiversity of our planet.
We are proud to support WildArk, an Australian conservation not-for-profit committed to protecting and restoring the environment and the world’s ecosystems, natural resources, wildlife and wild places. WildArk’s true North is securing areas of identified green belts throughout the world and protecting these wild lands for which we all depend - from wildlife biodiversity to natural carbon storage - from the threat of industrialisation, deforestation, and poaching. WildArk embrace local partnerships and community engagement, working on the ground to establish a multitude of biodiversity projects including:
Rufunsa Rhino Conservancy — to protect 29,000 hectares and create a vital unfenced buffer zone to the north of the Lower Zambezi National Park in Zambia.
Grizzly Plains Conservancy — to secure a vital piece of land on the shore of the Kvichak River, one of the most important rivers in the greater Bristol Bay Salmon fishery in South West Alaska.
Tuke Rainforest Conservancy in partnership with the Tuke community to protect their rainforest from logging and to preserve their ancient way of life in Papua New Guinea.
Pridelands — to drop fences in Greater Kruger National Park and allow the free roaming of wildlife back into the property for the first time in decades in South Africa.
WildArk also support and empower initiatives aimed at ecosystem and species protection, working closely with conservation organisations to provide education, community support and relief, wildlife rescue and rehabilitation, ecological research, habitat restoration, climate change, food and water sustainability, and indigenous land protection.
Some of the organisations WildArk support include the NUII P.E.A.C.E Project in Namibia, to foster a peaceful co-existence between critically endangered desert-adapted elephants and the communities that live alongside them, WIRES in New South Wales, who actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife, The Earth Alliance Amazon Forest Fund in the Amazon Forest, who provide critical resources on the key protections needed to maintain the ‘lungs of the planet’, Local Ocean Conservation in Kenya to help protect nesting sea turtles and establish critical education and community outreach programs, and the Southern African Wildlife College in South Africa who specialise in conservation education, training and skills development as well as wildlife management to equip their students with the appropriate skills to help combat the poaching crisis.
We are proud to support the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, the lead charity dedicated to protecting the Great Barrier Reef and marine life for future generations. The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living structure on earth, spanning 2,300 kilometres across Australia’s Queensland coastline. Global warming, acidifying water, pollution, mining activity and overfishing are all immediate threats to the worlds reefs.
The Great Barrier Reef Foundation is driving real solutions to the threats facing Australia’s greatest natural wonder, bringing together people and science to deliver the world largest coral reefs program with over 60 Reef-saving projects. The funds they raise are directed at projects with large-scale impact – helping protect the coral reefs and the animals that depend on them. Working closely with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority they help to regenerate and restore the Great Barrier Reef, focusing on projects that improve Reef health grounded in science, technology, engineering, and on-ground action.
Through our Indigenous Art Club programme, we are proud to donate 100% of profits from the sale of our HOLIDAY 21 DUET to help support Aboriginal artists in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Caring for culture and Indigenous traditional knowledge is essential to keep contemporary Aboriginal art strong.
Aboriginal Art Centres provide economic, cultural and social benefits for some of Australia’s most disadvantaged communities. The Indigenous Art Club programme supports and empowers initiatives that provide opportunities for strong community engagement, training, advocacy, business management, and resourcing to strengthen Aboriginal art and culture.
We cannot have a green and peaceful future without equality, civil rights, and empowered communities. Black lives matter. Indigenous lives matter. Indigenous communities have a profound spiritual connection to the earth. Land is their mother, and is central to their culture. Climate change adaptation needs to be tailored to local contexts and provide opportunities for strong indigenous community engagement. Many are dependent on local biodiversity and ecosystem services for their sustenance and well-being, and are more vulnerable than most to the impacts of climate change.
Indigenous peoples possess a wealth of environmental knowledge - we must acknowledge Indigenous culture and integrate traditional and regenerative practices to protect land and water, as they have for Millenia. We must live in harmony with nature, and one another. Our children’s future depends on it.
We are committed to working towards a more sustainable future and are proud to be fully offsetting our carbon emissions each calendar year by supporting the Yarra Yarra Biodiversity Corridor, the first Australian project certified by the Gold Standard to help minimise our impact on the environment. We have calculated, accounted for and offset our CO₂-e through Carbon Neutral so that our net emissions equal zero.
The Gold Standard is widely considered to be the highest standard in the world for carbon offsets. They are a non-profit foundation under Swiss Law and funded by public and private donors. They have committed themselves to implementing the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement in the spirit of true and long-term emission reductions and sustainable development.
The Yarra Yarra Biodiversity Corridor is a native reforestation project that aims to re-establish the natural landscape of a 200km corridor in the northern wheatbelt of Southwest Australia. It removes 1.897 million tonnes of carbon in a region where over 90% of the woodland has been cleared. The project aims to revegetate the landscape of the Corridor and return the environment to its original state, after decades of habitat loss and degradation, while simultaneously removing carbon from the atmosphere.
This is done by planting up to 60 different tree and shrub species indigenous to the region to help sequester carbon dioxide, conserve soil and water, prevent salinity and protect and stabilise ground cover.. The goal is to create a green corridor that will reconnect coastal regions with drier inland habitats. The Corridor will provide birds and animals with habitat for food, nests and protection from predators, encouraging them to transition through the landscape.
Since the launch of the Yarra Yarra Biodiversity Corridor project in 2008, 30 million trees and shrubs have been planted restoring over 13,000 hectares of land. Trees are the world’s single largest source of breathable oxygen and play a vital role in maintaining safe levels of carbon dioxide and addressing climate change.
Our studio is part of the voluntary GreenPower program to help reduce our impact on the environment. We commit our GreenPower providers to purchasing the equivalent amount of electricity from accredited renewable energy generators, which generate electricity from sources like wind, solar, water and bioenergy. Working closely with a team of experts to measure, reduce and offset greenhouse gas emissions, we have made a commitment as a business to be carbon positive in 2021.
All of our products are 100% vegan and contain no animal products or animal by-products of any kind. We do not test our products on animals, nor ask third parties to do so on our behalf.
Our Essential Daily Vitamins are hard tablets with a natural plant-based coating, free from palm oil and gelatin. Palm oil is widely used in the supplement industry as a tablet coating. Unsustainable palm oil production is responsible for deforestation - a leading contributor to climate change and air, soil and water pollution. Illegal palm oil plantations threaten the habitats of endangered species including orangutans, elephants and tigers.
Gelatin is derived from collagen, a protein found in bone, cartilage and connective tissue. Collagen in beauty and food supplements comes from the waste by-products (bone and skin) of factory farmed livestock, or in the case of marine collagen, from the scales of deep-sea fish that may contain harmful levels of mercury. Once digested, collagen is broken down into the constituent amino acids, not repackaged as new collagen in the skin. Once consumed, collagen will never reach the skin intact. Gelatin is a key ingredient in gummy vitamins and is used as a coating ingredient or filler in gel capsule supplements.
Whey, the most common ingredient in protein powders, is a waste byproduct of dairy production. To mask its sour taste, whey is often combined with artificial flavours (chocolate, vanilla) and sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin). Whey is high in lactose, a common allergen, contains no essential fatty acids, and is low in vitamins and minerals. Vegan alternatives, such as pea and rice, are often combined to replicate a complete amino acid profile. They contain very little fibre and are often high in sodium. Many plant-based alternatives also contain sweeteners and additives including taurine, a stimulant used in energy drinks and guar gum, a thickening agent found in processed foods. Our single-origin Essential Daily Superpowders are all-natural and contains no additives, artificial sweeteners, stimulants or thickening agents.
Our Repair Essential Daily Superpowder contains hemp protein from cold-pressed Australian hemp seeds cultivated in Tasmania and is the only plant protein source to contain all 20 essential amino acids for optimal bioavailability and digestion. The super seeds are rich in activated protein, far greater than chia or flax, and contain omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids, antioxidants vitamin E, C and A, and minerals potassium, magnesium, calcium and zinc for healthy skin, muscle repair, normal bone health, and naturally radiant skin. Repair is rich in essential fatty acids which are active in encouraging new collagen production, microcirculation and improving skin elasticity.
Our all-natural skincare is ethically produced and contains no beeswax. Beeswax, widely used in cosmetics and skincare, is derived from precious honeycomb that honeybee colonies rely on to survive. Honeybees are essential to crop pollination, and without them, one third of the crops we consume may cease to exist.
We carefully source ingredients from around the world and take pride in researching and producing our wellness essentials in Australia with great care and integrity. We use biodynamic and certified organic ingredients of the highest quality and therapeutic nature, to deliver optimal bioavailability to ensure nutrients are readily absorbed by the body.
Our products are of the highest safety and proven efficacy, formulated by our team of naturopaths, compounding chemists, medical professionals and microbiologists to support a holistic wellness journey.
We understand the importance of building relationships with the suppliers, producers and farmers we work with, both locally and around the world. Our health is directly linked to the state of our natural environment - the air we breathe, the water we drink, the soil that grows our food. We actively educate our partners on our environmental objectives and consistently develop new ways to minimise our ecological impact and live in harmony with our environment.
We are committed to ensuring each product is free from toxic and hazardous ingredients including genetically modified ingredients (GMO), sulphates, parabens, synthetic fragrances and colours, glycols, silicones, PEGs and phthalates. All of our products are free from palm oil, gluten, flavour additives, artificial sweeteners, stimulants and thickening agents.
Harnessing the powers of plants for medicine is our oldest known system for healing. We encourage you to browse our Ingredient Directory to discover the high-performing ingredients we use in our products.
Our Essential Daily Vitamins are certified as a listed medicine by Australia’s regulatory authority, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). The TGA safeguards the health of the Australian and International community through effective and timely regulation of therapeutic goods. Their compliance functions support the broader regulatory objectives, including consumer protection, and enable a fair market for industry. They monitor, and enforce where necessary, compliance with the legislation, regulations and rules for therapeutic goods; import, manufacturing, advertising, supply, and export.
The TGA also works to ensure that Australian and international manufacturers operate in a way that results in their products meeting required standards. The TGA conducts regular inspections of manufacturers, both in Australia and overseas, to ensure they continue to meet these standards. As science and research evolves, we continue to develop our methods and processes to ensure our products meet the highest standards of compliance across the global health and beauty industry, to help serve public safety and wellbeing.
All of our products are housed in 100% recycled medical-grade amber glass jars and bottles to protect against UV light and eliminate the need for preservatives. Glass is non-toxic and infinitely recyclable.
Chemicals used in thousands of everyday plastics leach toxins and pollutants into our bodies endocrine system, known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). This leaching process occurs over time and there is no regulatory testing process on these products once they have left the manufacturing facility. Phthalates are chemical binding agents used to make soft plastic commonly used for toothpaste, shampoo, and cosmetic packaging.
Researchers have linked Phthalates to asthma, breast cancer, obesity and type II diabetes, reproductive health and fertility issues. BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical added to plastics for flexibility and strength. It imitates female sex hormones and has been linked to breast and prostate cancers, liver enzyme abnormalities and cardiovascular issues. While BPA is a banned cosmetic ingredient, it is still widely used in many familiar items including plastic food containers and water bottles.
We use a natural uncoated Forest Stewardship Council (FSC 100%) paper stock across all our labels and product boxes, where the wood within the product comes entirely from FSC-certified, well-managed forests. We fully offset all carbon emissions for the transport of each order and ship products in natural recycled cardboard boxes and compostable courier satchels made from plant material, that are biodegradable in six months.

Wellness is our greatest luxury — curious mind, strong body, open heart, conscious living
We have always been drawn to clean, thoughtful design and quality products, and we were inspired to create a modern Australian lifestyle brand with integrity and sustainability at the forefront. Wellness is our greatest luxury.
As an Australian brand based in the coastal town of Byron Bay, the ocean is our home. We are a Certified B Corporation and we are driven to be more conscious of our impact on the planet and create positive change for a more sustainable future. We work closely with Australian conservation movements WildArk and the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, donating at least 2% of revenue from each product sold to help protect and conserve the wonders of the natural world and the wildlife that inhabit them.
The beauty and wellness landscape is rapidly changing, and people are more conscious than ever before to invest in brands that are socially responsible, ethical, and sustainable, with products that are clean and non-toxic, not tested on animals and of the highest quality and proven efficacy. As a certified B-Corporation, we are proud to be at the forefront of this movement. We look forward to continuing this journey together, bringing you the best of modern medicine, nutritional science, and nature.

We are very excited to share that as of early 2022, you will only be able to purchase BEAR through our website, our experiential pop-ups and our future flagship concepts. We are exiting all wholesale channels to become a 100% direct-to-community brand as we look to set and deliver a new benchmark in the wellness, beauty and lifestyle categories. 
This change represents a significant shift for the brand but is underscored by our deep and future-focused commitments to authentic sustainability, regeneration and transparency. Despite reaching wholesale stockists in over 200 stores across Australia, USA, EU and UK recently, we found this channel and intermediaries such as sales agents to be incredibly wasteful on resources across packaging, digital carbon, freight along with scope one, two and three emissions.
We have calculated that we will save and reduce emissions alone by up to 35% almost immediately by removing wholesale channels and third-party stockists from our operating model. Our purpose is to use the wellness and beauty industry to create a better world, and this is another example of our meaningful commitment to delivering on this long-term vision. Thank you for your ongoing support.
