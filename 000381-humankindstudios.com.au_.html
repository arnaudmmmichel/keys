Salty Sips was started by Adelaide locals Lily Biggs and Nikita Trewartha in 2021. 
It began with 4 friends who bonded over a mutual love a morning ocean dip and quickly grew to over 400 humans. Human.Kind physiotherapist and facilitator Ciara Foley and teacher training graduate Jamie Bucirde stepped up to provide the pre-swim yoga flow for the growing tribe.
In 2022 Human.Kind came on to support the event. We love creating healthy communities. So we provided the yoga and some money (because even free events cost $ to put on!) Then in April 2023 we took over the reigns from Lil & Nikita as they pursue other adventures.
After a short hiatus over the winter months to regroup, we're back building upon this epic community offering. Hundreds of healthy humans gather at the beach every Wednesday at dawn. It's something seriously special. Join us. All welcome.
