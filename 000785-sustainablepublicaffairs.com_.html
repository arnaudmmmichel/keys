meta description:A case study. Chromium trioxide is a ‘Substance of Very High Concern’ that can cause cancer. However, the EU wanted to authorise its use.

Case Study - SustainablePublicAffairs shows how it works
Chromium trioxide is a ‘Substance of Very High Concern’ that can cause cancer. However, the EU wanted to authorise its use for another 12 years. 
Innovative entrepreneurs developed a sustainable alternative but could not wait for 12 more years to get it to market. 
We helped these alternative providers to accelerate market access using the highly-complex REACH authorisation process as 
As a solution, we built an alliance of alternative providers, uniting competitors and assisting them in engaging with the key policy-makers in the REACH process.
 Strategic communications: Our credibility as an interlocutor, as well as our alliances with NGOs, allowed us to ensure the message was heard throughout the regulatory process. The alliance was raised to the level of the relevant Commissioner, putting the issue of sustainable chemical substitution at the top of the EU legislative agenda.
As a result of a society-wide campaign, the use of this chemical was only granted authorisation for another 7 years instead of 12 years that the Commission initially proposed – because we made clear that alternatives existed. 
This spurred the demand for alternative solutions, showing that sustainable business cases do work: the alternative providers can enter the EU market 5 years earlier!
We lobby for climate positive impacts and we also operate climate positively.

We center our service around cases rather than companies

Want to get a latest snapshot of who we work with? Check out our up to date registry in the 
, and want to know what they think of us? Check out our 
 or feel free to read some of them below.
Clémence Arto – Head of European Government Affairs
“When I started looking for a consultancy firm to help us navigate the EU institutional and policy landscape, #SustainablePublicAffairs matched all my criteria: a human-size firm with a deep knowledge of the Brussels spheres and a true commitment for sustainability. 
I had a lot of expectations and they have delivered above and beyond since day 1. With them by our side, I am confident that we can make a difference in the EU policies for the green and digital transition of the Built Environment.”
Asbjørn Haugstrup – Chief Communication & Public Affairs Officer
Since the beginning of 2023, we have been working together with #SustainablePublicAffairs on advocating for geothermal district heating and building a network and raise awareness among key Brussels stakeholders. We are on the mission to decarbonize heat by bringing geothermal heating as a service to millions of homes with district heating companies. It is a pleasure working with the team from #SustainablePublicAffairs – they are very knowledgeable and proactive delivering high-quality work and counselling. I would not hesitate to recommend #SustainablePublicAffairs to other cleantech frontrunners.
Sanne Verhoeven – Senior Corporate Communications Manager
“Public affairs doesn’t always have a good ring to it, so when we wanted to hire a public affairs agency, we wanted to be sure it had the same vision on sustainability. That is why we engaged #SustainablePublicAffairs, and it turns out that was the right choice! It’s great to see how their expertise and knowledge dovetails into ours, providing us the opportunity to propel the transition towards a more sustainable future together.”
Bo Krogvig – Vice-President of Strategic Projects
“At LKAB we lead the way to fossil-free iron & steel making. We have invested massively in sustainability, like for example in our HYBRIT process. In order to thrive we need EU policy frameworks to make our performance on sustainability the norm for the rest of the industry and we need to convince the Commission not to favor the status-quo. That means we have a lot of convincing advocacy work to do. One of our partners is therefore #SustainablePublicAffairs, as they have the right combination of knowledge on content, creativity and credibility to help us to transform our sustainability leadership into a competitive advantage. We believe that working with them also says something about us and our commitment to competitive sustainability!”
Mélanie Lambelet – Director Communications and Government Affairs
“As the world’s largest recycler of aluminium, at Novelis we are used to pushing forward sustainable innovations and circular solutions for our sector. Therefore, we have been delighted to find a like-minded partner in #SustainablePublicAffairs.
Like us, they are not content to work in the ways of the past and they share our ambition to shape our respective sector towards a more sustainable future. Our collaboration thus far has been an energizing and successful experience, whether through insightful policy analysis or by exploring new lines of communication with peers and policy-makers alike. It’s an inspiring thought that one day all public affairs will look like this!”
“At Niaga® we redesign products for circularity, so materials won’t end up as waste. Ever. Together with partners, everyday products are designed with clean and infinite materials and reversible connections only. The Niaga® tag supports partners in the transparency of the materials used in their products, and enables the return, refurbishment and reuse of components and products again and again.
However, for reuse, repair, refurbishment and high level recycling to work ingredient transparency and standardized qualifications are crucial and still a missing link. For the circular economy to work they hopefully become the market norm. For that we need ambitious EU regulation.
To help us share this important learning on national and EU level we were looking for a PA agency that shares our sustainability drive and purpose and at the same time knows the policy landscape and relevant stakeholders. I must say that we are more than satisfied about our cooperation with #SustainablePublicAffairs. The whole team is very professional and pleasant to work with and has been excellent in understanding and representing our business, pointing us to the right information and opportunities and in connecting us to the right people. #SustainablePublicAffairs lives up to their reputation in every way.”
The Climate Finance Fund helps to mobilize capital for climate solutions across China, the European Union, and the United States. We decided to cooperate with #SustainablePublicAffairs to get foothold in the European Union as they know the European arena while at the same time sharing our commitment to drive change through supporting innovative finance and the systemic decarbonization of capital. #SustainablePublicAffairs has successfully assisted us with establishing an EU stakeholder network, as well as raising the profile of our work in Brussels. We look forward to continuing our cooperation on the Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion lens in climate finance, thereby creating a positive impact for people and planet.
Jasper Munier – Business Development Manager
As a global cleantech company, introducing a proprietary recycling technology that end the life of plastic transforming it into high quality green petrochemicals, Clariter is an unconventional player in the recycling and petrochemical sectors. That is why we attracted #SustainablePublicAffairs, they bring us the right team to be our ambassadors to EU policymaking. #SustainablePublicAffairs provide us their insight and expertise and help us act proactively. They navigate the corridors of Brussels on our behalf, helping us to stay in step with EU policies, and helping EU policies stay in step with us.
Isabelle Pinzauti Babrzyński – Senior Advocacy and Outreach Manager
As IBMA, the International Biocontrol Manufacturers’ Association, we are delighted to work with the consultants of #SustainablePublicAffairs. They combine extended advocacy and European institutions knowledge, shared values and know-how in supporting an association like ours, both from a professional and human point of view.
Brenda Bates – Head of Brand and Corporate Communications
We have only been working with #SustainablePublicAffairs for a short time and already we are seeing the benefits of our partnership. The team is expert, enthusiastic and very well networked in Brussels. They are proving effective at supporting our effort to build relationships and raise awareness of the availability of low carbon cement, and the contribution it can make to accelerating CO2 reduction in an industry traditionally seen as hard to abate. Importantly their focus on working with frontrunners for sustainability means that our missions and goals are aligned.
Perran Harvey – Senior Global Policy Lead
Upfield champions a transition to sustainable food systems, with a shift to more plant-based diets and foods. Our partnership with #SustainablePublicAffairs has been productive and useful. Their focus on sustainability policy means they have deep knowledge of relevant issues, and they are passionate about their work. This passion shows. Their hard work and expert advice have proved invaluable.
“It is not an easy task finding a public affairs agency that supports frontrunners for sustainability as its core business. 
#SustainablePublicAffairs has taken up the challenge and through their expertise and knowledge of both processes and people in the EU public affairs world, they are striving and succeeding in fulfilling their mission. They also showed great flexibility in adapting to our needs and building the expertise of their team to provide the best support to us. 
Working with the team of #SustainablePublicAffairs was definitely a success story for us, and we are grateful for the continuous and hard work they have put in helping us achieve our goals.”
From the first meeting, we knew we had found a partner who understood what we are trying to achieve within Carbon Removals. #SustainablePublicAffairs not only brings an insightful understanding of the EU public affairs but backs it up with a strong team of passionate professionals who have helped us since day 1. Our collaboration has been a leading factor in the initial set up of our policy platform in Brussels.
Niels Schreuder – Public Affairs & Communication
“Knowing the EU public affairs scene quite well, I was surprised by the audacity of Willem Vriesendorp to start a new and independent public affairs consultancy, breaking away from the traditional ones. Instead of accepting any work possible, they carefully judge which causes they will work on. Personally, I appreciate #SustainablePublicAffairs for the ability they’ve shown to bring us in touch with peers and like-minded clients, among which are pioneers and trendsetters in the field of renewable and sustainable energy solutions. It is amazing that just months after starting, they are so influential and successful already, and … this is just the beginning!”
“At Cleantech for Europe, our mission is to help the EU lead the race to net zero, by scaling up our clean technologies. #SustainablePublicAffairs is not a consultancy, they are part of our team. 
They are helping us build relationships with top decision-makers in Brussels and advocate for ambitious climate innovation policy. Besides being very good at what they do, our mission alignment on decarbonisation means they’re thinking the same way we are.”
Establishing a new market for green ammonia is no easy feat. #SustainablePublicAffairs has been integral to our efforts by outlining policies with the EU Commission and various renewable organizations which will help support and build clean energy facilities like ours. Their knowledge, expertise and involvement with driving policies that support the energy transition have been essential, as we position ourselves as a global leader in the green hydrogen to ammonia industry. We are pleased to consider #SustainablePublicAffairs an extension of our European team.
“We decided to cooperate with #SustainblePublicAffairs because we needed not only a reliable partner supplying us with updated intelligence and information, but someone that shares our values and vision. We do not only need to understand main policy trends, but want to rely on a partner that can anticipate our needs and request. This is only possible when we both know where the sustainability journey will and should bring us!”
We have found a young, but well prepared, passionate team that fights for the right causes. A very positive experience.
André van Wageningen – Director Public Affairs EU/NL
“The time to have an impact as public affairs community is now – with the European Green Deal at full speed. In all honesty, for us this also meant we needed support to drive change. While looking for an agency that shares our vision, ambition as well as commitment to sustainability we decided to partner with #SustainablePublicAffairs. It turns out that was the right choice! We can bounce of ideas like we have been working together for years, build on each other’s competences and expertise and create the intimacy needed to make it all work, and propel the transition to a more sustainable future together.”
Lucia Hortelano – EU Policy Manager
At ProVeg International we work to transform the global food system by promoting more plant-based diets. For that reason, it was very important for us to find a consultancy that prioritizes sustainability as its core business. Their consultants are highly skilled professionals who have a wealth of experience in their respective fields. They were able to provide us with valuable strategic insights and advice, helping to elevate our profile whilst making informed decisions. The whole AGRI/FOOD team has demonstrated a remarkable level of knowledge and adaptability in meeting our NGO needs, would absolutely recommend cooperation and work with #SustainablePublicAffairs.
From the very beginning, #SustainablePublicAffairs came up with numerous imaginative ideas and approaches, and we quickly got to a very clear strategy for photovoltaics, that makes business sense. I particularly admire their approach to accepting new clients, refusing any company, however large or well known, that is not entirely focused on a more sustainable future. They are the first to do PA this way and they are leading the sustainability revolution in their own sector: public affairs. Hopefully very soon #SustainablePublicAffairs will simply become the norm for all lobbying!
Joost de Kluijver – Founder and Director
“In our view, #SustainablePublicAffairs’ has created the new standard for the PA industry. Not only because of their green mindset. We mostly appreciate their hands-on and pragmatic 
approach towards creating positive impact in Brussels.’’
We are very happy that #SustainablePublicAffairs has helped us to coordinate positions on climate policy among our membership. Eurelectric strives to achieve a carbon-neutral electricity mix in Europe well before mid-century and it was a logical choice to be working with #SustainablePublicAffairs on this.
Apart from strong expertise on the content of the relevant policies, their team had proven track record in association affairs, which for us was a critical requirement. Based on our cooperation, I would not hesitate to recommend #
We lobby for climate positive impacts and we also operate climate positively.

What lobbyists choose to promote has consequences for society.
We lead the sustainability revolution where it is most needed, and at the same time almost utterly absent: public affairs. We set a new standard for our industry. That is why we chose the rather odd name 
#SustainablePublicAffairs exclusively lobbies for cases that have a positive impact on the environment. We work for sustainable frontrunners and want to make their performance the norm for the rest. We believe in market-led sustainability and advocate for regulatory conditions that optimise that.
It is difficult to define – and people much smarter than ourselves have not even fully figured it out, so we do not claim to know the answer. We do know, though, what “sustainable public affairs” is.
Sustainable public affairs is the practice of lobbying for more ambitious environmental policies or better enforcement of current regulations in order to make the performance of sustainable frontrunners the norm.
It is our mission to foster policy-driven growth for those sustainable frontrunners.
That also means we cannot simply work for anyone. 
We discuss every new case on its merits, with our colleagues, strategic advisors, our other clients – and with our loved ones and children. They form our ethical compass, our true “sustainability board”. 
To help us in this process, we have developed our own due diligence framework to determine whether a case is a #SustainablePublicAffairs case, which we discuss with all colleagues. Everyone has a veto. The due diligence framework consists of around 40 considerations, but the four main questions are:
Would we operate in a sector where we can have a significant positive impact on the environment? 
Though sustainability innovations are welcome everywhere, we exclude some sectors from the outset, including fossil fuels, tobacco, pesticides, arms and Furthermore, we leave to others the promotion of company interests related to government regimes we do not support.
If a prospective client operates in a sector where we can make a significant positive impact, we need to be sure they are the “sustainable frontrunner” doing the most to facilitate the green transition in that sector. 
Does the prospective client outperform existing EU sustainability regulations and norms? Are they (far) beyond their competitors in this sense? 
We are the brand for radical, disruptive, breakthrough solutions, for challengers in the market, and want to make their performance the norm. We therefore leave the advocacy for incumbents that prefer to do incremental sustainability innovation, to others.
If we are convinced the prospective client is a sustainable frontrunner, we then ask ourselves: 
are they willing to let us perform only positive advocacy to raise the bar on EU legislation up to their standards?
 Although we value checks and balances in a democracy, and it sometimes is important to lobby against things, this is not what #SustainablePublicAffairs is about. Our brand stands for lobbying only in favor of higher ambition. We avoid working for exemptions, watering down targets, delaying policies, etc.
Finally, we need to positively answer one last question: 
are the potential clients themselves positive, constructive, and kind people? 
We believe that successful public affairs is a deeply creative and intellectual collaboration and that this is best achieved in a safe space, containing mutual admiration and respect.
If we have positive answers to these questions, we know that what we are doing is #SustainablePublicAffairs and we will go all in. If not, we do not take the case. And we are serious about that. We have put this rule into practice many, many times – and only move ahead with, on average, one out of every three prospects. 
When we get to work, we are guided by three values, without which sustainability can never exist: 
. We work with positive energy, and always in favour of the cases we advocate for. We try never to emit negative energy and will never act against others, nor do we speak badly about competitors. We are inclusive and when we address anyone, we think “brother” or “sister” before we write or speak their names.
 is standing up for what you believe in. As professionals, we only work for societal outcomes that we would want to see as private citizens as well. It means also that we recognize that while many sustainability gains will come from the cases we advocate for, we believe it is always more sustainable to consume, and subsequently produce, less.
 means being unafraid and open about our beliefs and advocating for them – also as an agency. For example, we provided 
our own input to the EU 2040 targets
, and we will always act in accordance with those objectives.
I hope it is now clearer for you what #SustainablePublicAffairs is and why it is unique. At the same time, I do sincerely hope that the need for #SustainablePublicAffairs will soon become obsolete, as all regulators will have automatically tied their policies to the best and most sustainable actors in class. 
Until that day, let’s keep up the good work.
We lobby for climate positive impacts and we also operate climate positively.
