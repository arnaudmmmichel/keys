The top 5 things to consider when deciding on the right business planning and analytics software
How will this tool help your business? At a fundamental level, good FP&A software should allow your team to set and track goals, create dashboards and generate  reports. But how does the software assist your team in streamlining work, or arriving at important insights quicker?
The overhead required to onboard new software should not be taken lightly. Particularly with software which needs to be used at the heart of decision making across the business. Key to the most successful implementations of FP&A software is the ability for a variety of users across the business to adopt and support their own reporting and analysis needs.
Good support from the vendor can make a big difference in terms of getting the most out of your analytics platform and ensuring that any issues are quickly resolved. Also think about the different ways in which your team might like to learn. Is there documentation? Video tutorials? Are they easy to contact for help?
Not least important is price. The cost of integrated BI software should consider the time, and implementation as well as ongoing subscription costs. The costs should be weighed against the productivity gains as with any software consideration.
The platform should be able to integrate with a wide variety of other software and data sources. Otherwise, you’ll still end up with data stuck in silos. It’s also essential that your integration plan is well laid out to ensure you retain data integrity. You will want to find a vendor who not only has great software, but a great team with proven experience in successful implementations.
Lastly, you always want to do a bit of detective work to see what others say about a platform. So find as many points of reference until you feel comfortable taking that next step.

At Phocas, we are committed to providing a robust and reliable software application, supported by first class data security and privacy for our customers.
Conscientious about security, vigilant about monitoring and quick to react
It is critical that our customers have confidence in the security of our application.
To provide a secure end-to-end solution, we continually upgrade our systems by investing in the latest technologies. We work closely with our respected 
, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Armor security to follow industry best practice.
While we have enlisted some of the best technology partners in the world to create a secure environment, the responsibility for data security ultimately lies with us;
Our multi-disciplinary internal team regularly reviews our applications, platforms, procedures, and processes to ensure any security, compliance and privacy issues are addressed, communicated, and resolved as appropriate.
We continually meet industry best practice with Security and Privacy compliance for SOC2 and GDPR. 
Our dedicated global team works to ensure customer data is secure all day, every day.
We are audited for SOC2 (System and Organization Controls 2) compliance annually for Security and Availability. Our current SOC2 Type II report is from calendar year 2022.
This independent examination is an extension of the Type 1 report completed in 2021.
Established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the examination validates Phocas’ security practices and controls and ensures that Phocas meets the Trust Services principles and criteria for security and availability over an extended period of time.

To achieve B Corp certification, a company must meet the following criteria: 
 by achieving an assessment score of 80 or above and passing a risk review.  
where the corporate governance structure is accountable to all stakeholders. 
 by allowing B Corp performance to be publicly available. 
Phocas earned an impressive overall score of 82.4 in the B Impact Assessment, well above the median score of 50.9.

Customer data is our responsibility, and we’re committed to protecting it from unauthorized access and supporting our customers in meeting their data privacy obligations. We provide information and governance controls to help you make the right decisions for your organization. Additionally, we’ve invested heavily in GDPR, Privacy Shield, and stringent privacy safeguards to keep your data private and under your control. 
We publish and regularly update our Privacy Policy which outlines how we collect, use and process data for our own use, and for use by our customers in the Phocas platform.  
Additionally, we comply with data privacy laws and regulations in the United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand and the United States to ensure customer data is safe and protected.

Through partners, we continually measure current processes, procedures and the security stance against best practice based on our partners’ recommendations. For infrastructure best practice and remediation activities, we work with our partners AWS and Armor to provide and maintain a compliance baseline. Additionally, we maintain several compliance and monitoring tools that assist in identifying gaps, ensuring we continually maintain compliance.
We also leverage against our partners’ compliance achievements, such as ISO 27001 and SOC2, amongst others. For more information on our partner compliance certifications see:

To provide customers with the greatest degree of reliability, performance and security, we host data in several global locations, including the USA, Canada, UK, EU and Australia.  We are always looking for the next steps in hosting infrastructure, to constantly improve our offering to customers. We maintain an ongoing focus on security, performance and compliance. To achieve this, internal platform specialists actively work with our cloud hosting partners AWS and tools to continually investigate and deploy the latest technology.  
Rigorous planning and processes have been put in place to enable continuous maintenance and monitoring of our services and infrastructure.
All our servers and infrastructure components are managed through a centralised configuration management system. All changes adhere to our standard change management process and are tracked and stored via source control. 
Upgrades to firmware and OS (patching)
All our servers and infrastructure components are upgraded according to the manufacturer and partner (support and security) recommendations. All upgrades are scheduled, automated and monitored. 
Our product software upgrades are performed according to published release schedules. Upgrades are performed out of business hours and typically take around 5 minutes. Currently, most releases are performed monthly. We are continuing to work towards a goal of no-downtime upgrades, to further reduce the user impact. 
Under our robust backup plan, essential data stored on the Phocas Cloud (our private network) is automatically backed up daily and stored offsite. Processes are automated via AWS tools and monitored by AWS and our internal teams.
Off-site backups are kept in accordance with recovery and retention plans.
Customer data is backed up daily and stored for up to 14 months in secure off-site, online storage.
We use the latest autoscaling tools provided by our partners. We automatically monitor the availability, performance and capacity of our end-to-end platform. We meet regularly to proactively identify and rectify potential issues.
We constantly monitor the entire Phocas Cloud internally and with our cloud partner AWS. This includes performance and security monitoring using centralized log management and security tools. 
We have a target of 99.9% infrastructure availability and achieve 99.99% (average of Production infrastructure H1 2023). We maintain a web page that reports on infrastructure availability and service interruptions. All our Phocas customers are hosted on AWS infrastructure that is built with availability, security and redundancy at the fore.
Learn more at the Amazon data center page
Our platform is monitored and supported all day, every day. Our technical teams in our global regions work to a “follow the sun” support model. Our support capability is further enhanced by the AWS enterprise technical support teams.
We are committed to providing security for all customers, always.
Our infrastructure has been designed with security built in at every stage. Infrastructure designs are reviewed according to the security standards set by AWS, via their best practice ‘Well Architected Review’ process.
Additionally, we partner with Armor who provides constant monitoring of all our server infrastructure. They identify any irregularities on our servers, down to the file level, via their Security Operations Centre (SOC).
Our security is built on the principle of 
 and this is demonstrated by the following principles and actions;
By default, any user on our network is assumed to be hostile
Every device, user and network flow is authenticated and authorized
A wide variety of preventative techniques that cover identity, endpoint, data, and application access are in place
Real time monitoring and controls prevent malicious activity
All servers and infrastructure components are updated regularly to ensure we always follow vendor security recommendations.
Our network with AWS is separated into different availability and security zones, all behind AWS firewalls, gateways and other perimeter protection services.
Segmentation and separation of data and environments
We host customer data in geographically diverse regions to ensure maximum performance and maintain data sovereignty. Each region is hosted on distinct AWS accounts and networks, then further segregated into production, internal, development and testing environments.
We annually assess vulnerabilities in our internal and external facing environments with third-party penetration security specialists. All recommendations are prioritized and addressed by our internal multi-disciplinary security team.
Additionally, through AWS and Armor, we have daily, year-round monitoring and alerting of any irregularities on the perimeters and inside of our hosted environments. Armor provides us with real-time threat response, intrusion detection and prevention, malware protection, file integrity monitoring and vulnerability scanning.
All data transferred to and stored within the Phocas Cloud uses industry-recognized encryption methods. 
We support AES256, TLS1.3 at a minimum and continually revise these standards as options become available.
At-rest data inside the Phocas Cloud is encrypted by default. This includes all data on servers, including files, databases and backups.
Data is encrypted in-flight using HTTPS or SFTP.
The Phocas application suite is a variety of multi-tiered-architecture applications, consisting of the following layers:
Firewalls (network and application) and load balancers support and secure this design.
All our development change processes have quality and security components built in, covering:
Additionally, our development teams ensure ongoing quality is being met, with static code analysis, test coverage and quality metrics. The automated test suite includes UI, unit, functional, integration, e2e, m2e, and regression testing across all stack layers in the application. Manual smoke testing is conducted against all new features. All software development and testing environments are separated from customer production environments for quality assurance. 
We employ strict processes around all aspects of application development and deployment.
Agile work practices allow us to rapidly address and resolve any identified issues or bugs.
All application design work is planned and managed via cloud-based collaborative design interfaces and tracked via an integrated ticketing system. 
All developer work (features, bug fixes, improvements) is planned, managed, and tracked via an integrated ticketing system. All committed code is stored in a source-control repository. Development is performed via a unique branch for each issue, prior to peer review and manual and automated testing. The branch is then merged with other changes for further testing before the deployment process.
Packaged software is automatically created, published and sent via a deployment pipeline, allowing for a reusable and formalized deployment process that updates the development, preproduction and production environments.
Real time application monitoring is configured against development and production environments. 
The application is designed and developed with built-in security to prevent Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) risks including SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Control Functional Level Access.
A dedicated security group actively monitors, assesses and addresses security risks. New risks are identified internally via automated tools and manual testing, and externally via third party auditing and penetration testing.
Within the application itself, there are additional options for customer administrators. This includes password policies and user permission configuration. We provide support for thirdparty authentication, such as LDAP and SAML. All user passwords are encrypted, salted per user and hashed prior to storage.
All Phocas practices and processes are aligned to the security and protection of customer data. This includes operational and preparedness processes throughout the organization.
All our staff and contractors are fully vetted prior to employment, bound by non-disclosure agreements, and must follow agreed procedures when dealing with customer data. This is stated and enforced through approved policies for internal use of data (personal and company).
All access to data, including customer data, is strictly controlled on a needs or minimum access basis. Access to customer data can only be approved as a result of an application support request. Access to customer data is authorized and tracked via our internal ticketing systems. All access is logged and auditable.
We use structured change management processes and tools to ensure all access and changes are logged, approved and kept for audit purposes. This includes all updates to software and operating systems in the product and the platform.
We maintain company-wide business continuity and disaster recovery procedures, to ensure that in case of an incident, any impact on customers is minimal. These procedures rely on stringent backup policies and network redundancy plans, designed to ensure the efficient recovery of services and customer data, if required.
All processes are documented with identified roles and responsibilities for disaster recovery and incident response.
We perform regular (minimum 6 per year) disaster and incident response drills. The results of these drills are examined and learnings are used to continually improve processes.
Customer data is backed up daily and stored for up to 14 months in secure off-site, online storage.
We have the following standards for system recovery:
RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of four hours plus database build time
RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is one day
RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of eight hours plus database build time
RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is one week
To keep at the forefront of technology and security, we employ high-quality specialists in technology and security. Our main technical partners are Amazon Web Services (AWS) for support, infrastructure and security, and Armor for security monitoring.
We house all multi-tenant platform customers on multiple global
