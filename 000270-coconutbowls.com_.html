              The Sustainable Solution to Plastic Pollution
Every year billions of coconut shells are discarded and burned as waste, while our oceans suffer from the relentless onslaught of 8 million pieces of plastic pollution every single day. It's time for change. 
At Coconut Bowls, we have found the harmonious solution hidden within nature itself. We take these discarded coconut shells and transform them into beautiful bowls that are not only renewable, compostable, and durable but also make a powerful statement against the plastic pollution crisis.
Handcrafted with love into the perfect bowl. Embrace Coconut Bowls, nature's elegant answer to the plastic pollution crisis, and be part of a more sustainable future.
              Are we coconuts? Or can a bowl really change the world...
At the core of our mission is the belief that sustainability and innovation must go hand in hand. Since 2016, we've taken over 1,000,000 discarded waste items – such as coconut shells – and transformed them into practical, everyday products that are both beautiful and sustainable.
Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond the environment; we're dedicated to improving the livelihoods of rural artisans, coconut farmers, and their families in Vietnam and Indonesia. By harnessing the power of design and nature, we're creating a ripple effect of positive change that touches countless lives and communities.
Join us in our quest for a brighter, greener future, where every discarded waste item can be transformed into a masterpiece of sustainability and beauty.
Each time you reach for a Coconut Bowl, you ignite a positive ripple effect that spreads far beyond your kitchen. Your choice sends a powerful message to the world, inspiring others to reconsider their consumption habits and join the movement towards sustainability.
