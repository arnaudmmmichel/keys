University & Student Volunteering Opportunities | Vollie
 Student volunteering is about to change 
 It is absolutely vital for students to gain real-world experience during their studies. This expands their knowledge and increases their likelihood of employment immediately after graduating. Student volunteering will add valuable experience to their CV and LinkedIn profile, and give them an advantage over the competition, when they come to apply for a job with 100 applicants. Volunteer work for students is as valuable as an internship or work placement. 
Make no mistake, there is significant room for improvement from universities when it comes to providing volunteer work for students that is meaningful and effectively allows them to develop their new skills. An institution that is providing a suitable number of student volunteering opportunities, will attract more students and see the positive impact on retention rates.
An integrated skilled online volunteering program at your university presents the opportunity for your students to achieve three of the most important things to them.
Online volunteering in the age of Covid
Vollie understands that it is an unstable time for uni's in Australia right now, amidst the covid epidemic, but it's also a time to innovate and embrace new technology solutions to keep students engaged and get them job-ready.
