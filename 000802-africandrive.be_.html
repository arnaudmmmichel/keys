 Enabling sustainable value with communities in challenging circumstances.
Bouger et gagner ensemble, c’est bon!
The African Drive starting point is that we can all better our lives if the systems we count on for getting things done on a daily basis, can be more reliable, accessible and viable.
The reality however is that some communities in Africa have just been dealt a bad hand. We use a combination of business and entrepreneurship as force for doing good and since the 14th of December 2013, we have been at it in Benin. 
Our greatest source of satisfaction has been our ability to positively affect many lives. We have connected isolated and underserved communities supporting nearly 1000 people a day to develop their business and connect to the people they care for with a transportation system that is safer, affordable and more reliable. We also take pride in building a great local team of more than 260 people who have managed, in less than 6 years, to grow and become the biggest, safest and most reliable bus company in Benin. 
We believe in the empowerment of local teams, local managers and their collaborators for successful entrepreneurship in the long term.
We believe in intense collaboration with local  stakeholders – our customers, our suppliers, complementary transport providers such as the Taxi Moto, the communities in which we are active and their leaders.
We believe in operational discipline, as well at the level of our daily services, as in the maintenance of our equipment and infrastructure, and certainly in accounting and financial operations.
Reinventing mobility for social progress in 
West Africa, with reliable bus services.

meta title:baobab express — African Drive

Baobab Express, created in 2013, was born with the aim to ensure safe and quality transport; accessible to Beninese populations. Although, it is a commercial enterprise, the objectives of its business model also contains a social and community dimension. 
, Baobab Express stands for building reliable systems for communities, to move forward together. We seek to progress and provide safe and quality mobility for Beninese people while also keeping in mind the planet. 
After delivering proof that we can build sustainable business, we now want to accelerate growth and amplify our reach to even more people in Benin. That is we propose to use the recently approved capital increase of African Drive to strengthen the existing network by reinforcing strong lines with more appropriate equipment and expanding our reach to other communities that live in isolated areas and under difficult circumstances.
Baobab Express, is currently the only bus company that has national coverage, covering more than 12.000 km daily, and we choose not only to serve lines that have the most profit potential, but also lines connecting communities where these services are scarce.
Baobab Express headquarters is equipped with a large fuel tank and all fuel delivered to the tanks is tested and filtered. Fuel tanks on the buses are locked and the lines are organized so that the buses can only be refueled under controlled circumstances.
On average, Baobab Express takes 1100 passengers daily to their destinations, at affordable prices, safe and on time. Clients prefer our services because they can rely on punctuality, security & comfort.
We take pride in building a great local team of more than 
 years, to grow and become the 
, safest and most reliable bus company in Benin.
Every operational bus has a preventive maintenance check upon return to its base. A preventive maintenance program is in place to maintain the buses in the best possible condition. We also have a specialized team of mechanics who are equipped to perform complex repairs.
Our buses are equipped with wifi. Many clients do not have wifi in their homes, so many love to come on our buses so that they can use this service in particular.
Not only are our buses brand new and comfortable but they are also clean. The buses are cleaned every night after returning to the central station or one of the few stops where they pass the night. 
About 10% of revenue today comes from parcel services, where the government institutions such as local administrations, police services and courts are among the most regular customers, because of Baobab Express’s reliability.

Benin suffers from extremely poor air quality and has an economy that generates little added value. On top of that the average access rate to electricity is around 30%. 
 builds a new ecosystem which will use high capacity batteries to help improve air quality and access to electricity. 
The core of Baobab energie is a versatile battery which can be used to power both high power electric motorbikes  (48V) and household devices like light, smartphones, fridges, computers running on 12V. 
value adding activities like battery assembly and solar energy generation will help Benin to generate capital within its borders. With petrol driven motorbikes, all is imported from neighbouring countries. 
 builds this ecosystem in collaboration between technical  experts and local institutions. Just like Baobab Express the goal is to set up a profitable company fully managed by local people. 
 has the potential to be deployed in other countries in Africa. 
The majority of people own a motorbike or use zemidjan (ZEM) motorbike taxi’s to move around in towns and rural areas. All motorbikes currently use
80% of all petrol is smuggled from Nigeria. this 
 petrol contains heavy metals after distillation, resulting in high air pollution.
Petrol transporters, also known as “human bombs” carry up to 400L on their motorbike. 
The slightest accident involving one of these drivers can cause hundreds of deaths in a built-up area. An explosion in Cotonou in 2006, killed almost a hundred people and injured dozens. 
Our Batteries can be charged  both via the grid as via the  universal solar panel sockets. we are 
compatible with over 90% of all solar panels on the market
Solar panel charging without the need for an external adapter allows to recharge anywhere. this freedom will be disruptive for both energy supply to households, as the independency from fuel supply. for heavy users we offer battery swapping at our bus stops. 
Best value for money battery cell 
the sweet spot for value for money. Using advanced Lab’s in Belgium and no-nonsense input from Benin, we managed to hit the sweet spot.
. Mobile money grows exponentially in Benin. The many small transactions when users pay for energy through battery usage are difficult to manage with cash. Mobile money is also a great alternative for micro credits: Pre-financing can be done on shorter terms with lower rates, since we can enable / disable the batteries in case of no payment. 
Our IOT technology allows to follow the batteries closely anytime, anywhere 
Made to swap, Built to last
Our  batteries are tradeable per load cycle, but owned by a central company. This centralization ensures that the batteries will be 
 in different phases of their lifecycle. Our digital products makes sure we can control our ecosystem well. yet, even for drivers without smartphone we have a solution. 
Currently we have 30 motorbikes in use.  
We have taxi drivers who lease the motorbike and battery from Baobab energie.  
Experts from belgium coach local people to increase technology knowhow.
