The following Whistleblower Policy has been established to provide guidance to Alinea International employees and sub-contractors on how to deal with known or suspected improper conduct within the organization. The objectives of this Policy are to:
Create awareness of the Policy and available whistleblower protections
Act as a reference guide to potential whistleblowers wishing to make a disclosure
Define the structure of the whistleblower system, including reporting and investigation procedures, whistleblower protections, and confidentiality, among others
Improve the communication and transparency in the processes associated with whistleblowing and assure protection against derogatory consequences, namely reprisals and detrimental action
Complement the current communication channels between employees, sub-contractors and immediate managers, and hierarchical channels flowing to the President and Senior Management team
Provide guidance to all parties involved in either whistleblowing or whistleblower protection.
Alinea requires all employees and sub-contractors to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. All employees and sub-contractors of Alinea are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations of Canada and the countries where we operate. Any allegations of known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources will be dealt with in accordance with this Policy, and reasonable steps will be taken to protect those who come forward with allegations.
Alinea’s Whistleblower Policy covers both internal and external whistleblowing, and establishes the controls and procedures for dealing with allegations of malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is intended to encourage employees and sub-contractors to report known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources and to enable Alinea’s Senior Management team to address and correct inappropriate action.
It is the responsibility of all Board of Directors’ members, the Senior Management team, employees and sub-contractors to report concerns about known or suspected malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is applicable to all employees and sub-contractors of Alinea International.
Alinea recognizes the value of transparency and accountability in its administrative and management practices and supports the making of disclosures that reveal improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources.
Our internal controls and operating procedures are intended to detect and prevent malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations. As detailed in Alinea’s Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals, employees and sub-contractors are encouraged to share complaints and/or concerns regarding ethical or legal violations with their immediate managers. If the employee or sub-contractor is not comfortable speaking with their immediate manager or is not satisfied with the response, they are encouraged to speak with the Gatineau or Calgary Office Managers, the Vice Presidents or, as required, the Chief Financial Officer.
All members of the Senior Management team are required to report complaints and/or concerns about suspected ethical or legal violations in writing to Alinea’s Ethics Committee who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints and/or concerns. In the event that the complaint and/or concern is about the President, it should be raised by the employee or sub-contractor to their immediate manager or the Ethics Committee who will determine how the investigation will proceed.
All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective measures will be taken if warranted by the investigation. Alinea’s Ethics Committee is responsible for acknowledging receipt of the suspected violation and notifying the whistleblower of the outcome of the investigation.
Anyone filing a written complaint concerning suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Personal grievances or complaints related to employment are not covered under Alinea’s Whistleblowing Policy. For cases such as this, employees and sub-contractors are advised to first refer to Alineas Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals when considering a disclosure under the Whistleblowing Policy. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.
Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to ensure reprisals are not made against the whistleblower. Alinea is committed to safeguarding the identity of the whistleblower and to protecting the whistleblower against detrimental action taken in reprisal for allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources. The Ethics Committee is responsible for ensuring whistleblowers are protected from direct and indirect detrimental action, and that the culture of the workplace is supportive of suspected allegations being made. Any employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.
Alinea is committed to implementing ‘best practice’ policies and procedures for dealing with allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources (as defined by this Policy) and the management and protection of whistleblowers making allegation(s).
This Policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it meets the objectives of relevant legislation and remains effective for Alinea, and may be changed at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time.
For allegations of fraud, securities law, or human rights concerns, or when you are not satisfied or uncomfortable with following the Company’s open door policy, individuals should contact the Company’s Ethics Committee directly.

The following Whistleblower Policy has been established to provide guidance to Alinea International employees and sub-contractors on how to deal with known or suspected improper conduct within the organization. The objectives of this Policy are to:
Create awareness of the Policy and available whistleblower protections
Act as a reference guide to potential whistleblowers wishing to make a disclosure
Define the structure of the whistleblower system, including reporting and investigation procedures, whistleblower protections, and confidentiality, among others
Improve the communication and transparency in the processes associated with whistleblowing and assure protection against derogatory consequences, namely reprisals and detrimental action
Complement the current communication channels between employees, sub-contractors and immediate managers, and hierarchical channels flowing to the President and Senior Management team
Provide guidance to all parties involved in either whistleblowing or whistleblower protection.
Alinea requires all employees and sub-contractors to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. All employees and sub-contractors of Alinea are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations of Canada and the countries where we operate. Any allegations of known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources will be dealt with in accordance with this Policy, and reasonable steps will be taken to protect those who come forward with allegations.
Alinea’s Whistleblower Policy covers both internal and external whistleblowing, and establishes the controls and procedures for dealing with allegations of malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is intended to encourage employees and sub-contractors to report known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources and to enable Alinea’s Senior Management team to address and correct inappropriate action.
It is the responsibility of all Board of Directors’ members, the Senior Management team, employees and sub-contractors to report concerns about known or suspected malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is applicable to all employees and sub-contractors of Alinea International.
Alinea recognizes the value of transparency and accountability in its administrative and management practices and supports the making of disclosures that reveal improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources.
Our internal controls and operating procedures are intended to detect and prevent malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations. As detailed in Alinea’s Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals, employees and sub-contractors are encouraged to share complaints and/or concerns regarding ethical or legal violations with their immediate managers. If the employee or sub-contractor is not comfortable speaking with their immediate manager or is not satisfied with the response, they are encouraged to speak with the Gatineau or Calgary Office Managers, the Vice Presidents or, as required, the Chief Financial Officer.
All members of the Senior Management team are required to report complaints and/or concerns about suspected ethical or legal violations in writing to Alinea’s Ethics Committee who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints and/or concerns. In the event that the complaint and/or concern is about the President, it should be raised by the employee or sub-contractor to their immediate manager or the Ethics Committee who will determine how the investigation will proceed.
All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective measures will be taken if warranted by the investigation. Alinea’s Ethics Committee is responsible for acknowledging receipt of the suspected violation and notifying the whistleblower of the outcome of the investigation.
Anyone filing a written complaint concerning suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Personal grievances or complaints related to employment are not covered under Alinea’s Whistleblowing Policy. For cases such as this, employees and sub-contractors are advised to first refer to Alineas Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals when considering a disclosure under the Whistleblowing Policy. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.
Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to ensure reprisals are not made against the whistleblower. Alinea is committed to safeguarding the identity of the whistleblower and to protecting the whistleblower against detrimental action taken in reprisal for allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources. The Ethics Committee is responsible for ensuring whistleblowers are protected from direct and indirect detrimental action, and that the culture of the workplace is supportive of suspected allegations being made. Any employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.
Alinea is committed to implementing ‘best practice’ policies and procedures for dealing with allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources (as defined by this Policy) and the management and protection of whistleblowers making allegation(s).
This Policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it meets the objectives of relevant legislation and remains effective for Alinea, and may be changed at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time.
For allegations of fraud, securities law, or human rights concerns, or when you are not satisfied or uncomfortable with following the Company’s open door policy, individuals should contact the Company’s Ethics Committee directly.

The following Whistleblower Policy has been established to provide guidance to Alinea International employees and sub-contractors on how to deal with known or suspected improper conduct within the organization. The objectives of this Policy are to:
Create awareness of the Policy and available whistleblower protections
Act as a reference guide to potential whistleblowers wishing to make a disclosure
Define the structure of the whistleblower system, including reporting and investigation procedures, whistleblower protections, and confidentiality, among others
Improve the communication and transparency in the processes associated with whistleblowing and assure protection against derogatory consequences, namely reprisals and detrimental action
Complement the current communication channels between employees, sub-contractors and immediate managers, and hierarchical channels flowing to the President and Senior Management team
Provide guidance to all parties involved in either whistleblowing or whistleblower protection.
Alinea requires all employees and sub-contractors to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. All employees and sub-contractors of Alinea are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations of Canada and the countries where we operate. Any allegations of known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources will be dealt with in accordance with this Policy, and reasonable steps will be taken to protect those who come forward with allegations.
Alinea’s Whistleblower Policy covers both internal and external whistleblowing, and establishes the controls and procedures for dealing with allegations of malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is intended to encourage employees and sub-contractors to report known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources and to enable Alinea’s Senior Management team to address and correct inappropriate action.
It is the responsibility of all Board of Directors’ members, the Senior Management team, employees and sub-contractors to report concerns about known or suspected malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is applicable to all employees and sub-contractors of Alinea International.
Alinea recognizes the value of transparency and accountability in its administrative and management practices and supports the making of disclosures that reveal improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources.
Our internal controls and operating procedures are intended to detect and prevent malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations. As detailed in Alinea’s Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals, employees and sub-contractors are encouraged to share complaints and/or concerns regarding ethical or legal violations with their immediate managers. If the employee or sub-contractor is not comfortable speaking with their immediate manager or is not satisfied with the response, they are encouraged to speak with the Gatineau or Calgary Office Managers, the Vice Presidents or, as required, the Chief Financial Officer.
All members of the Senior Management team are required to report complaints and/or concerns about suspected ethical or legal violations in writing to Alinea’s Ethics Committee who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints and/or concerns. In the event that the complaint and/or concern is about the President, it should be raised by the employee or sub-contractor to their immediate manager or the Ethics Committee who will determine how the investigation will proceed.
All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective measures will be taken if warranted by the investigation. Alinea’s Ethics Committee is responsible for acknowledging receipt of the suspected violation and notifying the whistleblower of the outcome of the investigation.
Anyone filing a written complaint concerning suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Personal grievances or complaints related to employment are not covered under Alinea’s Whistleblowing Policy. For cases such as this, employees and sub-contractors are advised to first refer to Alineas Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals when considering a disclosure under the Whistleblowing Policy. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.
Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to ensure reprisals are not made against the whistleblower. Alinea is committed to safeguarding the identity of the whistleblower and to protecting the whistleblower against detrimental action taken in reprisal for allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources. The Ethics Committee is responsible for ensuring whistleblowers are protected from direct and indirect detrimental action, and that the culture of the workplace is supportive of suspected allegations being made. Any employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.
Alinea is committed to implementing ‘best practice’ policies and procedures for dealing with allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources (as defined by this Policy) and the management and protection of whistleblowers making allegation(s).
This Policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it meets the objectives of relevant legislation and remains effective for Alinea, and may be changed at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time.
For allegations of fraud, securities law, or human rights concerns, or when you are not satisfied or uncomfortable with following the Company’s open door policy, individuals should contact the Company’s Ethics Committee directly.

Act as a reference guide to potential whistleblowers wishing to make a disclosure
Define the structure of the whistleblower system, including reporting and investigation procedures, whistleblower protections, and confidentiality, among others
Improve the communication and transparency in the processes associated with whistleblowing and assure protection against derogatory consequences, namely reprisals and detrimental action

Provide guidance to all parties involved in either whistleblowing or whistleblower protection.
Alinea requires all employees and sub-contractors to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the conduct of their duties and responsibilities. All employees and sub-contractors of Alinea are required to comply with applicable laws and regulations of Canada and the countries where we operate. Any allegations of known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources will be dealt with in accordance with this Policy, and reasonable steps will be taken to protect those who come forward with allegations.
Alinea’s Whistleblower Policy covers both internal and external whistleblowing, and establishes the controls and procedures for dealing with allegations of malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is intended to encourage employees and sub-contractors to report known or suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources and to enable Alinea’s Senior Management team to address and correct inappropriate action.
It is the responsibility of all Board of Directors’ members, the Senior Management team, employees and sub-contractors to report concerns about known or suspected malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is applicable to all employees and sub-contractors of Alinea International.
Alinea recognizes the value of transparency and accountability in its administrative and management practices and supports the making of disclosures that reveal improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources.
Our internal controls and operating procedures are intended to detect and prevent malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations. As detailed in Alinea’s Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals, employees and sub-contractors are encouraged to share complaints and/or concerns regarding ethical or legal violations with their immediate managers. If the employee or sub-contractor is not comfortable speaking with their immediate manager or is not satisfied with the response, they are encouraged to speak with the Gatineau or Calgary Office Managers, the Vice Presidents or, as required, the Chief Financial Officer.
All members of the Senior Management team are required to report complaints and/or concerns about suspected ethical or legal violations in writing to Alinea’s Ethics Committee who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints and/or concerns.

Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to ensure reprisals are not made against the whistleblower. Alinea is committed to safeguarding the identity of the whistleblower and to protecting the whistleblower against detrimental action taken in reprisal for allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources. The Ethics Committee is responsible for ensuring whistleblowers are protected from direct and indirect detrimental action, and that the culture of the workplace is supportive of suspected allegations being made. Any employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.

meta title:Our Approach | Alinea International
meta description:We firmly believe that for development to create lasting change, partner-country stakeholders and beneficiaries must be empowered to claim it as their own. This belief guides our in-house technical experts in every step of their project management approach.

Climate Change, Humanitarian Resilience, & Response
We firmly believe that for development to create lasting change, partner-country stakeholders and beneficiaries must be empowered to claim it as their own. This belief guides our in-house technical experts in every step of their project management approach. From beginning to end, our project designs and implementation encourage participation and collaboration. We work with developing country partners at the outset to define goals and indicators, as well as at regular intervals throughout the project lifecycle.
At Alinea, we undertake project activities as a means to an end—results—and measure the success of our work on this basis. We do not consider project activities and inputs as sufficient in and of themselves—they have to produce developmental outcomes that respond to the stated needs of our clients and partners. We work with our partners to identify the results they want to achieve, reach consensus on the methodology for achieving them and together, we determine the roles and responsibilities each stakeholder needs to fulfill to reach goals and measure success. With desired results articulated and shared, we adjust activities and inputs so that developmental change can progress in a timely fashion.
A core Alinea capability is providing our clients with the information they require to finalize their decisions to start or expand their business, or to determine the feasibility of an investment or projected plan of action. Our technical specialists possess extensive industry experience and can conduct physical and economic feasibility studies, social/gender assessments, site assessments, industry analysis, environmental scans; and provide contacts with local and national governments
Alinea is strongly committed to a capacity development approach in our work. This means we design and implement our projects in a way that empowers our partners to set their own development goals, improve their ability to meet these goals, and continue to apply best practices and knowledge gained through the project long after it ends, and thus take charge of their own development path
Delivering good designs requires a creative process that draws upon the best available ideas, key stakeholder inputs and practical implementation approaches. A design must acknowledge the unique socio-cultural context, political economy and multiple priorities of diverse stakeholders, as well as demonstrate how to manage risk. Alinea delivers evidence-based designs tailored to client and partner needs, framed by the principles of RBM, user-friendly M&E frameworks and tools, appreciative inquiry and capacity building.
Characterized by participation, Alinea is committed to participatory MEL processes that build stakeholder ownership and support strong and enduring partnerships. Alinea develops user-friendly MEL products and services that provide clarity of purpose, a robust theory of change to guide implementation and effectively track results, and processes and products for learning and adaptive management. Alinea works with clients to develop and implement MEL approaches that are firmly aligned with the program design, and enable quality reporting on program impacts and results.
Alinea provides experienced and skilled facilitators to support clients to achieve inclusive, solution-focused outcomes. Types of workshops include Program Design; Organization and Strategic Planning; Theory of Change and Program Logic development; Multi-stakeholder partnership development; Reflect and Refocus learning workshops; M&E and performance indicator design; Consultation workshops; Annual Planning; Risk and risk management; and Data Parties and write-shops. Alinea ensures workshops produce clear outcomes and action plans that can be taken forward collaboratively by those involved.
Strategic advice considers every aspect of a project. It takes a holistic view of a client’s situation and addresses their total needs, both now and in the future. It is a value proposition based on ongoing advice
 coaching and mentoring to keep clients on track towards achieving their goals. Alinea conducts project reviews to identify key issues and barriers to provide effective solutions that support and enable change, working to build trust between key stakeholders and partners to recommend collaborative evidence based strategy.
Alinea applies an Adaptive Management methodology that integrates the type of learning that allows project teams and stakeholders to make informed decisions about future directions, and uses models that are agile and capable of responding to changing internal and external environments. Reflect and Refocus workshops bring together key program staff and stakeholders to analyze M&E data, reflect on changes in influence and stakeholders, critically assess the Theory of Change, identify strengths and weakness, and re-focus activities to adapt to changes, build on successes, and eliminate non-performing content.
 offers a range of services to our clients and partners, which can be provided on a stand-alone basis or combined in different ways within a larger project or program.
A core Alinea capability is providing our clients with the information they require to finalize their decisions to start or expand their business, or to determine the feasibility of an investment or projected plan of action. Our technical specialists possess extensive industry experience and can conduct physical and economic feasibility studies, social/gender assessments, site assessments, industry analysis, environmental scans; and provide contacts with local and national governments.
We believe that a successful project can usually be traced back to the effort, care and skill that were applied to its initial planning. Alinea has developed a methodology in planning and design that is framed by the principles of results-based management (RBM), appreciative inquiry, and capacity building, including: inclusion of local expertise; identifying and building on local successes; self-assessment practices; and participatory methodologies.
At Alinea, we undertake project activities as a means to an end—results—and measure the success of our work on this basis. We do not consider project activities and inputs as sufficient in and of themselves—they have to produce developmental outcomes that respond to the stated needs of our clients and partners. We work with our partners to identify the results they want to achieve, reach consensus on the methodology for achieving them and together, we determine the roles and responsibilities each stakeholder needs to fulfill to reach goals and measure success.

This means we design and implement our projects in a way that empowers our partners to set their own development goals, improve their ability to meet these goals, and continue to apply best practices and knowledge gained through the project long after it ends, and thus take charge of their own development path
Our approach to monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is characterized by participation: we work with stakeholders to look at both developmental results and success factors. We conduct an objective analysis of issues affecting performance including: achievement of results; cost effectiveness; relevance; sustainability; partnership; appropriateness of design; and resource utilization and timely action. We have developed and implemented numerous M&E frameworks for projects that we manage, and provided M&E services for other projects, programs and organizational assessments.
Every successful project must address issues related to gender equality, human rights, good governance and environmental sustainability. In all projects implemented by Alinea, we incorporate these themes and more.
Alinea works with local civil society organizations and experts, international NGOs, partner governments, donors, universities and colleges to strengthen local ownership of and participation in the decisions that affect lives and build community resilience.
As a feminist organization, Alinea applies a gender lens to all aspects of development programming to support clients and communities to address barriers to women’s empowerment and gender equality challenges – economic, socio-cultural and political.
Alinea works with all levels of government, civil society organizations and vulnerable communities to explore and identify the potential social and environmental impacts from development programs, positive and negative, to establish appropriate frameworks and action plans of management.
Recognizing inclusion as both a process and an outcome, Alinea works with clients to develop practical strategies to reach people with disabilities and other marginalized groups and ensure they benefit from development programming.
Alinea develops strategies to promote inclusive governance, and to inform and empower people living in poverty to know and act upon their rights. We provide expertise in the areas of public sector reform, systemic change, decentralization and civil society engagement, among others.
Sustainable development often involves change, which requires an understanding of existing political and economic power relationships. Alinea conducts analysis that places technical development issues within this broader political economy context to inform practical strategies.
Alinea works every day to identify and apply new ideas to meeting the world’s changing challenges. Our in-house technical experts incorporate innovative models and methods across their projects to deliver smart solutions that are at the forefront of development programming.
With a focus on supporting the most vulnerable, Alinea applies a systems thinking approach, considers future climate scenarios and integrates practical solutions into strategies and across programming to support resilient development and environmentally sustainable policy.

meta description:Stability, good governance and the rule of law is the foundation for the development of prosperous, inclusive and sustainable communities.

Climate Change, Humanitarian Resilience, & Response
Stability, good governance and the rule of law is the foundation for the development of prosperous, inclusive and sustainable communities. 
We use an integrated governance approach and follow a comprehensive capacity development process to support governance and public sector reform based on: inclusion and participation of people and service delivery; equity, equality and non-discrimination for all; transparency of processes and accountability towards people; efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector to fulfill its responsibilities; and capacity and responsiveness to the needs of the population.
Alinea has been providing support to peace and security operations in fragile and conflict-affected states for more than two decades. We have been involved in stabilization efforts in Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia in countries seeking sustained levels of peace and security. We have assisted in the transition to democracy by working with groups on reconciliation and helping communities develop through effective collaboration and stronger participation in law-making, development planning, as well as the advancement and inclusion of women.
Alinea works to promote the rule of law and improve access to justice. We provide advice and support to government partners, such as justice ministries and the judiciary; lead multi-stakeholder public policy dialogues; and create opportunities for information sharing about best practices and similar reform experiences around the world. We engage technical experts to assist in developing policies, related legal and regulatory frameworks and training to support reforms in accordance with international legal and human rights standards.
We are strong advocates in combating violence and promoting equal access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms for women, children and other vulnerable groups.
UKRAINE: Support to Ukraine’s Reform for Governance Project (Global Affairs Canada) 
Alinea’s Support to Ukraine’s Reform for Governance (SURGe) Project is supporting the Government of Ukraine (GoU) to deliver governance and economic reforms that better respond to the needs of its citizens, particularly women and girls. The project builds on previous investments made by Canada, including the Expert Deployment for Governance and Economic Growth (EDGE) Project implemented by Alinea to strengthen the GoU’s reform management functions. SURGe focuses on qualitative aspects of reform management by introducing and supporting the integration of citizen’s needs and requirements into planning and implementation processes to ensure that the different needs, interests and constraints of women/girls and men/boys are considered. Under SURGe, Alinea works with the Secretariat of the Cabinet of Ministers to strengthen its role as the country’s national reform agenda owner, building its capacity to guide, coordinate and direct government institutions as they work together on their respective reforms. Alinea is also building the capacity of key ministries, departments and agencies to plan and implement reforms through results based management (RBM) and gender-based analysis (GBA+) as process models to analyze, design and implement individual reform initiatives.
MONGOLIA: Strengthening Extractive Sector Management in Mongolia (Global Affairs Canada)
Through the Strengthening Extractive Sector Management in Mongolia (SESMIM) Project, Alinea will build the capacity of the Mongolian government for transparent and effective policy implementation supporting sustainable growth in the country’s extractive sector. Alinea will work hand-in-hand with the government of Mongolia and other key stakeholders to improve policy and regulatory frameworks, including increased capacity for policy development, improved implementation and coordination of policies and regulations between ministries and key industry stakeholders, and stronger, evidence-based decision making in extractive sector management that is gender sensitive and socially and environmentally sustainable. Additionally, public awareness and education programs involving hundreds of industry and civil society organizations will enhance understanding and social licence for the sector, while evidence-based pilot programs in monitoring and reporting will be carried out in rural mining communities, engaging populations of about 8,000 people in total, including women and youth. To achieve this capacity building program, Alinea will work directly with the Mongolian Ministry of Mining, Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism the and the Ministry of Finance, with additional input from the Government of Alberta, the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary and other service providers.
SOUTH SUDAN: Community Stabilization and Peace through Capacity Building (Global Affairs Canada)
In the South Sudanese counties of Pibor and Uror in Jonglei State, persistent communal and ethnic violence threaten peace and security. In response to this crisis, Alinea implemented the GAC-funded, Community Stabilization and Peace through Capacity Building project in order to enhance security and peaceful relations among community members and leaders by providing training for citizens on skills to heal trauma and reconcile conflict. Working with The Resource Centre for Civil Leadership (RECONCILE), the project organized capacity development activities in basic trauma healing, conflict reconciliation, community stabilization and the development of educational materials on conflict prevention. The diverse range of participants included community members, government administrators, police, chiefs, and headmen/headwomen. The project’s innovative use of broad-reaching educational materials and exchange visits led to improved dialogue, healing and mutual understanding.
SOUTHEAST ASIA REGION: Civil Society Scoping Study (The Asia Foundation & DFAT Australia)
Alinea was a principal researcher for the Civil Society Scoping Study led by The Asia Foundation. The aim of the seven country Civil Society Scoping Study was to refresh and update our understanding of civil society’s role in governance in Southeast Asia from both national and regional perspectives. The study aimed to identify key trends in the ways in which civil society is changing in each context, including through the use of social media and ways in which digital technology impacts on collective action. Finally, the study aimed to discern the areas in which civil society participate in regional (or global) networks and to what end. The first iteration of the resulting research papers will be internal to DFAT. With DFAT’s agreement, a second iteration of the research papers – and full research project – will be made public by TAF and the findings will be presented at Australian and international democracy and development conferences.

It is the responsibility of all Board of Directors’ members, the Senior Management team, employees and sub-contractors to report concerns about known or suspected malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations.
This Policy is applicable to all employees and sub-contractors of Alinea International.
Alinea recognizes the value of transparency and accountability in its administrative and management practices and supports the making of disclosures that reveal improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources.
Our internal controls and operating procedures are intended to detect and prevent malpractice, fraud and violations of our code of ethics and/or laws or regulations that govern our operations. As detailed in Alinea’s Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals, employees and sub-contractors are encouraged to share complaints and/or concerns regarding ethical or legal violations with their immediate managers. If the employee or sub-contractor is not comfortable speaking with their immediate manager or is not satisfied with the response, they are encouraged to speak with the Gatineau or Calgary Office Managers, the Vice Presidents or, as required, the Chief Financial Officer.
All members of the Senior Management team are required to report complaints and/or concerns about suspected ethical or legal violations in writing to Alinea’s Ethics Committee who has the responsibility to investigate all reported complaints and/or concerns. In the event that the complaint and/or concern is about the President, it should be raised by the employee or sub-contractor to their immediate manager or the Ethics Committee who will determine how the investigation will proceed.
All reports will be promptly investigated and appropriate corrective measures will be taken if warranted by the investigation. Alinea’s Ethics Committee is responsible for acknowledging receipt of the suspected violation and notifying the whistleblower of the outcome of the investigation.
Anyone filing a written complaint concerning suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources must be acting in good faith and have reasonable grounds for believing the information disclosed indicates a violation. Personal grievances or complaints related to employment are not covered under Alinea’s Whistleblowing Policy. For cases such as this, employees and sub-contractors are advised to first refer to Alineas Employee Policy and Onboarding manuals when considering a disclosure under the Whistleblowing Policy. Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.
Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to ensure reprisals are not made against the whistleblower. Alinea is committed to safeguarding the identity of the whistleblower and to protecting the whistleblower against detrimental action taken in reprisal for allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources. The Ethics Committee is responsible for ensuring whistleblowers are protected from direct and indirect detrimental action, and that the culture of the workplace is supportive of suspected allegations being made. Any employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.
Alinea is committed to implementing ‘best practice’ policies and procedures for dealing with allegations of suspected improper conduct or mismanagement of organizational resources (as defined by this Policy) and the management and protection of whistleblowers making allegation(s).
This Policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure it meets the objectives of relevant legislation and remains effective for Alinea, and may be changed at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time.
For allegations of fraud, securities law, or human rights concerns, or when you are not satisfied or uncomfortable with following the Company’s open door policy, individuals should contact the Company’s Ethics Committee directly.
