Our Mission — Silk Grass Farms, Belize
Founded in 2019 by social entrepreneurs Mandy Cabot and Peter Kjellerup in partnership with Belizean agribusiness leader and statesman Henry Canton, Silk Grass Farms reimagines agribusiness, merging agriculture with land stewardship and conservation to create a unique, durable model that benefits the environment and the people of Belize. 
Our vision is to support a thriving planet, alive with biodiversity and fulfilled, healthy people. To us, this means caring for the land in a way that enables it to flourish, while also generating the fresh food and economic value necessary to ensure good lives for the people involved. We seek to balance a large-scale, regenerative, and economically sustainable agribusiness with the conservation and protection of the rainforest ecosystem that is a critical part of Belize and the world. 
Silk Grass Farms consists of four working farms, located in the Stann Creek and Cayo districts of Belize, and a 130,000 square-foot food-processing factory that processes the harvest from our farms and other approved farms in Belize. Silk Grass Wildlife Preserve is a 24,700-acre first-growth rainforest, permanently protected as a Belizean NGO. Profits from the farms and factory are dedicated, in perpetuity, to the benefit of the 
To model a regenerative approach to agribusiness that is sustainable, replicable, and fair
A thriving planet, alive with biodiverse ecosystems, and happy, healthy people
Silk Grass Farms is sculpted around five sturdy pillars that, together, uphold our mission, vision, and values.
Our regenerative farming practices leverage the earth’s natural systems to cultivate a diverse collection of perennial and annual food crops—citrus fruits, coconuts, cacao, mangoes, watermelons, avocados, and more. Our holistic approach to farming enables longer grass cycles, responsible water management, healthy and biodiverse soils, and reforestation with native hardwood trees.
Our state-of-the-art, commercial-scale food processing facility enables us to process and package the bounty of our farms and partner farms onsite. Built for optimal energy efficiency and waste reduction, the factory adds value to our raw materials and enables us to create the highest-quality food and personal care products, all while energizing the local economy.
Our line of pure, natural products begins with all things coconut — oil, water, milk, cream, flour — and extends to cold-pressed juice blends, fruit purees, essential and fragrance oils, skin and hair products, honey, and more. Profits from sales of Silk Grass Farms products support the Silk Grass Wildlife Preserve.
The Silk Grass Wildlife Preserve incorporates and protects 24,700 acres of a unique, biodiverse wildlife corridor bridging the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary to the south, the Sittee River Forest Preserve to the west, and Bocawina Mayflower National Park to the north. The result is a contiguous protected area of more than 1.2 million acres.
Much like nature's interconnected web of life, our vision is built and realized by a diverse and energetic group of individuals.

The Silk Grass family of farms grows a diverse collection of perennial and annual crops—coconuts, citrus fruits, cacao, watermelons, avocado, and more, across 9,000 acres in the foothills of the Maya Mountains.
We are committed to farming practices that restore our relationship with nature, regenerate the soil, heal the land, and reverse climate change. We are harnessing the power of our agriculture to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, simultaneously building climate resilience and ecological health. Using an innovative and sustainable food production model, we are working to remedy some of our most pressing climate and biodiversity issues. 
Silk Grass Farms has joined the global movement to change the way our modern food systems treat food — from farm to table. Our model works to revive food from a faceless commodity with no distinguishing traits, to a colorful, living story of nutrition, nature, and people.
Silk Grass Farms was founded on the belief that conservation and business are allies, bonded interdependently to shared outcomes. Our land ethic reflects this belief, prioritizing land stewardship that protects, regenerates, and heals our soil while simultaneously increasing productivity. Our key guiding principles are:
We are following nature's lead when it comes to planning, nurturing, and safeguarding our ecosystems. We let the land's natural variations and microclimates tell us what to plant, how to manage water, and how to develop infrastructure in a way that works with — and not against — nature. 
We operate on the principle of "doing more with less" in all aspects of our business to ensure the protection of our precious resources. This means maximizing the utility of our land and resources to extract only what is necessary. When possible, we intercrop and plant ground cover to retain moisture, organic matter, and fertility in our soils. Radically increasing resource productivity stops resource depletion at one end of the value chain and reduces waste at the other.  
Protecting biodiversity and supporting strong, thriving ecosystems not only mitigates risks but also increases productivity. We plant a variety of crops to diversify our production and complement various land contours and soil types. 
The practices we use to grow crops can either pump carbon into the sky or put it back in the ground, where it belongs. It largely comes down to how we treat our soil: a healthy world is dependent on healthy soil. At Silk Grass Farms, we use cultivation methods designed to build soil health.
: By repurposing post-production biomass, we eliminate the very idea of waste. Those products that do not degrade back into natural nutrient cycles can be repurposed as ingredients for other processes and products. 
Our goal is to be carbon neutral by 2030. Learn more about our long-term vision to scale regenerative agriculture in our
