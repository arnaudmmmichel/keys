Sustainable Development Principles - Artibus Innovation

Artibus Innovation is committed to sustainable development principles, and seeks opportunities to enact these principles both within vocational training and education and its business practices.
The focus on sustainable development is intensifying across the globe, in industry and society alike.  Sustainable development has implications in all areas of social and economic development, and presents significant opportunities for the education and vocational training systems. Some work has been done in identifying how to incorporate sustainability into some qualifications in the VET system, but this has not yet occurred at a systemic level.  Sustainability, as an objective, has always been present within education, but its recognition and articulation has advanced significantly as a result of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Due to its broad applicability to the Australian workforce, VET is ideally placed to incorporate sustainable development principles and practices in an effective, efficient and enduring manner.
Over the last six months we’ve been exploring the applicability of United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to the built environment. This is particularly relevant, as: 
Download the Sustainable Development in Vocational Education Report
The built environment accounts for 22% of the world’s sustainability problems (Journal of sustainability research, 2019, Hapres)
The World Economic forum (2019) notes that awareness of the UN SDGs in Australia is on par with the European countries of Holland and Germany.
Sustainable development has many aspects - it’s not just environmental, but also social, economic, etc. 
Sustainable development is coming - Australia is a signatory to the UN SDGs 
Industry and government need to consider how to achieve SDG’s both generally and in the workforce setting. Challenges need to be met by industry and government to achieve SDG’s for the workforce 
The vet system has clearly identifiable elements that can support achieving SDG’s 
There is a business return on investment from achieving SDG’s
Sustainable development is a wicked problem – one that cannot be approached in isolation, but requires society, industry and Government to work together.  
Artibus Innovation is leading thinking on sustainable development in the workforce of the built environment.  We have been sponsoring co-design workshops with industry peak bodies from the property services sector as part of our Industry Skills Forecast activity. What we have discovered so far is that there is an appetite for this discussion and that education has a huge part to play.

Demand and Benefits Report, International Skills Training in Construction
Artibus Innovation undertook a Demand and Benefits Analysis of international skills training in Construction for the Commonwealth Department of Education and Training (international) in 2019. Construction skills training needs were assessed across nine countries across South East Asia and the Pacific. The assessment detailed potential demand for the development and delivery of international education programs under the International Skills Training Program.
This project involved the development of accredited course in split system air-conditioning cleaning for Air Hygiene Training.  Working with industry specialists we developed units of competency that were packaged into a short course, accredited by the Australian Skills and Qualifications Authority (ASQA) on the national register.
In 2018 we were contracted by the Department of Planning Transport and Infrastructure in South Australia to review the efficiency and effectiveness of it's Enterprise Registered Training Organisation (ERTO). In consultation with stakeholders we developed an evaluation methodology and undertook a cost benefit analysis of the ERTO’s operations.

Certificate II in Renewable Energy Pathways
Tasmania is rapidly moving to a renewable energy future. This is a pivot point for the state economy, and one that builds upon the legacy of the hydroelectric scheme. Green hydrogen, pumped hydro and wind power will form the future mix of energy output to create market opportunity. Projected job gains and skill requirements will necessitate strong engagement with the education sectors and community to generate enthusiasm for, and awareness of, the many opportunities emerging. Within this context, Artibus Innovation was funded by the Tasmanian Government to develop a hydrogen ready training course that will build a pipeline of new industry entrants.
The 11136NAT Certificate II in Renewable Energy Pathways has been approved by ASQA, starting 22 of November, 2022.
The course will help establish a pathway and certification for new entrants to participate in the renewables industry. The development of the course required extensive consultation, locally and nationally and provides a start in a career across five industries that underpin the renewables industry.

Artibus Innovation would like to thank the Tasmanian Government who funded the development of the hydrogen ready training course. With the course now approved by ASQA, the State Government has asked 
SDG Align to manage the course on its behalf
Artibus Innovation acknowledges the support of the Department of State Growth, Tasmania as part of the Commonwealth funded Energising Tasmania project.
This project has had 4673 visitors.
