Our own contrarians, whether core team or advisors, have been trusted to work on complex problems with progressive brands to chart their future.
Working with those refusing to play it safe.

We believe in rooting our research in human-centred design and community knowledge. We dive deep into a problem to answer critical questions, uncover meaningful insights, and turn insights into action.

We use a range of proven processes, from design sprints to co-creation workshops, to help our clients uncover answers to challenging problems. As you embark on a new challenge, we will work with you to define a clear roadmap, design an intuitive experience, and establish solutions for both short-term advantages and long-term success.
We uncover social, cultural and behavioural insights, looking inside and out.
We use Google Ventures’ battle-tested process to design a great experience, answer a critical business question, or even launch an MVP — in days, rather than months.

No matter your industry, we understand your users. Our process dives into what your audience wants, how you compare to the rest of the flock, and what you can do to differentiate your brand.

Meet Counterbrace: To go where others won't, or can't?
A brand is a wieldable tool that empowers you to guide your choices, guard your reputation, and grow your equity. With the right anchors, a healthy brand can elevate you from being defined simply by what you do to being understood for the role that you want to play in the world.
Building a strong, strategic brand can be one of your greatest assets, whether you’re a purpose-led business or global nonprofit. It helps you stand out from the crowd, amplifies your message to a larger audience, and attracts passionate users or supporters. We’ll work with you to define a brand position and narrative that offers your brand plenty of space to influence, communicate, and connect with others, grounded in cultural insight and research. With our iterative, collaborative process, we’ll then help you to creatively articulate your brand expression through a market-ready identity and defined visual language for an owned suite of initiatives.
We help your brand find its true expression through strategic thinking and design implementation.
Through strategic positioning, a brand strategy can elevate you from being defined by what you do to being understood for the role you want to play in the world.
A narrative strategy ensures that a desired message or story is conveyed in the most meaningful and enduring way. Without this synthesis between action and words, you lose authenticity and credibility.
A strategic approach to naming in a brand process can be the difference between equity and obscurity. By building out a brand purpose before undertaking a naming session, we can help you get your brand name right.
We create a brand identity true to your developed brand strategy, leveraging our knowledge of category conventions and out-of-category inspiration.
In the brand identity development process, we put together rules and guidelines for you to start understanding how you can articulate your brand, enshrining them in an easy-to-use document.
With an established identity in place, we’ll develop a range of assets as example activations, from business cards to drop cards and packaging.

We’ll kick off the work together, reviewing our approach and process, shared vision of success, and outputs at the end of the journey.
To gain an understanding what you do today and the ambitious ideas you have for the future, we facilitate discovery conversations with your stakeholders to ensure their participation.
With a grounding in the brand and industry category, we dig deeper through analogous industry research, cultural trend exploration, competitive whitespace analysis, and more.
After the initial discovery, we develop brand territories, representative of spaces that could be developed into a single-minded purpose for your brand.
With the new brand purpose in hand, we’ll kick off brand identity exploration and development, leveraging our experience and knowledge of category conventions and drawing inspiration from aspirational out-of-category analogues and leaders.
With an established direction in place, we’ll maintain momentum of your new brand by ideating new thought-starters, designing visual assets, and more.

To gain a better understanding of where you are and what you’re imagining for the future, we’ll start with an audit of your web properties and align on a clear path forward.
As part of our human-centred design process, we’ll facilitate in-depth UX workshops to understand your target users’ requirements, expectations, and typical digital habits.
Any great digital experience starts with a clear user journey, site infrastructure, and wireframes. Before we pick up our digital paintbrush, we’ll map out a cohesive, intuitive experience for your website.
After setting a solid base for the site, it’s time to fill in all the details. We’ll prototype a high-fidelity design of your website that can be used to get feedback from stakeholders or even users.
With a clear understanding of your vision, users’ needs, and the expected outcome, we’ll turn our prototype into a reality — a live, pixel-perfect digital experience that you’ll be proud to put your name on.

Compelling content builds brand equity, educates potential consumers, and drives them to your website. More importantly, it builds trust with people. We write content and produce visuals that are evergreen. Blog posts, copywriting, ebooks, white papers, illustrations, infographics, videos —  the kind that are informational and accessible.

We bring your stories to life through words and visuals.
We’ll put together a strategic content framework to attract, convert, and retain the people you’re looking to reach. Your content strategy will be documented to help guide your decision-making process.
We plan, write and edit content in the format that makes the most sense, from video scripts to email newsletters and keynote scripts.
While writing copy is an art, editing is the rigor behind the art. Beyond writing, we handle grammar, sentence structure, and the weight and meaning of content.
Video content can frame stories in a way that is raw, honest, and thoughtful. With our partners, we help you storyboard, shoot, edit, and finalise short films.
Illustrations help express ideas visually, clarify concepts, and even facilitate complex or tough conversations. We have in-house illustrators and often work with partner artists to produce what’s needed.
Photography can relay importance, lend credibility, and convey proximity in a way that words sometimes can’t. With our partners, we help you shoot, edit, and finalise images to supplement your content.
