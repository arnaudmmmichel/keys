meta title:Tickbox - Workspace
meta description:

Accessible anywhere, anytime on any device
Immediate access to enterprise level technologies
Total privacy, security, and accessibility of your data
Pay only for the software and resources you use
There comes a point for most businesses where the demands of managing your own IT interfere with day-to-day productivity. End-of-life systems. Unreliable apps. Inadequate security. Expanding costs. The list goes on.
Workspace from Tickbox is the ideal outsourced solution to your IT woes. Rather than buying, maintaining and supporting all your business applications yourself, you just tell us what you need, and we give you and your users fast and easy access to it, via our private cloud. And we host all your files too.
Of course, it’s all very familiar and easy to use. 
You just log in to your Workspace dashboard, and everything you normally use is there, ready to go.
 All your programs, all your files.
The only difference is you access it via the cloud, and you don’t have to buy, install, set up, maintain or support it. You don’t have to replace it, either. Workspace is always up to date with the latest technological innovations, working behind the scenes with total reliability 24/7.
All you have to do is get on with building your business.
When we developed Workspace, we did things right. Lightning speed, unfettered access, uncompromising security.
We built it, from the ground up, specifically to meet the needs of Australian Small to Medium Enterprises, providing instant high-performance across your entire organisation, at the desk or on the road, via the Tickbox private cloud.
Yet for all its technical achievements, Workspace remains incredibly intuitive and simple for end-users. We seamlessly bridge the gap between technology and your people.

Speedy access isn’t just for the desktop experience. Workspace operates equally impressively—and securely—anytime, anywhere, from any device.
Ease of use translates into improved staff engagement and productivity, which in turn means a boost to operational efficiencies. And if you find your business growing (due in part, no doubt, to those efficiencies), Workspace is totally scalable at a moment’s notice.

We don’t make claims lightly. So when we say we believe Tickbox’s cloud technology to be among the most secure in Australia, we mean it. This is partly because we limit the number of users in what we call PODS, with each pod having its own infrastructure and support team—real people looking after things around the clock. It’s also partly because of our absolute commitment to maintaining state-of-the-art technology and processes.
Total reliability, extensive backup, and full disaster recovery are just part of the service. In all our years of operation, we’ve never let a customer down. And we won’t let you down either.

In many cases, your staff can be migrated across to Workspace over the weekend. Shut down on Friday on the obsolete system, and log in seamlessly on Monday to a hassle-free IT world. Disruption due to IT issues is a thing of the past when you outsource to Workspace.
Still, there may be times when a staff member has a question or request, and needs an expert to talk to. Tickbox’s customer support staff, based locally in Melbourne, Australia, are available 24/7 to address any and all needs, via remote phone support or on-site when required. It’s a rare occurrence that they’re needed, however, as 90% of problems never happen thanks to Workspace’s elegant architecture.

Your apps should work for you. You should never have to work for your apps.
Tickbox gives you access to a full suite of proven performers in the app landscape. They’re already built, already helping Small to Medium Enterprises Australia-wide get the very most out of their productivity in the office, and in the marketplace. Because of this, you get the most value for your dollar, too. You pay for existing tech, and you only pay for what you use.
When we deploy an app, there’s no tricky set-up involved. All you have to do is click to gain access—from anywhere, any time, on any device. Email, security and virus protection, workflow, browsing, filters, printing, spreadsheets... All at your fingertips from day one, all working flawlessly, and freeing you up to explore more business opportunities.
Sometimes you need an application that’s specific to your business or industry. And sometimes those apps have a reputation for not playing nicely with system integration. Not any more.
Tickbox has the technical expertise to integrate any app into our systems. We can cloudify your custom apps, and ensure total stability. Across the board, your apps or ours, we can tweak the technology to ensure you get the fastest access and performance available.

The whole reason for our being is so that you’ll never have to worry over IT issues again.

Phone. Email. Social. Too many businesses get far too little out of their mobile devices. But that all changes with Tickbox.
Our mobility services provide end-to-end Mobile Device Management, allowing you to get more out of your entire mobile ‘fleet’ than you ever thought possible. In essence, you’ll be able to access everything you normally would in the office, on any device, in any location, at any time.
Whatever platform you use, however many devices your employees have, Tickbox brings it all together under one easy-to-use system. We clearly outline what can and can’t be done across your mobile network, and optimise access to all of your vital apps and comms with the speed and performance you’re accustomed to.
Of course, security is paramount to the process. Taking your workplace mobile adds a new level of vulnerability to your activities. Our expertise and proven Tier 3 security features, however, ensure a level of privacy and reliability that affords total peace of mind, wherever business takes you.

Tier 3 or Tier 2 security
                Take security to the next level
All the best features in the world mean nothing if your data’s security isn’t even better.
First and foremost, Tickbox is dedicated to the absolute integrity of your data and business operations. We have state-of-the-art smart systems—and very smart people—in place to ensure multi-faceted security across the entire network.
Don’t be misled—simply outsourcing data to the cloud isn’t enough anymore. You need somebody with credited expertise to work with you in a true partnership to keep your data—and your customers' data—safe.
When we built our private cloud network, we housed it locally in Melbourne, using the highest standard of hardware available. Data sovereignty—having it in data centres we can see, feel and manage—is the vital first step to a truly great security job.
Our data centre design features Pods, or manageable clusters of client data so that the system never becomes overloaded. As we expand with new clients and more data, it’s simply a matter of introducing new Pods rather than piling on to one or two overworked systems. Our data centres are ISO certified, meaning they’re recognised to an international standard.
Do we have Defence-grade security? No. Defence-grade (‘Tier 4’) security brings with it performance negatives that outweigh the security positives. We do, however, use Tier 3, just one level below. It features double fail over protection for your data—that is, even were we to suffer two simultaneous critical system failures, your data remains safe, and you’ll never notice anything happened.
Of course, we don’t shoehorn you into Tier 3 security if it’s not warranted. 
Tier 2 is also available should you prefer.

Digital security exists in a rapidly evolving landscape. Keeping up with new laws and compliance obligations can be confusing. So why not allow Tickbox to take all that off your plate?
We actively assist you to meet GDPR compliance internationally, and PCI compliance here in Australia. We also look after all your requirements for our most recent privacy laws, including mandatory breach notifications.

The best thing about our security? You’ll barely have to give it a second thought. Go and build your business while our systems and safeguards take care of your data integrity. Of course, we’ll still be consulting with you on security matters from time to time to make sure we’re on track with your business goals, and we’ll even happily conduct security awareness training for your staff.

All levels of user catered for
People. They say good ones are hard to find. What they don’t always say, though, is that with the right training your people can optimise the use of your IT systems and, with it, productivity.
What Tickbox won’t do is just implement your technology then walk away and leave you to it. We want you to get the most out of your IT, so we spend as much time as necessary to train and educate your staff in the subtle arts of technology use.
Tickbox helps you manage the skills of your workforce and apply them deftly to your systems and processes. We can proactively identify knowledge gaps and strategically fill them with all the knowledge that’s required.
We train people in application use as well as in navigating your system’s set-up. No more saving files in the wrong drives under the wrong names. By taking the time to provide simple solutions to everyday IT problems, we empower your staff to learn, grow and shine.

Not only will you get the learning solutions you need from us, you’ll probably also get the occasional joke or anecdote—though we can’t make any assurances as to the quality of the latter two.
