STREAMS OF TODAY, POWERED BY RENEWABLE ENERGY.

Creating the advanced food ingredients & biomaterials needed for our future using the food waste streams of today, powered by renewable energy.
Making the world’s most sustainable protein concentrate and specialty flour
We believe science & technology can help solve the sustainability grand challenges of our generation. Over 1.3 billion tonnes of food waste biomass is produced each year, whilst simultaneously over 700 million people are undernourished. It’s madness. Consumers want healthier, more sustainable, interesting foods. Consumers want biodegradable bioplastics and sustainable textiles. We bioprospect and mine traditional food waste streams using our advanced foodtech and biotech to help create the most valuable products possible, prioritising food creation, and displacing unsustainable alternatives.
We are starting with grain byproducts, particularly brewers spent grain, where we are deploying the missing technology links in value chains. Over 45 million tonnes of brewers spent grain is produced globally each year that is under-utilised, usually sent to landfill or to farmers as a stock feed. Brewing beer only removes the starchy sugars from the grain, yet the food-grade byproduct is all the fantastic protein, fibre and micronutrients that goes to waste. This makes no sense and creates a big opportunity that we at Grainstone are working to fix.
A new high-protein high-fibre staple for the health and sustainability conscious.
We uniquely rejuvenate premium wholegrain barley used in crafting Australia’s best beers to create a wholesome goodness-packed versatile specialty flour you’ll love. 
Give your cooking a sustainability and health kick!
This innovative ingredient is the tip of the iceberg of our vision.
Not just for food manufacturers; boost the health and sustainability of your food at home with Grainstone Premium Brewers Flour. We have developed a range of 
This specialty flour can be used as a supplement in a range of food products including biscuits, granola breakfast cereals, slices, muffins, healthy snack bars, artisan breads, extruded or puffed savoury snacks, sausage and pie filler, stews, soups and more.
We have developed a ground-breaking eco-friendly sequential fractionation extraction process for functional ingredients from grain byproducts. 
Our protein concentrate and soluble dietary fibre products from this process are of particularly high value to food manufacturers and create exciting new product opportunities.
Our modular integrated advanced biorefinery technology provides options for different market locations and deployment scenarios. 
Our kits can also utilise other feedstocks - including grain milling and pomace byproducts even whole grains.

Protein and dietary fibre boosted by Grainstone
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 Preheat oven to 150ºC. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well using a spoon. Let the mixture sit for 30 mins as this allows the chia seeds to absorb some of the moisture, making it a thick dough.
2 Spread the dough out on a pice of non-stick baking paper. Place a second piece on top of the first and flatten the dough in between, as thin as possible using a rolling pin. Getting the right thickness can be tricky as the chia seeds can be gooey.
3 When the dough is rolled thin, remove the top piece of paper carefully to avoid messing the thin dough. Cut the dough into small square using a knife or pizza cutter. If too gooey try baking for five minutes before cutting.
4 Place in oven and bake for 30-40 mins until golden brown and crisp. Let them cool for five mins before breaking them up into small squares.

Protein and dietary fibre boosted by Grainstone
2 x 7g packet dry yeast
1 Make a starter in a bowl with yeast, sugar and warm water. Let sit for 15 mins, or until activated.
2 With a wooden spoon mix in the flour and salt until a dough forms. Knead then make into a ball. Remove the dough and use 1 tbsp oil to coat the bowl then replace the dough. Cover the bowl with cling wrap and leave in a warm place for three hours, like a sunny window sill (ideally 28-32ºC and best not over 35ºC).
3 Knead again and let sit for one hour. Preheat a dutch oven to 220ºC.
4 Place the dough in the dutch oven, cover it. Bake for one hour, including removing the cover for the final 15 mins.
Serving suggestion - Slice and serve warm with balsamic vinegar and olive oil for dipping, plus a glass of red wine!
Tip: As a high fibre flour, unless you are a professional baker our product is best suited towards flatter breads

1 table spoon of golden syrup
1 Preheat fan forced oven to 180ºC. Melt butter, golden syrup and sugar in a medium saucepan on stove, then let cool for a few minutes.
2 Add beaten egg, mix well. Stir in flours, baking powder, coconut, vanilla, fruit, seed and milk.
3 Spread in a greased slice tin. Bake for 15mins until cooked and golden brown.
4 Cool in tin, then slice into square and enjoy.

2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
1 Preheat oven to 150ºC. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well using a spoon. Let the mixture sit for 30 mins as this allows the chia seeds to absorb some of the moisture, making it a thick dough.
2 Spread the dough out on a pice of non-stick baking paper. Place a second piece on top of the first and flatten the dough in between, as thin as possible using a rolling pin. Getting the right thickness can be tricky as the chia seeds can be gooey.
3 When the dough is rolled thin, remove the top piece of paper carefully to avoid messing the thin dough. Cut the dough into small square using a knife or pizza cutter. If too gooey try baking for five minutes before cutting.
4 Place in oven and bake for 30-40 mins until golden brown and crisp. Let them cool for five mins before breaking them up into small squares.
