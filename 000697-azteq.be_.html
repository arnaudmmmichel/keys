The sustainable solution for industries in need of high temperature thermal energy and reducing the ecological footprint at the same time
Industries in need of thermal energy
Industries can call on Azteq’s expertise when there is a need for high quality heat up to 400°C within the production process and you want to reduce the enormous CO2 emissions industries in an economically responsible manner.
Industries with available land space, roofs or other facilities such as car parks
The parabolic reflector installations on Azteq are normally installed on available land space, but can also be placed on reinforced roofs or tripods (e.g. above a parking lot) when available space is a problem. Although the ideal surface area depends on your energy needs, you can assume that a hectare of mirrors is capable of generating 5 megawatts of high quality heat.
Industries that pursue sustainability in an economically responsible way
Ambitions in green heat energy remain theoretical unless financially viable. Azteq’s business proposition gives industries access to competitive prices against traditional gas. Our business model unburdens the customer from his capex investments via a special purpose vehicle setup. The customer only pays for the consumed thermal energy of a ‘heat-as-a-service’ contract.
Until recently, the use of parabolic reflector systems to generate sustainable heat was only profitable in areas with very high DNI (direct normal irradiation or direct incoming sunlight) like warm countries and desert-like areas. However, thanks to technological innovations, it is now also possible in Northern Europe. The heat produced by the new generation parabolic reflector systems are competitive with gas prices upward of 1000 hours of sunshine per year. To make use of this, you will of course need a certain surface area to place these reflectors on. Exactly how large that surface area has to be depends on your heat consumption. Please contact us to request a calculation without obligation!
High quality heat above a railway
ADPO is a chemical logistics company based in the port of Antwerp and focuses on transshipment of chemical products. ADPO uses gas-fired steam at temperatures above 140 °C to keep the viscosity of the chemical products optimal. In addition, steam is used to clean transshipment tanks. The production of steam is accompanied by very high CO2 emissions. By deploying the Azteq CST platform, those emissions have decreased by more than 10%.
Proviron develops, produces and sells specialized chemicals. They use gas-fired industrial heat in the form of steam for their industrial processes. In order to reduce the associated CO2 emissions Proviron deployed the Azteq CST platform to reduce the use of gas by 10%.

Sustainable and efficient solutions, that is the strength of our expertise.
Sustainable sources of electricity generation are increasingly becoming the norm, just think of the many solar panels or windmills that are already shaping the landscape today. However, producing sustainable heat is not yet self-evident, even though our heat consumption is just responsible for two-thirds of total CO2 emissions.
Azteq's solar thermal installations offer a solution for this by using the power of parabolic reflectors. These make it possible to generate heat of up to 400 °C in a sustainable and financially feasible manner.
All the elements for an efficient system
Azteq solar mirrors capture and concentrate the sunbeams because of their geometry to the same point.
The collector tube is located in the focal point of the mirror and absorbs the heat which then is transported by means of thermal oil.
The heat exchanger transfers the heat from the oil to the medium that is applicable in the production process.
If you do not use the captured heat immediately, it can be stored in thermal energy storage (TES) for later use.
In addition to solar heat the industrial heat system will also use another alternative source to cover sunless days.
Our solar mirrors reflect more than ninety-five percent of the sunbeams collected to the same point. This high degree of reflection is made possible by a special coating that reflects the rays as much as possible and absorbs as little as possible. In addition, our mirrors move with the sun so that they make maximum use of the sunlight at any time of the day. To limit the impact on the environment as much as possible, the mirrors rotate to a vertical position when there is no direct sunlight so when it rains so that no water is collected.
The collector tube captures the heat and makes it mobile. For this purpose, the tube consists of three parts: a glass outer tube, a metal inner tube through which oil flows and a vacuum between the two parts. The inner tube uses an energy-absorbing coating in order to minimize the heat losses. The oil in it has a high thermal conductivity to absorb the heat as efficiently as possible. Because of the vacuum and the glass outer tube, the whole tube remains cold to the touch, and therefore bird friendly.
This is where the magic happens. The heat exchanger ensures that the captured heat can actually be used. The heat exchanger transfers the heat generated by hot oil from the heat collector to the medium used in the customer’s production process. This can again be thermal oil, but also heat in the form of steam or hot water.
The heat itself lends very well to storage for delayed use, up to five times more efficient than electricity. Azteq makes use of this property by installing buffer vessels that serve as a kind of battery. This allows you to use heat 24/7, even when the sun is not shining. This system requires an additional set of mirrors to produce heat for storage.
Despite having an average of 1300 hours of sunshine per year in Europe, there are of course days on which the solar mirrors cannot capture direct sunlight. As a result, they will not be able to generate the necessary heat. Azteq solar mirrors will therefore be installed in combination with an alternative heat source whenever continuous heat generation is required. This can be done with your current gas installation, but also with sustainable alternatives such as biogas. The heat exchanger will then be shared by both systems.
Higher temperatures than other sustainable options
Until now, it has often been impossible for industrial applications to switch entirely to sustainable heat. Technologies such as geothermal or solar flat plate boilers with a temperature range of up to 120 °C are unable to provide the necessary heat for a large part of the industrial processes. By optimizing the technique in which sunlight is concentrated, Azteq’s installations are able to produce heat of up to 400 °C. This is sufficient to support most of the production processes while not compromising on sustainability.
Azteq’s solar mirrors are the only sustainable source of high-quality heat that is completely CO2-neutral from installation onwards. Other alternatives to the ecological production of heat are also responsible for CO2 after the development and installation of the system due to combustion reactions. With Azteq solar mirrors, this is not the case and CO2 emissions are limited to the production and transport of the systems.
The impact of Azteq solar mirrors on the environment is almost non-existent. Thanks to vacuum technology, the collector tube exterior remains cold enough to touch. The installations are completely odorless, noiseless and move extremely slowly. The mirrors can be directed vertically in rainy weather, so that all the ground receives the rain.

Project Thermal Equalizer for Industrial Heat grids
Azteq’s team has always been looking for ways to enhance the performance and efficiency of our CST platforms in order to keep challenging ourselves and the world that sustainable industrial heat is the playing a major factor in the future of CO2-reduction. In order for our CST platforms to become even more sustainable, we have started project: ”Thermal Equalizer for industrial heat grids”. This is a European subsidized project that we develop together with our Dutch partner Meeberg ISO Tanks & Containers.
Meeberg is specialized in the development of tailor-made ISO tanks which are capable of holding various liquids ranging from hydrogen peroxide to solvents and oils. They have the largest available stock of used ISO tank containers in Europe which provide a plethora of high quality services to different companies all over the world. With Meeberg’s extensive knowledge and experience of the design of these ISO tanks and their modifications, they are more than suitable to bring this European subsidized project around.
By combining our expertise and experience, we aim to create a modular heat storage tank that will balance out a constant output of industrial heat suitable for tailor-made needs of industrial processes. This will boost the efficiency of CO2-reduction provided by Azteq’s CST platforms by making the entire platform smarter and make sustainable heat storage possible across industrial heat grids.
This project is supported and financed by Interreg.
