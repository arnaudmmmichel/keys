If there is a wet surface, there is a biofilm.  This can be on ship hulls, tubes of heat exchangers, in pipelines, drinking lines, tanks, jacuzzi ,…
Biofilm is the cause of many fouling problems. Trapped within the biofilm are micro-organisms which are resistant to standard disinfection processes,  because the biofilm actually protects the micro-organisms from being destroyed.
attachment of barnacles, mussels, oysters and algae
buildup of scale , rust, chalck
Conventional methods of microbial control have proven inadequate, so the best way to combat biofilm is preventative. Don’t let the biofilm get started. That is exactly what Harsonic® does.
By using ultrasound combined with our proprietary HS technology, the formation of biofilm is prevented in ecological friendly manner.
All sound is caused by vibrations; they set up waves which travel through a medium. That medium can be air, but sound actually travels better through fluids and solids. The human ear can detect sound at frequencies of between 20 and 20,000 Hertz, this being the number of vibrations per second. Sound at a frequency above 20 KHz is inaudible to humans and is known as ‘ultrasound’.
The transducer is th­e main part of the ultrasound machine. The transducer  makes the sound waves and receives the echoes. It is, so to speak, the mouth and ears of the ultrasound machine. The transducer  generates and receives sound waves using a principle called the piezoelectric (pressure electricity) effect. In the transducer, there are one or more quartz crystals called piezoelectric crystals.  When an electric current is applied to these crystals, they change shape rapidly. The rapid shape changes, or vibrations, of the crystals produce sound waves that travel outward. Conversely, when sound or pressure waves hit the crystals, they emit electrical currents. Therefore, the same crystals can be used to send and receive sound waves.
The frequency of emitted sound waves determines how deep the sound waves penetrate.
Every organism has a certain frequency of its own. Water borne micro-organisms and bacteria attach and multiply creating bio-film layer ‘slime’. Algae cells also attach in the same way.  The bio-film provides a suitable surface to attach on.
Thanks to Harsonic® , there will no longer be a bio-film.  As a result growth is prevented as the cell structures of the algae and micro-organisms are targeted and cannot survive.
Ultrasound is completely harmless. Because it does not use radiation, the side effects of radiation are not an issue. Ultrasound is used every day for monitoring pregnant women and their unborn children.

Three different solutions to avoid biofilm growth on recreational boats
against growth on Propellers or Outdrive
against fouling in Fuel- or Watertanks
Highly effective against fouling (algae, grasses, barnacles,mussels)
Avoids biofilm in fuel- & watertanks (also dieselbacteria)
The lowest power consumption (6W) with the biggest range (40m2 / transducer !)
A clean hull is extremely important! Everybody who has a boat knows the problem: fouling or the growth of all kinds of organisms. Fouling is an annoying problem which reduces speed, increases fuel consumption and causes corrosion damage.
The current solutions are often not effective and require costly annual maintenance. Moreover, they harm the environment and your own health since they contain toxic elements.
Harsonic® avoids the initial step of the fouling, called biofilm. Eliminating the biofilm prevents the development and the attachment of barnacles, mussels, oysters and algae.
Harsonic® keeps the hull of your boat clean without taking the boat out of the water every year for cleaning and repainting.
Fouling can negatively affect your boat’s fuel efficiency, speed and cause increased maintenance costs to remove the fouling. It causes a powerboat to use up to 30% fuel and slows down sailboats because of the increased drag.
It can also affect the maneuverability of the boat. And if you leave fouling attached to your boat for too long you can damage the paint and cause deterioration of your boat overall. Hull fouling is highest for boats that remain stationary in the water for long periods of time.
A propeller in poor state is a disaster
A propeller and his shaft is exposed to all sorts of attacks underwater, such as rusting and adhesions of the sea. It is the key piece of the ship’s propulsion system, and thus deserves special attention.
To continue to use a very dirty propeller is like driving your car on a road that’s in very poor state and full of potholes. We know that very dirty pieces of equipment notably reduce the displacement of the ship. And the same thing happens with the propeller because, although its surface is a lot smaller than that of the ship’s wet hull, its surface area is multiplied by its many revolutions at high speed.
The objective is that it should always be clean of horrible incrustations and calcareous deposits.
Clean fuel tanks are crucial to avoid diesel engine failures
You might have noticed it before :
slimy and dirty or even clogged fuel filters
These symptoms are caused by dirty fuel tanks.
Due to the natural process of fuel degradation (micro-organisms, bacteria and enzyme activity, fungus, yeast and mold) over time, a sludge of waste products accumulates in your fuel tank.
This sludge will form a coating or bio-film on the walls of your fuel tank and clog your filter.
Some people use biocides or chemical products but this makes the situation even worse ! Some of these products even develop bio-film throughout the entire diesel fuel system which causes dramatic filter plugging. Moreover the application of these products are a never ending story and cost a lot of money.
The only good solution is a Harsonic® device which prevents problems and clean the tank completely of bio-film. Harsonic® prevents the built up of the very first step of fouling, which is bio-film.
The only effective device which can avoid biofilm is Harsonic®.
Prevent built up from the very first step.

Five different solutions to avoid biofilm growth on ships and offshore
Highly effective against fouling (algae, grasses, barnacles,mussels)
Avoids biofilm in fuel- & watertanks (also dieselbacteria)
The lowest power consumption (6W) with the biggest range (50m2 / transducer !)
Lots of cooling is required on a seagoing vessel.
Traditionally this is done by bringing in seawater through the sea chest.
Boxcoolers, being continuously exposed to this seawater, are always potential fouling victims. Barnacles, mussels, algae, and other types of shellfish grow on the tubes of the boxcooler and thus affect its heat transfer function.
Classical methods, as using chemicals, to avoid scale or even sea growth are not possible to use in this case, as the chemicals would be needed to put direct in the seawater, what will never work due to the amount of seawater and as well due to the regulations and other authorities.
After a chemical or heated treatment, the bio-film will grow immediately back. So the procedure today is as soon the cooling is not sufficient anymore, the box cooler has to be removed, cleaned and brought back in operation . Of course during the cleaning the vessel can’t be in operation, so this cleaning is very expensive for the ship owners and fouling can start again.
The well known cathodic protections, are expensive and don’t always offer the required no growth warranty. Then the vessel still needs to go in dry dock for cleaning or repairs due to fouling.
Harsonic for Boxcoolers protects the boxcooler 24/7 on low voltage, the sea-chest and the cooling tubes remain free of growth and biofilm.

Four different solutions to avoid on cooling towers, pipelines, tanks and heat exchangers
Highly effective against fouling (algae, grasses, barnacles,mussels)
Avoids biofilm in fuel- & watertanks (also dieselbacteria)
The lowest power consumption (6W) with the biggest range (40m2 / transducer !)
Water that is circulated even in tap water, often contains salts (such as chlorine, sulphates and carbonates), dissolved gases (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) and metal ions (such as iron and manganese ions). The presence of these pollutants can cause a series of problems. The main problems that are caused are fouling, limestone formation, corrosion and biological growth.
Bacteria and other pathogenic mircro-organisms are present everywhere in the environment. They can often be found in cooling tower water. When cooling towers contain an open recirculation system, micro-organisms can spread from air to water. Micro-organisms can rapidly multiply when a substrate is present and a number of conditions are ideal for microbial growth. Examples of these factors are pH, temperature, oxygen concentration and nutrients. The nutrient content in water increases because of water evaporation. Process leaks and water use can also cause the nutrient content in the water to increase. Higher nutrient content can cause problems.
When significant microbial growth takes place, a slime layer is formed. This slime layer contains both organic and inorganic matter. Some micro-organisms excrete polymers, which can form a gel-like network around cells after hydrolysis takes place. This is called a biofilm. As a result of biofilm formation, microorganisms can attach themselves to surface layers. This biofilm layer allows micro-organisms to no longer be flushed away . Biofilms protect micro-organisms from toxic disinfectants. Water disinfection will be much more difficult when a biofilm is present.
Biofilm partly consists of microbiological cells and other components. Biofilm, which is very sticky, also contains organic and inorganic matter that is present in the water and is absorbed by the film. This matter contains chemical precipitation, organic flakes and dead cell mass.
The only effective device which can avoid biofilm is Harsonic®.
Prevent built up from the very first step.
