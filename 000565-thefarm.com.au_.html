The Farm is principally a working farm, we house a collection of micro-businesses all sharing in a common goal. We invite you to come and visit us and see for yourself how a farm operates, supports the environment and contributes to a healthier lifestyle.
 inspires all that we do, here and for the community at large. We believe that it is first hand experience of seeing how food is grown and produced that makes the eating of it so much more pleasurable. From this simple pleasure sprouts a curiosity and desire to learn more.
We hope you enjoy your visit to The Farm and leave feeling inspired to make even the smallest change towards a healthier, more harmonious existence with our land, our animals and our communities.
Our 80 acre working farm is home to a community of growers, producers, eateries, and educators who share a passion for growing food using traditional, sustainable methods that are 100% spray and chemical free. Together, we are working towards improving the health and wellness of our community, from the ground up.
The Farm’s fields are home to heritage-breed pigs, heritage Scottish Highland cattle and chickens, all of which roam freely and are used for meat and eggs in the on-site restaurant, cafe and produce store. A short stroll will see you stumble across fields of flowers and row upon row of lush greens and vegetables, also used and sold on-site.
The Farm’s buildings service a dynamic hub of like-minded micro businesses: Three Blue Ducks Restaurant and Produce Store, The Bread Social, Baylato and The Garden Shed. We also offer onsite workshops for adults and children in our spectacular spaces, which are also great for private events.
With environmental sustainability and nurturing the land top of mind, we decided it was only right to extend this to cover social and economic sustainability too. Since opening our doors, we have developed a number of ongoing projects ensuring the business is forever giving back to the local community. For more information on these projects visit the 
Our philosophy is built on our motto ‘Grow, Feed, Educate’.
 your food, your people and your community.
 and nourish your physical self, your soul and the land on which you live.
 yourself, your family and your community so that we can all actively participate as sustainable food growers, producers and consumers.
Our intention was to build a farm for ‘the people’.
We invite you to wander around, take in your surroundings and reflect on the concept of wellness – wellness of the land, the body, the mind and the community.
We encourage you to explore the property and its various food and flower plots, meet the animals, talk to our farmers and get inspired by watching a working farm in progress.
Our mission is to play a crucial role in improving health and wellness from the ground up.
This encompasses the condition of our land, what we grow in it, the foods we consume from it and ultimately what we then become from achieving our goals. In the process, we will create a ripple effect which can transform the wellness of ourselves and the greater community.
The following are the values of The Farm which are reflected in all we do and in every intention we have. It is also a framework to make decisions based on developments at The Farm and people we employ through to customers we serve:

Animals — The Farm Byron Bay
            The Produce Store - Local Produce
The Produce Store - Local Produce
The Farm is home to three types of livestock – Poultry, Pigs and Beef Cattle. They serve to supply the restaurant and produce store under our ‘farm to table’ model, as well as help to maintain and improve the health of our soil. Healthy soil means healthy plants, which in turn means better quality produce. Our animals are free to roam as much as possible, fed a natural, varied diet and treated with compassion and respect by our farmers. We welcome you to watch our animals, but please do not touch.
Our drift of English Large Black pigs reside in paddocks where they are free to run around, root and dig up the grass and wallow in mud baths. Their diet consists of different grasses and legumes, mixed grains, vegetable scraps, cracked eggs and buttermilk. They keep everyone entertained through their complex vocabulary of oinks, grunts and squeals. Our aim is to provide the restaurant with 2 pigs each week, one suitable for a spit and a larger one for pork cuts.
The Farm’s herd of beef cattle consist of Scottish Highlanders and are 100% grass fed and finished. We are in the process of putting the appropriate infrastructure in place so that we can cell graze and rotate them around the property. This is the most ethical, healthy and sustainable method of raising cattle as it allows them to regularly graze on fresh pasture, which enriches the soil, sequesters carbon, increase soil fertility and regenerates new growth.
First there was Braveheart and not long after that came Bobby. Braveheart the Scottish Highland was hand raised by The Farm team after being abandoned by his Mother and rejected by the herd. Bobby the Rooster  is slowly becoming the king of The Farm. His unique silky feather’s and ability to razzle dazzle anyone that comes his way has given him a confidence like no other. Bobby loves to celebrate and hang out with staff. Whether it’s a wedding, lunch or Christmas party Bobby will be there entertaining all.

To continue to support our partnership with Northern Rivers Community Foundation (NRCF), The Farm proudly unveiled the NRCF Wishing Well, an exciting community project that donates 100% of proceeds to NRCF.
NRCF is an independent philanthropic foundation dedicated to improving the lives of those in our northern rivers communities who are in most need of support. With approximately 500,000 visitors a year we hope to raise a substantial amount for a number of charities throughout our community.
To kick off the launch that took place in 2016 Tom and Emma, owners of The Farm presented John Callanan from the NRCF with a $5000 donation.
The wishing well is onsite at The Farm and we encourage people to donate and make a wish when they visit.
In September 2016 we partnered up with the Liberation Larder – a local organisation that supply approximately 550 meals a week – breakfast, lunch and takeaway containers. These meals are spread throughout the local community across Brunswick Heads, Mullimbimby and Byron Bay areas.
The Farm donated Liberation Larder a quarter of an acre vegetable plot (part of our Market Garden) to use to grow vegetables. Since then, the project has turned into a social enterprise with a number of local organisations jumping on board. The S.H.I.F.T Project Inc. now man the plot and the Byron Bay Herb Nursery donate the seedlings and help with harvesting!
We are very excited to have all three companies work together to help Grow, Feed and Educate the local community.
For more information on these local organisations or if you would like to volunteer to help out please visit their websites:
In June 2016 we were lucky enough to have The Green Army join forces with our team here at The Farm. The Green Army is a government run practical environmental action programme that supports local unemployed youth by giving them hands on experience in conservation and farming. The programme aims to give youth the skills to better their chances at future employment. Our skilled staff and horticulturalist were able to provide onsite training and mentorship to The Green Army.
Over a three-month period, they planted and maintained over 4500 trees and bushes, installed electric fences, planted over 500 vegetable seedlings, conducted bird surveys and learnt about water quality testing and more.
We were extremely impressed by the hard work put in by the team!
We were delighted to assist with the launch of Fergus and Delilah, the children’s picture book that will change the way children view disabilities. Local author Erin Knutt and illustrator Misa Alexandra launched the book here at The Farm in November 2016.
We see this book as a crucial step towards achieving an inclusive community where every child has the opportunity to thrive. With this in mind, the decision to support the children’s book was simple.
Here at The Farm we are dedicated to creating an environment that nourishes our community. Fergus & Delilah encompasses our focus on inclusion and we love being a place for the younger generation to come together, learn and enjoy the pure surroundings.

Three Blue Ducks run the restaurant, cafe and produce store at The Farm Byron Bay. ‘The Ducks’, as we are fondly known, are five mates who are passionate about nourishing the community with ethical, authentic, quality food and hospitality.
We endeavour to source as much as possible from The Farm and then we venture further afield. We embrace produce that is organic or spray free and sustainably farmed to make all the meals on our menu. We get almost everything from the local area when it is in season, from southern Queensland to as far down as Port Macquarie. Our dishes are a reflection of our shared ethos for creating honest, seasonal dishes that are packed with nutrients and full of flavour. We call it ‘real food’.
Our space is purposefully designed to be low-key but comfortable. The undercover outdoor patio offers sweeping views from Byron’s hinterland in the west, north to Mt Warning and east to Cape Byron Lighthouse. The terrace is home to our very own 12 metre outdoor kitchen, including a double spit, a wood fire pizza oven and an Argentinian grill that we love to fire up on weekends and for private events. Our bar offers 56 taps of all Australian craft beers, wines and ciders and a selection of unique cocktails to cater to all tastes.
