The systems and cultures we draw facts from, proof from, wisdom from, are old, established and proven. Ayurvedic, Chinese, African, Indigenous medical systems have all helped to shape our foundations and our products.
And then of course, there’s family. That’s exactly what we are. We are a small family based in Melbourne who are all passionate about health and love more than anything, sharing a meal around the dinner table. And that’s where it all starts, with family. That’s where Golden Grind was born and that’s our why. The joy of seeing our business grow and succeed has been so much sweeter because it was all us, family. It’s pure passion and our goal has always been to help people live their lives fully. To make people healthier, and happier. To improve the longevity, not only of our family, but of yours as well.
Why we do what we do.
We wanted to create natural medicines that are personalised and that fit easily into busy lives. Products that positively impact the quality and longevity of our lives. We’ve been doing just that for over 5 years now.  
The positive feedback we’ve received over the years is one of the reasons we are so committed to this. We know what works. We are constantly evolving, as individuals and as business owners, to make sure we’re always offering you the very best we can.
Nothing is done, no decision is made, without hours and hours of scientific research being completed. We have some of the country’s best working alongside us in doing that. 
But it’s not all about science. What we do has to be sustainable, it has to be for the greater good. We are preparing the world for the generations to come and Golden Grind wants to be a part of the positive impact we can make. 
We have evolved and we are so excited to share our new products with you. We’ve been working on this for years and we know you're going to love it! 
We're reimagining the relationship you have with your health. 
We heal, prevent and cure. Naturally.

We want to start by acknowledging the traditional owners of the land in which we’re on, and pay our respects to their elders past, present and emerging. Our manufacturing, processing, making, and workings all happen in Australia, on Indigenous land. We are utterly respectful and so grateful for this earth we get to live on. 
As a close family, the team behind Golden Grind share a holistic approach to life and a serious passion to create natural products that actually work. No marketing BS. Just good, honest products.
Every ingredient used has a purpose. There's no fillers, no preservatives, no chemicals. Using a range of herbs, botanical, spices and plants that have all stand the test of time; thousands of years and the brutality of credible scientific testing.
We strongly believe in the healing practices of ancient Ayurvedic, Chinese, Indigenous and African medicine systems. We have spent years learning about and researching these practices, and the remedies that have been proven to work over thousands of years. We truly believe this way of healing our bodies is fundamental to longevity. 
We couple this through investing time and energy on ensuring the best scientists, developers and manufacturers in Australia have hand crafted each and every product.
We acknowledge we are the lucky ones. Rooves over our heads, food on our tables. We are acutely aware that there are those less fortunate than us, and so we ensure that a percentage of all revenue earned is spent on helping those who need it most. We work closely with charities and groups that are close to our hearts.

They operate Australia’s largest charity kitchens, cooking more than 10,000 meals a day between their Melbourne and Brisbane kitchens. FareShare’s complete meals improve the diet and wellbeing of some of the most vulnerable people in Australia, including women and children fleeing domestic violence, low income families and people of all ages experiencing homelessness.

Over the past few years, Golden Grind has consulted medical experts across traditional medicinal systems to craft our formulations. We have worked alongside traditional Ayurveda, Chinese, and Indigenous cultures. Below is a list of the key ingredients we use and why. 
In all situations, Golden Grind sources the very best, highest quality ingredients from around the world that are commonly of organic and sustainable origin. 
(as it is part of the Ginger family) is a beautiful bright yellow spice most commonly grown in parts of Asia. With a rich history stemming from both Ayurveda and Chinese medicines, turmeric has long been celebrated (for as many as 5000 years) for its bountiful health benefits and traditional medicinal properties. It is proven that turmeric can aid digestion, help support healthy liver function, act as a strong antioxidant, stimulate contractions of the gallbladder, help aid the symptomatic relief of dysmenorrhea (TCM) and help relieve mild rheumatic joint pain (Ayuervedic). Furthermore, studies have shown promising results in aiding the management of ailments such as chronic inflammation, cancer prevention, treatment of depression, immune regulation, pain relief, skin disease, bone disease and various others creating a focus point for research to come. We use the whole turmeric in preference to curcumin extract as the scientific research would suggest all of the properties within the root have a significant role to play. 
Marshmallow root (Althaea officinalis) is a perennial herb that's native to Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa. It's been used as a indigenous cultures for thousands of years to treat digestive, respiratory, and skin conditions. It contains a mucilage that is what gives it healing powers by forming a protective layer on the skin and lining of the digestive tract. It also contains chemicals that might decrease cough and help heal wounds by decreasing inflammation and fighting certain microbes. 
Astragalus has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine for health purposes. It has been promoted as a dietary supplement for many conditions, including the common cold, upper respiratory infections, hay fever, asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome, and chronic kidney disease, among others. It’s also promoted to strengthen and regulate the immune system.
Elderflower is the flower of a tree and is commonly used to make medicine. The elderflower has antibacterial and antiviral properties, that work to boost the immune system. The most common use of the elderflower is to treat everyday cold and flu symptoms like swollen sinuses and sore throat. It is also used as a diuretic or to increase sweating to help with detoxification. 
Valerian is an native European herb that is commonly used to make medicine. Valerian is most commonly used for sleep disorders, especially the inability to sleep (insomnia). Valerian is most effective when taken alongside hops and lemon balm. 
Hops are the flowers of the hop plant Humulus lupulus, a member of the Cannabaceae family of flowering plants. Hops seem to have effects similar to the hormone oestrogen that may be the reason why it is helpful in getting people to sleep and combating insomnia. And while hops have shown promise for relieving anxiety and sleep disorders on their own, they might be even more effective when combined with an herb called valerian. This herb has a lot in common with hops. It also has a long history of use as an herbal treatment for insomnia. 
Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis) is a lemon-scented herb that comes from the same family as mint. The herb is native to Europe, North Africa, and West Asia, but it's grown around the world. Lemon balm has traditionally been used to improve mood and cognitive function, but the potential benefits don't stop there. A study revealed that taking lemon balm twice daily for 15 days improves sleep in people with insomnia. Taking lemon balm in combination with other ingredients also seems to improve sleep quality in people with sleeping disorders.
Passiflora incarnata, commonly known as maypop, purple passionflower, true passionflower, wild apricot, and wild passion vine, is a fast-growing perennial vine with climbing or trailing stems. Early studies suggest it might help relieve insomnia and anxiety and that this plant possesses adequate properties to be considered as sleep inducer. 
Ashwagandha, botanically known as Withania somnifera Dunal, is a member of the Solanaceae family. It is commonly known as Indian Ginseng or Winter Cherry, is also referred to as the ‘King of herbs’. Some studies have shown positive effects on reducing stress and anxiety levels and is commonly referred to as an Adaptogen. It also provides numerous other benefits for your body and brain. 
Bacopa monnieri, also called brahmi, water hyssop, thyme-leaved gratiola, and herb of grace, is a staple plant in traditional Ayurvedic medicine. Several studies have found that Bacopa Monnieri can speed up information processing in your brain, reduce reaction times and improve memory.  
Ginkgo biloba, or maidenhair, is a tree native to China that has been grown for thousands of years for a variety of uses. Ginkgo Biloba supplements have been shown to improve memory and mental processing in healthy older adults when taken daily for six weeks. 
Siberian Ginseng Root has been shown to reduce brain fatigue and significantly improve performance on difficult tasks like mental math problems. 
Eastern medicine has celebrated mushrooms as medicine for thousands of years. Golden Grind’s products contains a range of organically grown mushrooms.  Mushrooms are a rare vegetarian source of Vitamin B-12, vitamin D2 and linoleic acid (omega 6 fatty acid). These minerals and vitamins can help with a wide range of bodily functions from cardiovascular health, energy levels, immunity, hormones, gut health and the nervous system and contain Vitamin B’s and Vitamin D. The mushrooms specifically that we use in our products include Chaga, Cordyceps, Lion's Mane and Reishi. They are all organically and wildly grown. 
The green banana powder in our products is a 100% natural, made from nutritious green lady finger bananas grown on the Atherton Tablelands in tropical Far North Queensland.
Green Banana Powder is a great prebiotic and the world's highest quality, resistant starch. Prebiotics feed probiotics (good gut bacteria) and therefore help to keep the digestive tract healthy and happy. A healthy gut ensures nutrients are properly absorbed and allows the superfoods in this blend to work efficiently. Our gut also communicates directly with our brain and so can help to have an immediate impact on ailments and symptoms. 
Hemp seed protein is a great, vegan protein source that is high in fibre. Proteins are made up of chemical 'building blocks' called amino acids. Your body uses amino acids to build and repair muscles and bones and to make hormones and enzymes. They can also be used as an energy source. Hemp seeds have unique fatty-acids including the perfect balance ofomega-3 and -6 fatty acids, plus less common, but important acids like stearidonic and gamma linoleic acids. These fatty acids have shown to fight inflammation throughout the body as well as helping to protect your blood and heart and immune system. Don't worry about feeling any psychotropic side effects, hemp seeds don't actually contain THC, the active drug found in hemp leaf.
Our hemp seed protein is grown organically in Australia.

Golden Grind undergoes a lengthy and extensive process when formulating each and every product. 
We start by consulting specialists and practitioners who are esteemed in their field of work. When have multiple speciality scientists across Australia blend/make/draft the conceptual products before a testing lab will sign off on the final formulations. We then, perhaps most important process, send draft products to a selected focus group to gather specific product feedback and results. Once we are happy with the efficacy of the product, we spend an abundance of hours researching where we can find the highest quality and most sustainable ingredients and begin sourcing. 
Our products work, formulations are unique, our ingredients are the best and our team is to thank.
