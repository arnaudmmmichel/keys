meta description:Transform communities and empower people using the most reliable and sustainable electricity source: hydro power!

through the power of running water
To emPOWER 1 million Kenyans by 2027
We provide affordable, reliable and sustainable power in regions that do not have this today to enable progress and prosperity.
We do this by using small run-of-river hydropower plants, that have minimal impact on the environment and generate maximum power output.
To date, 759 million people do not have access to electricity globally and 3 out 4 of these people live in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Just take a moment to picture your day-to-day life without electricity. From the lights you switch on in the morning, the hot shower you take, the fridge keeping your food fresh, the computer you use to work, to the mobile phone that keeps you connected to the rest of the world. It is hard to picture, isn’t it?
Small hydropower is the most efficient, affordable & sustainable source of energy.
We combine proven technology with a smart business model.
Stronger together is our core belief;
We use ever flowing rivers which makes our power the most reliable and affordable
We offer a total solution: product manufacturing + project development + operation and maintenance
ustomers to spread our risks and to ensure that all power is consumed
We are deeply embedded in the local community and create extra impact through customized services & local partnerships

meta title:About Us - Hydrobox
meta description:N/A

John grew up in a small village in Murang’a, Kenya, about 3 hours drive from the capital Nairobi. Growing up, no one in his community had electricity. The nearest electricity pole was 15 km away. After seeing his mother struggle, he decided to build his first micro hydro power plant using everyday objects providing affordable electricity to over 300 households.
In another part of the world, Thomas had been working on a way to use local rivers to electrify rural areas in Africa.
Thomas began his career at Deloitte where he developed a service line, supporting international organizations manage their operations in Africa. In 2014, he started working as an independent consultant and project developer in recycling and renewable energy projects. His clients include the World Bank, the Belgian government, the French development cooperation and the Port of Antwerp. In 2015 he co-founded NAMé Recycling, a plastic recycling company operating 3 factories in Cameroon having recycled 30 million bottles to date.
They met, and with John’s technical knowledge and Thomas’ business acumen, they scaled up and professionalized the technology which is now known as the Hydrobox.

meta description:Hydrobox develops and operates environmentally friendly hydro power plants developed to transform communities and empower individuals %

Hydroelectricity is a proven technology but operating it in Africa comes with a few challenges. That is how we came up with the Hydrobox.
Technology alone does not change the world. It needs a strong business model to be scalable and sustainable.
To overcome electricity barriers, we believe in providing a total solution. That is why we offer Hydrobox energy as a service and Hydrobox as a serviced product.
Many players in the rural electrification industry struggle because electricity consumption by rural households is lower than they expected.
Unlike with solar or wind energy, our rivers produce electricity 24 hours a day. We leverage this advantage by serving 3 complementary market segments through our innovative ABC+ model.
The mixing of customers results in a high off-take percentage and translates into lower prices compared to when focusing exclusively on 1 segment.
As a result, our power is reliable, affordable and sustainable.
To increase the impact of our power, we partner with likeminded organisations to offer electricity related services that touch & improve our customer’s lives further.
We do this because we believe we are stronger together. It also helps us reach our goal of 100% offtake.

Mwangaza in collaboration with Vlaams Brabant
Although 70% of Kenyans have access to electricity, growth has stagnated in recent years. Additionally, electrification rates do not necessarily indicate the reliability, affordability, and sustainability of electricity. In reality, many Kenyans, especially those in rural areas, still lack access to quality electricity. This results in a persistent dependence on fossil fuels, low electricity usage, and consequently limited opportunities for economic progress.
Access to quality electricity is also a challenge in Baricho, a village near Mount Kenya. Economic growth is limited here too, as people are reluctant to invest in electrical equipment due to uncertainty over the electricity supply.
With the construction of the Mwangaza hydropower plant, HydroBox brings light to the community of Baricho. HydroBox not only supplies electricity, but also contributes to sustainable transportation by using e-bikes and providing a budget for businesses to increase their productivity by investing in electric devices.
HydroBox received a grant of 100,000 euros from the province of Vlaams Brabant for the project “Transforming Kenyan rural areas through reliable, sustainable, and affordable electricity.” The project will run until the end of 2023.
The project will have the following impact
Provide reliable and sustainable access to electricity to 150 households, 6 schools (4000 students), 2 health care centres, and 20-30 small and medium sized businesses
Stimulate electric mobility by piloting with 4 e-bikes
Reduce 250 tonnes of CO2 per year
