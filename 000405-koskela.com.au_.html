All of our furniture is Australian-made, which keeps our import and export emissions close to zero. We work with sustainable materials and ethical suppliers. And we have repair and maintenance initiatives in place to ensure our products last for as long physically possible. And when they reach the end of life? We turn them into new products. 
We don’t rely on carbon offsets or ‘clever’ carbon accounting to fuel our sustainability ambitions. Just hard work, clear goals, and good people.  
Speaking of goals, ours is to eliminate waste and be fully circular by 2027. How’s that for clever?

Polystyrene, commonly used in bean bag filler, is not typically accepted for recycling due to its lightweight nature and low scrap value. However, some local councils and waste management companies may accept polystyrene for recycling if it is clean and dry. Additionally, there are a few companies that specialise in the collection of polystyrene packaging materials which can recycle them into new products such as picture frames or garden beds.
An eco-friendly alternative to polystyrene is plant-based Eco Beans which are made from sustainable plants like buckwheat hulls or kapok fiber. Unlike polystyrene, Eco Beans are biodegradable and compostable making them a more sustainable option when it comes to filling your bean bags
Eco beans for beanbags in Australia
Introducing ENVEE, an innovative brand of eco-friendly and Australian-made bean bags filled with plant-based eco beans. These sustainable bean bags are perfect for any home or office, as they are designed to be environmentally responsible and stylish. The eco beans used to fill the bean bags are made from 100% plant-based materials, making them completely biodegradable and free of any harsh chemicals. The unique shape and design of the eco beans also provide superior comfort, support, and overall durability compared to conventional foam filling.
ENVEE’s bean bags are manufactured right here in Australia with a commitment to sustainability throughout the entire production process. All raw materials used to make their products are sourced from local suppliers
