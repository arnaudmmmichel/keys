Charlie Chair Ultra Pink | Limited Edition
Charlie Chair Ultra Pink | Limited Edition
This Limited Edition is made with recycled toys from the Belgian label, Quut. A joyful combination of speckles in different shades of pink, that will brighten any indoor or outdoor space.
With its ergonomic shapes, rounded edges and a large seating surface, Charlie is comfortable and safe for the little ones. Thanks to its well thought-out design, it is both light and remarkably stable. Thus, on the one hand, kids can move it around as they wish; on the other hand, it doesn't tip over easily. Charlie’s smooth silky surface is pleasant to the touch and easy to clean.
