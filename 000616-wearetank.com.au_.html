meta title:Purpose - TANK
meta description:N/A

We bring empathy and meaning to impact organisations.
Our vision is a world where every organisation realises their potential to do good, be ethical and purposeful.
At the core of our purpose is the belief in meaningful work.
Meaningful work moves us towards solving some of the world's most complex challenges — the advancement and empowerment of women, financial literacy for those who need it most, housing, health and wellbeing for all, gender equality, meaningful education for young people and developing platforms for the quieter voices in our communities.
Organisations, institutions and business can be forces for good and we're on a mission to work with purpose-driven leaders to help them answer their most important questions.
We are held to the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability through our B Corporation accreditation.
View our B Corporation Impact Score
As a team that works directly with leadership, we realise the influence we have on guiding boards, executives and organisational culture in becoming forces for good.
Accrediting as a B Corporation provides us the framework to ask better questions of ourselves, our work and how we can impact the world we live in, for the better.
We understand that partnering with impact organisations to solve complex organisational challenges requires a felixble, nimble and impact-minded team with a unique set of skills and diversity of thinking.
Our teams understand what it means to balance purpose with business outcomes in a meaningful way.
All leaders in their own right, our people are both accountable and responsible. With a wealth of business, entrepreneurship, impact and consultancy experience, they are mindful, authentic and understanding.
We build diverse, inclusive and insightful teams which include our consultants, members of your team, partners and the community impacted by the challenges we are seeking to solve. 
Non-conforming and dispersed, our team is autonomous and lead by impact experts in each given field we are engaged in. Our 'work-from-anywhere' culture mobilises quickly and brings a smart, efficient working relationship to each client engagement.
We are a values-led organisation which means our belief system influences our decision-making, behaviours, our relationships and partnerships.
We work to ensure the equitable representation and inclusion of age, gender, social, cultural and ethnic diversity in the organisatons we work with, the engagements and outcomes we are responsible for.
The equitable representation of cultural identity, respect and acknowledgement for First Nations peoples and our effort to centre the people who truly matter is present and prevalent in all of our engagements and interactions.
This requires a courage from us and the organisations we work with to create spaces where individuals can speak up and be heard, even in the face of adversity and challenge the upheaval of change and transformation.
We strive to give voice, access and opportunity to amplify voices that are mostly unheard and under-represented.; creating space for lived experience around the decision-making table and leading through deep-listening and actively advocating for equitable representation and diverse thinking in all aspects of our engagements, consultations and outcomes.
Empowering women, girls and their families.
Largely under-represented and under-served; empowering women, girls and their families are an area of impact and a core part of our belief system. When we provide space for their voices to be heard, for their perspectives to shape transformational outcomes, we create a world where they can flourish.
We believe change occurs when allyship moves from a plan into action, actively seeking perspectives different to our own, we seek to learn and act on this learning to empower those communities and people whose voices need to be heard.
Systems change and transformation won't occur by doing what we've always done. Challenging accepted norms is difficult, and sometimes dangerous, but when done ethically and empathically, it is a way to forge a path towards a more meaningful future.

In Australia, we are ready to lead the global transition to renewable energy.
We have the expertise, the technology and the capability. But we can’t do this alone.
At AusIREC24 we are bringing together global decision-makers alongside First Nation leaders to connect and drive action — because now is the time for our communities to shape a renewable story together.
A story where sustainable development leads the conversation.
A story where the future of our regions and people are prioritised — and technology advancement is utilised.
Together, we'll move forward to dream bigger. Learning from each other, and to leading together.
The Australian International Renewable Energy Conference 2024 — a once in a lifetime opportunity to bring impact leaders, decision-makers and industry professionals from around the world together to engage in a constructive dialogue about a sustainable future — and Australia's transformation towards renewable energy.
Working with The Clean Energy Council, and key stakeholders from the South Australian government, the Department of Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water, and Paris-based REN21, we developed the creative strategy, positioning, brand identity, voice and guidelines for this event.
In partnership with Indigenous Artist Kevin Wilson, we were able to bring a vast range of stakeholders together around a common vision for a design system that spoke to a global audience, as well as one that honoured the centuries-old knowledge of Australia's Indigenous peoples.
