Commute for an hour and a half or work in a different industry? The choice facing residents on city fringes
										In an ABC News interview, Dr Marcus Spiller discusses the future of Melbourne's outer suburbs. Highlighting that these suburbs are projected to see an influx of 1 million residents by 2056. This projection takes into account various changes in living preferences and urban development strategies, signaling the need for thoughtful planning to accommodate the growth while maintaining the areas' appeal.

Future Campbelltown: High-rise living around urban centres crucial to avoiding past “poor planning”
										The rising cost of living has put significant pressure on households, with around 11,500 experiencing mortgage stress in the past year. A report called "Future Campbelltown" by the Committee for Sydney highlights that Campbelltown has a higher proportion of homes with mortgages compared to the rest of Sydney. Jeremy Gill, Principal and Partner at SGS and key contributor to the report, states that the income of Campbelltown residents is typically lower, making them more vulnerable to rising interest rates.

How does the wellbeing of cities and regions influence where we choose to live?
Building on the release of the 
SGS Cities and Regions Wellbeing Index
, this article investigates early evidence of a wellbeing effect on Australia’s internal migration between 2016 and 2021. 
Before diving in, it is worth noting that migration patterns observed between the 2016 and 2021 census include the period covering the COVID-19 pandemic. This period saw changes in internal migration patterns.
Social scientists have long been interested in forms of mobility that collectively shape society’s social structure. Seminal studies in this field have charted the intergenerational mobility shaped by 
racial and gendered effects of income mobility
One of the prevailing challenges for public policy is understanding and monitoring these dimensions of mobility in real-time. Data availability, granularity, and the ability to perform data linkage present some complexities, as does the ability to isolate cause and effect for complex social phenomena. The result? Opportunity gaps tend to be invisible until it is too late.
The Cities and Regions Wellbeing Index (CRWI) is a spatially detailed measure combining communities’ performance on social, economic, and environmental indicators. Using CRWI data, we have explored population mobility through a wellbeing lens to ask: Does wellbeing affect internal migration?
What draws us to a community or place to live is both personal and shared. Household decisions on where we live are often motivated by the appeal of better opportunities for a better quality of life. Exploring the links between SGS’s Cities and Regions Wellbeing Index and Australia’s internal migration patterns helps to uncover spatial trends in where and why we move.
Figure 1 shows how moves between locations with similar wellbeing scores dominate internal migration in Australia between 2016 and 2021. This is true irrespective of which wellbeing band (Low, Medium, High) one previously lived in 2016. The visualisation is agnostic to the distances moved and instead focuses on whether internal migrants move to locations with better or lesser wellbeing outcomes.
From 2016 to 2021, 21 per cent stayed in the lower wellbeing band, 53 per cent in the medium wellbeing band, and 15 per cent in the higher wellbeing band. Note that all figures include the population who did not change their place of usual residence between the 2016 and 2021 Census (
47.9 per cent of the nation’s population
). This ensures a meaningful comparison with the inter-band movements shown in Figure 1.
Moving between bands was far less common. For example, three per cent of all internal migration was from a lower wellbeing SA3 to a medium wellbeing SA3, while 2.5 per cent of all moves were from a higher wellbeing SA3 to an SA3 of medium wellbeing. The rarest move (< 0.5 per cent of all internal migration 2016-21) consisted of moves from lower to higher wellbeing SA3s, or vice versa.
Figure 1: Relative internal migration volumes by origin and destination CRWI score, 2016-21
Source: SGS Economics and Planning (2023). Reading this chart: Each panel depicts the aggregated flows between SA3s nationally based on SA3s’ CRWI score. For example, the leftmost panel highlights the relative flow of internal migration from Origin SA3s (Place of Usual Residence in 2016) with higher wellbeing scores to Destination SA3s (Place of Usual Residence in 2021) of high, medium, and low CRWI score. For this analysis, SA3s were categorised based on the following wellbeing score thresholds: High > 5.5, 5.5 > Medium > 4.5, 4.5 > Low.
This preliminary analysis of internal migration along wellbeing lines mirrors what is also suggested elsewhere in the literature: 
that social class affects where one moves
. Termed socio-economic sorting, this describes the process of selective population shifts that is driven by determinants such as housing affordability, educational and employment opportunity, and other magnets for residential choice, all of which are reflected in the CRWI. Recent scholarship in the Australian context reveals the 
rise of residential segregation by education and occupation
The comparative analysis below highlights a stark contrast in the spatiality of moves to 
 wellbeing SA3s (Figure 2) and moves to 
 wellbeing SA3s (Figure 3). As 2016-21 internal migration characterised by a movement of +/- 2 in CRWI score was concentrated along the east coast, only this region is shown in the maps. 
The map colours show the direction of population migration while the thickness of the line shows relative volume. 
Moves of fewer than 100 people are also excluded to highlight the salient trends. 
Whereas internal migration to higher wellbeing areas is relatively contained within the Sydney and Brisbane capital city areas (Figure 2), moves to lower wellbeing areas are significantly more spatially distributed (Figure 3). The latter includes migration from Greater Sydney to NSW’s North Coast and coastal suburbs in Queensland’s Gold Coast.

Source: SGS Economics and Planning (2023)
Figure 3: Internal migration to lower wellbeing, 2016-21
Source: SGS Economics and Planning (2023)
The analysis suggests that ‘upward’ wellbeing mobility between 2016-21 was concentrated within Greater Sydney, with the exception of the migration flow from Strathpine to The Hills District, while the top 5 moves (by population volume) to a residence of lower wellbeing were distributed between Greater Sydney (Hawkesbury to Richmond – Windsor, Warringah to Wyong), Greater Brisbane (The Hills District to Strathpine, Centenary to Forest Lake – Oxley) and from Tea Tree Gully to Playford in Greater Adelaide. 
Table 1: Internal migration by wellbeing and population volume, 2016-21
Source: SGS Economics and Planning (2023). * A note about alignment between CRWI 2022 and internal migration data from the ABS Census of Population and Housing: Source data for the CRWI’s 20 indicators is predominantly drawn from the 2021 ABS Census (refer to page 50+ in the 
). Due to CRWI was commencing in 2022, a 2016 score is not available, thus there is an assumption that the relative wellbeing of cities and regions in 2016 is similar to that in 2022. Future CRWI releases will remove the requirement for this assumption. 
The above suggests that some SA3 pairings – Strathpine and The Hills District, for example – experience relatively high volumes of internal migration between them in both directions of wellbeing mobility. Other destinations, Blacktown – North, appear to draw relatively high volumes of internal migrants from lower wellbeing SA3s. 
Given the detail of the CRWI, future analysis could examine which dimension(s) of wellbeing appear to have stronger effects of migration flows. A preliminary analysis of the top five moves to higher wellbeing areas (Table 1) shows that these were moves to a neighbourhood with:
An Employment, Knowledge & Skills dimension that scores between 
 (on a scale of 0-10) than their old neighbourhood.
between 3.86 and 5.12 points higher
 (on a scale of 0-10) than their old neighbourhood. 
In comparison, the top five moves to higher wellbeing SA3s also resulted in slight decreases in the Economy dimension score, suggesting that residential choice is significantly motivated by factors beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
There is a growing spectrum of efforts to understand wellbeing at a national, regional and community level. The availability and quality of data will inform policy decisions that shapes what is needed for communities to flourish.
 This article illustrates that residents largely remain within the same objective wellbeing bands, which will impact their individual or subjective wellbeing experience. When residents do move homes, the data shows they often relocate to places with higher wellbeing according to the indicators in the framework. In moving, people seek to improve their wellbeing outcomes, particularly their economic opportunities or housing affordability. Further understanding these mobility patterns and their link to wellbeing can inform the approach to addressing the housing crisis and increasing spatial inequality.
 Federal, state and local strategic plans and policies, where possible, should seek to improve wellbeing outcomes for those living in locations with lower scores. Targeting additional housing supply could be focussed to create more opportunities to live in locations that score higher on the wellbeing index. This will help create happier, healthier and more resilient communities.

, based on data. Additionally, we released the SGS Cities & Regions Wellbeing Index, a report and interactive tool that assesses the impact of public policy decisions on people's lives in different areas.

Addressing the South East Queensland housing crisis: A path forward without more urban sprawl
The South East Queensland housing crisis presents a pressing challenge as the region grapples with the need to accommodate a rapidly growing population, projected to exceed 6 million people in the next two decades. 
At the heart of this challenge lies a critical question: How can planning in South East Queensland (SEQ) address housing needs while preserving its unique natural beauty, quality of life and biodiversity? 
The "Best Practice Report" recently released by SGS, commissioned by the 
 (QCC), proposes a way forward for metropolitan-scale planning to address housing needs while creating liveable, sustainable and productive communities. This report was prepared for QCC in the context of the recent release of a new draft SEQ Regional Plan and a public submissions period.
The report highlights the need to plan cities in a smarter way, meaning building more houses in already developed areas and making better use of existing infrastructure and services. It also found that reducing outward urban growth leads to lower living costs, greater proximity to job opportunities – especially for women with qualifications matching available jobs, and reduced transport expenses that otherwise burden household budgets.
Additionally, this strategic approach places a strong emphasis on environmental preservation, resulting in decreased habitat destruction and reduced exposure to flooding and climate hazards. 
Lead author of the report and SGS Principal and Partner 
 talks about the significance of this research:
Our Best Practice Report emphasises that there are community wide and household benefits from better planning for a more compact city.
The research and evidence tells us that if SEQ built more dwellings in already developed areas than is currently the case, the community as a whole stands to benefit and save money - because existing infrastructure and services are better utilised and less new infrastructure is required.”
— SGS Principal and Partner, Patrick Fensham
The proposed approach to planning for SEQ is built upon five pillars of good planning. These pillars are essential to ensuring that future housing in SEQ is in the right places, has the necessary amenities and services, and provides enhanced access to jobs. They are crucial for creating communities that are not only great places to live but also sustainable and productive. These five principles are the building blocks for making SEQ a more compact city. 
These need to be accompanied by clear implementation pathways – concerted action and investment will need to be directed to delivery of the agenda under each pillar in SEQ, including through:
 that align responsibilities for planning and development assessment at state, metropolitan and local levels of place and project significance, including a dedicated metropolitan governance or coordination function to ensure an SEQ wide perspective on key matters.
 (EDQ) to intervene for orderly and efficient development and to demonstrate best practice infill housing and development.
Effective mechanisms to deliver required infrastructure 
including a suite of development contributions to provide funding for infrastructure, that include user pays charges and value capture provisions.
South East Queensland is currently at a crucial point. It attracts new residents because of the economic opportunities it offers, great living conditions, and natural beauty, but the challenge of providing sufficient housing and ensuring orderly, sustainable development while protecting and enhancing its assets is significant. Our best practice report for QCC provides the principles and directions for a better future.
