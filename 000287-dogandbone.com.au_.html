While technology is all about improving our clients businesses, we often reduce their costs significantly. We love the impact this can have - often reinvesting savings in fast tracking their strategy and directly helping people in need.
In the last year we helped our clients identify savings worth over $16M through our procurement capability.
Better yet most of these savings are recurring, enabling ongoing impact & innovation.
All B Corp assessments are public  view the detail or our certification here.
We wanted to have a positive impact not just through our services but in the lives of our employees, and by using our success to fund purpose projects. We’ve built a team that really cares about our clients and each other.  
We use our profits to fund community projects, whether that be setting up a clinic on the remote island of Motalava, Vanuatu, or providing solar-powered Wi-Fi to a remote area school.
Technology is increasingly playing a significant role in caring for people and planet. We're excited that Dog & Bone is part of that!

We're inspired by organisations who exist to make the world better. Their impact is why Dog & Bone exists.
We help our clients invest more time, money and focus into their core mission of improving the world.
As a technology and telecommunications specialist, we work behind the scenes of many incredible charities and not-for-profits, helping them to improve their business functions and scale their impact.
Having a positive impact on our clients and the world is at the heart of everything we do at Dog and Bone. Whether that be through using our expertise to help our not-for-profit clients save money on telco bills, giving our time to small charities who can't afford an IT strategy, donating our money to environmental projects or advocating for better charity pricing with vendors, our impact is what drives our team to succeed.
With this in mind, we developed a four pillar impact framework which helps to guide all our decisions. From recruitment and policies right through to the clients we choose to work with, we aim to maximise our social impact and contribute to making the world better.
This year our team are proud of the huge impact we have had, with some of the achievements including:
Launched a Pro Bono Impact Grants program providing $120,000 of project annually to small charities
Achieved $9.4 million savings to our telco clients
Saved thousands of hours of efficiencies for NFP staff through our tech projects and advice
Recommitted to our B Corp certification
We would like to thank all of our valued clients and partners who have helped us maximise our social impact  in 2022 and we are excited about what we can achieve together in 2023.
As a specialist in tech and telco, we don’t work directly with the beneficiaries of charities and not-for-profits. In order to maximise our positive social impact, we developed our Impact Framework. This model guides our decisions and helps to ensure our business delivers the greatest good.
Maximise social impact and create a better world by giving our time, money, expertise and voice
One of the most scalable ways we can have a positive impact is through the work we do. Through delivery of great technology and telecommunications outcomes for our charity and NFP clients, we improve both their effiency and effectiveness.
Having an impact means more than just working with great purpose-driven clients. We seek out and donate to organisations and initiatives that are delivering outsized impact, such as bringing solar power to isolated communities.
In order to expand the number of organisations we help, we created the Impact Grants program, offering $120,000 in pro bono services to smaller NFPs that need support with their technology.
We have a responsibility to use our influence and resources to advocate on issues of impact, such as attending climate action protests and hosting events championing the B Corp community.
We’ve achieved a lot in a year. Here’s the last 12 months by the numbers.
Cost reduction in technology and telco
Pro bono, discounts and Impact Grants
Addressing our carbon footprint through sustainable projects
We strive to work primarily with not-for-profits and charities, with a focus on helping them mimimise waste and inefficiency, and maximise their impact.
Savings across Telco projects and management
Well-managed telecommunications help not-for-profits stay on top of vendor relationships, save money, manage devices and ensure teams get the right services.
Removed telco services with no usage
The complexities of telecommunications for any organisation mean service needs change constantly, and it’s easy to miss when they’re no longer needed. Our ongoing analysis routinely identifies opportunities to remove unused services and save money.
Resolved billing issues and applied credits
Billing errors or inconsistencies are an unavoidable part of the modern telco ecosystem. Through proactive engagement with providers, we resolved hundreds of costly issues.
Beyond simply monitoring usage, our telco experts regularly identify areas of saving for our clients, such as inefficient plans, unclaimed discounts, duplicated services or system inefficiencies.
Anglicare Victoria sees immediate and long-term benefits of Telco Management
Seven years of savings and benefits through management of their telco services under a Telco Management for Anglicare Victoria.
Telco savings and efficiencies for Aboriginal child care agency
VACCA now has their telco management outsourced so more time and money can be spent on their service delivery to the community.
The monthly Dog and Bone telco reporting and analysis is second to none and the services have resulted in substantial cost savings for VACCA.
The technology not-for-profits use should empower their people and scale their impact.
Helping NFPs choose the right systems and tools
Correct system selection is essential for the long term success of not-for-profits. Making sure the technology ecosystem is future proof saves time and money in the long run. Through running system procurement processes, reviewing and improving use of current systems, organisations can ensure they are maximizing their resources and meeting their goals efficiently.
Selecting, working with and getting the best value out of managed services providers can be very complex, and inefficiencies often arise. We worked with several not-for-profits to review and select their MSPs, helping to ensure the right ongoing fit for the organisation and reducing waste and overheads.
As organisations grow and evolve, their technology landscape often changes in inefficient ways, with multiple redundant systems and manual business processes slowing things down. By identifying and removing redundancies, as well as implementing workflow automations, we've saved our clients and their staff countless hours.

Bold claims are all well and good - we verified our ethics by becoming a B Corp through a rigorous auditing of our governance, treatment of staff, customers, environment and the community. We do this to ensure we run an ethical and sustainable business.
Over the last 20 years helping purpose-driven organisations maximise their technology and telco, we noticed many smaller not-for-profits who couldn't afford the professional services that would help them have an even greater positive impact on the community.​
In order to expand the number of organisations we help, in late 2021 we created the Impact Grants program, offering $120,000 per financial year in pro bono services to smaller NFPs that need support with their technology.
Since the inception of the Impact Grants program, we have awarded grants to seven worthy organisations.
In addition to our grants, we also provide additional hours of work pro bono, to ensure the success of our purpose-driven clients.

As an organisation, we use our voice in multiple ways:

Running webinars in the depths of Covid lockdown to assist charities to adapt to rapid shifts in technology requirements
Advocate for the best telco rates through VTS transitions

A strategy focusing on key capabilities that have broad impact; like selecting a primary application such as a case management or finance system.
Detailed assessment of all key ISO standards across organisational strategic pillars.

We are really happy we engaged Dog and Bone to assist us with our IT strategy.

The reality for most workplaces is now a hybrid of office and remote working. It's important to maintain connection, collaboration and the quality of your services.
Many organisations find themselves using different technologies and platforms to communicate and collaborate. With the technologies available now you can move everything from your phone system, instant messaging and document collaboration into one platform so it's more efficient and easier to use.
A clear Information Management Strategy can help you control how you store information, who can see it and protect sensitive data, empowering your team to easily retrieve and save information whilst keeping your organisation secure.
