Here at Nakie we are passionate about the environment and have created an eco friendly outdoor brand. Our hammock, bug net and tarp combos have been designed for ultimate comfort. Each hammock is made from a soft lightweight, breathable recycled material allowing a cosy and restful night sleep. The bugnet and tarp cocoon the hammock and provide protection from the weather and any creepy crawlers. 
When we created the Nakie hammock combos we focussed on producing an ultra light hammock, bug net and tarp to be used for hiking, camping, or any adventure. We wanted a hammock set up that was extremely portable and easy use. Each hammock bug net and tarp combo weighs just 2.5kg and is nice and compact, easily fitting in your backpack. Set up is quick and easy in fact it can take less than 10 minutes to set up and be relaxing in a Nakie hammock, bug net and tarp combo. 
Our hammocks have carefully been designed from 100% post consumer recycled plastic bottles. Each Nakie hammock is crafted from 37 post consumer plastic bottles pulled from landfll. The hammock has an impressive weight rating of 225kg or 500LBLs making it perfect for two people. Crafted with triple stitching & uniquely designed polyester end straps for increased strength and durability a Nakie hammock is built to last lifetime. 
Our Nakie Bug nets are crafted from an extremely fine noseeum micro-mesh providing protection from all insects whilst still remaining cool and breathable. 
Finally our tarps are designed to provide protection from any sun, rain and other weather events. Our tarps have been carefuly designed with multiple anchor points providing more flexibilty and options on how they are set up to suit any enviroment. 
Each Nakie hammock, bugnet and tarp is made from the absolute best quality money can buy and comes with a lifetime warranty and 30 day money back guarantee. So what are you waiting for?
Can I use a bug net without a tarp?
Absolutely! our bug net can be set up with out a tarp so you can sleep under the stars. The only risk is if it rains. The bug net offers no protection from the weather. 
Does a bug net keep all insects out?
Yes it sure does. Each bug net is crafted from an extremely fine noseeum micro-mesh stopping even the tiniest of bugs getting in. 
Does a rain tarp protect my hammock from rain?
Of course! Our rain tarps are constructed of 3000mm PU coated waterproof ripstop polyester with non-toxic dual silicone, and heat taped seams to ensure it is 100% waterproof. 
Can I sleep in my hammock combo for multiple days?
For sure! Studies have shown a number of health benefits of sleeping in a hammock. These include a deeper sleep from the rocking sensation, reduced muscle aches and pains from the equal pressure on all parts of your body and improve your sleep posture.

Why you should buy a Nakie blanket
Here at Nakie we are passionate about the environment and have created and eco conscious outdoor brand. Our outdoor blanket is made from 100% recycled material. 54 plastic bottles to be precise. Our puffy blankets consist of 600 fill-power with 500 grams recycled plastic bottles to ensure you stay warm and cosy. The blankets outer shell is made from 90/10 DWR this provides a stain and water resistants. 
Our blankets have been inspired by puffy down jackets. We love the warm cosy feeling of a down jacket and wanted to create it in a blanket form. We also wanted to remain environmentally conscious. Thats how the sustainable down outdoor blanket was created.
The Nakie outdoor blanket has been designed to be used both indoors and outdoors and is a must for your next camping or hiking adventure. Crafted with a cape clip a nakie blanket allows you to roam free whilst staying cosy and warm. Setting up camp, sitting by the fire or playing games you can wear your blanket like a cape and enjoy all the social activities. 
Our Nakie blanket is also the perfect companion for your next night spent in a swag, hammock or tent. They are light and compact making them easy to pack. Our blankets weigh only 780 grams and easily pack away in a stuff sack. 
Like all Nakie products we offer a lifetime warranty and 30 day money back guarantee what are you waiting for?
Four trees planted for every product sold. 
How do I wash my blanket?
To wash your blanket please use a cold machine wash with a non bleaching detergent. Once the blanket is washed to help it stay nice and puffy pop it in the table dryer on AIR DRY only with a couple of clean tennis balls. 
Can I use my blanket to sleep with?
Absolutely! Our blankets are made for both indoor and outdoor use and are great for use whilst sleeping in a tent or hammock when camping or hiking. Whilst they haven't been officially temperature tested they are definitely cosy and warm. 
Whilst our Nakie blankets are not 100% waterproof they are water resistant. We use a 90/10 DWR this provides a stain and water resistants. In most cases water will bead off your blanket rather than being absorbed. Unless it is full submerged or completely saturated. This is usually more than enough protection from the elements. 
Why would I want a cape clip?
The Cape Clip on all Nakie Blankets, gives you the freedom to wear your blanket as a cape while getting things done. Reading a book, roasting marshmallows or even drinking a beer. It allows you to stay cosy and warm whilst enjoying the outdoors.

Yes you can! however you will not be protected from and insects. They can still fly up underneath the tarp. So for ultimate comfort we recommend using the bug net and tarp together.

‘Enjoying nature, leaving nothing but footprints and memories’
Here at Nakie we have a passion for nature and enjoy the beautiful scenery the world has to offer. We love to venture off the beaten path in an endeavor to relax and explore leaving nothing but memories and footprints.
We understand the world is bigger than us and can see the negative impact humans can have on the environment. That is why we are working hard to do our part to contribute to sustainable living and reducing carbon emissions.
Here at Nakie we want to be part of the solution. 
We are using recycle bottles to create our hammocks. Each 
. This not only gives these bottles a new life but helps remove them from land fill and hopefully decreases the amount of plastic we are seeing in our waterways. Plastic in land fill takes on average 400 years to break down. 
Another benefit of recycling plastic is that is significantly reduces the amount of energy and raw materials required to create our hammocks. This essentially results in lowered CO2 emissions and 
So far we have have saved over 
 from land fill and entering our waterways. We know we will only touch the surface, but we want to challenge each and every one of you to make a conscious decision when deciding what you buy and how you live. We truly believe it is our responsibility to preserve this world for future generations.
100,000 acres of forest is cleared around the world every day. Trees play a vital role in reducing air pollution and converting carbon dioxide into the oxygen we need to breathe. They also significantly reduce carbon emissions and help the fight in climate change.
Nakie is committed to reforestation. Currently we plants 
 for every item purchased and we have already planted 
 in the atmosphere. They are one of the most effective tools in the fight against dangerous greenhouse gases that are contributing to climate change and global warming. They are extremely efficient in long term 
. They get there energy from sunlight and use the process of photosynthesis to take carbon dioxide from the air and water from the ground. In the process of turning it into wood they release oxygen into the air. They also assist soil in capturing significant amounts of carbon. Large-scale 
. Trees also provide a habitat for animals, purify water sources, control flooding and erosion and help to replenish the soil with nutrients needed for farming.
Here at Nakie we want future generations to have the same opportunity to enjoy the beauty of the world the way we do. That's why we are planting 4 trees for every product purchased. 
Where are we planting our trees?
We are planting our trees in our own reserve in 
 The site is called Ankilahila mangrove and is 183 hectares.  Madagascar is the fourth-largest island on the planet (4 times the size of the UK) and situated off the east coast of Africa. It is home to over 200,000 species of plants and animals that do not exist anywhere else in the world. Sadly many of these plant and animal species are now endangered as only
 10% of Madagascar's original forest remains
 today. The rest has been cleared and used for fossil fuels and other trades within the community.
 and is heavily dependent on foreign humanitarian aid in order to meet the food, health and educational needs of their people. For many of us we take for granted the easy access we have to clean water, food on the table and a roof over our heads. For many Madagascan people these are considered luxury's. It is believed at least 50 % of Madagascan people are living below the poverty line and 70% are living off 
We want to do our part to not only help the planet but also the people. That is why we have committed to a minimum
 5 year reforestation project in north west Madagascar
. All of our trees are planted by local villagers who are struggling to find work and provide for there families.
What kind of trees are we planting? 
At the moment we are planting a range of different trees including fruit trees and a large number of mangrove trees. 
A large number of mangroves trees are being planted most of the mangrove population in Madagascar has been slashed and removed leaving the land unprotected from swell and storms resulting in areas being wash away from the ocean. Mangrove trees also absorb 4 times more carbon dioxide than any other tree species. Majority of this carbon is stored in the mangrove root system which also key in preventing erosion.
