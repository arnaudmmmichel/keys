How does Verso deliver professional inquiry that leads to sustained school improvement?
Check-ins are ready made, research-informed and can be launched to multiple classes in just 2 clicks. Verso Check-ins provide an opportunity for student reflection and formative assessment.
Every student can share with their teacher:
Key insights into what they are learning;
The teaching strategies that help them the most; and
How they are feeling about their learning.
Supervised machine learning codes student responses for the teacher, revealing how the lesson was received and the support required to move learning forward.
Teachers can share Check-in data with a coach or selected colleagues, allowing teachers to comment on each otherâs data and share expertise to support growth and development.
Previous Check-ins are collated for teachers to show their impact and growth over time. Teachers use their confidential personalised dashboard to set and monitor priorities and select areas for development.
Classroom data is collated to produce whole school or system-wide reports. School data can be used to set and monitor progress against priorities and can be viewed by school, subject and year level.
Each studentâs homepage is a dashboard on how they are engaging in their learning and highlights preferred classroom strategies, supporting agency, ownership and self-management.

Versoâs unique Instant Check-in uses supervised machine learning to reveal student understanding and wellbeing during the lesson.
Checking in with students provides actionable feedback on how lessons are being received by learners, informing adjustments in planning and practice to amplify teacher impact.
âThe best classroom data I have ever seenâ
Student responses across core subjects are coded by Verso using the rubric below and used by school leadership to measure impact
*The percentage of students that leave the classroom being able to clearly explain what they were learning
To arrange a product demonstration and see real data from one of our case-study schools
Students who can explain what they are learning in class feel more positive
As part of the Verso Instant Check-in students are required to answer the question: How did you feel during todayâs lesson?
Students are given a list of 16 adjectives to select from. Those students who could clearly explain what they are learning were 60% more likely to select only positive adjectives from the list.
Research shows that within just 10 check-ins, teachers use the Verso dashboards to adjust their teaching and increase the percentage of students who can clearly explain what they are learning by 51%.

Introducing our New Learning Journey Framework
Following conversations with our partner schools, we are excited to announce an exciting adaptation to our student check-in form. We are trialing an adaptation to the question which previously asked students to ârate the level of challenge on a scale of 1-5â.
Introducing our New Learning Journey Framework
Following conversations with our partner schools, we are excited to announce an exciting adaptation to our student check-in form.
We are trialing an adaptation toÂ  the question which previously asked students to â
rate the level of challenge on a scale of 1-5â
With a continued focus on the level of challenge, we are now providing students with a more focused framework to help them reflect on their progress and the next steps on their learning journey.Â 
From recall of prior knowledge to deeper understanding, application and transfer, this simple taxonomy maps the cognitive progression students undergo while learning, providing a valuable source of feedback for teachers who want to focus on the level of challenge in their instruction and differentiation.
Fig 2. Learning Journey slider indicating the Verso framework
Our new framework allows you to support students to select the statement that best describes their current position on their learning journey.offering. The teacher dashboard then offers valuable insight into each student's progress, and ability to then group students based on their individual selections allows you to provide more tailored learning experiences, and targeted support, ensuring every student receives the guidance they need to flourish.
At the heart of our approach is your feedback and expertise. We invite you to try out the new framework and share your thoughts. Your valuable insights will be pivotal in shaping the future of this transformative learning journey, empowering you to make even greater strides in student growth and achievement.
Your passion and dedication are what make a difference, and we're here to support you every step of the way!
Check in with your students today and let us know what you think. We would love to hear your feedback.
Crossing the rigor divide: A new lens on the journey from knowing to understanding
Knowing and understanding are two sides of the same coin. They are both important, and they work together as essential elements on a studentâs learning journey.Â 
Crossing the rigor divide: A new lens on the journey from knowing to understanding
âAny fool can know. The point is to understand.â â Albert Einstein
Knowing and understanding are two sides of the same coin. They are both important, and they work together as essential elements on a studentâs learning journey.Â 
Knowing is about facts, while understanding is about concepts. Knowing is the ability to recall information. It asks for memorization or basic recall of
data which have been previously presented, while understanding is the ability to make sense of information. ItÂ  is about being able to apply what you have learnt to solve problems, make decisions or connect with the world. Knowing is about collecting building blocks (Quantitative). Understanding is the arranging and rearranging of the blocks to build something new (Qualitative). Knowing is surface-level, while understanding is deep. Knowing is about being able to repeat, while understanding is about being able to explain.
When analyzing student responses to the Verso check-in, whether by machine learning, a Verso learning specialist or collaboratively with peers in PLCs in our partner schools, a frequent observation is that students appear to value the sharing of facts acquired in a lesson rather than demonstrating understanding of the learning objective.Â 
There may be a number of reasons for this, including:
When sharing the learning objective, instead of completing the sentence âWe are learning toâ¦â, a large percentage of students replaceÂ  the hard coded sentence starter with âWe are learning aboutâ¦â. Students reporting that they were âlearning about the civil warâ could position collection of facts over understanding of concepts such as cause and effect or periodization. Whereas, âWe are learning to identify the causes of the civil warâ requires students to demonstrate conceptual understandingâ
The widespread use of multiple choice assessments and quizzes often sends a message that memorization is the goal of learning and students are rewarded for recall.
A large percentage of students who self asses as âalmost thereâ qualify their assessment by saying that they âjust need to remember all the factsâ
Pacing guides can push teachers into doing the heavy lifting on behalf of their students so rather than investigating events that could be considered causes of WW1, students are given the mnemonic MAIN and asked to remember it.Â 
Students do not have access to criteria or a framework to use for demonstrating understanding
Students may not understand the difference between knowing and understanding, and may therefore value the ability to recall information over the ability to understand it.
In these classes it is also rare to see students reporting a level of challenge (on a scale of 1-5) that is higher than 2. Again this could be due to a number of factors, and as such has not been as useful as we would have hoped for the teacher in reflecting on their learning design, orÂ  for the student in understanding where to go next.
For this reason, we are trialing a new reflection question.Â 
Instead of asking students to consider how challenging they found their learning, we have developed a simple taxonomy that allows students to think about where they are on their journey as a learner.
Fig 1. Sliding scale indicating every statement on the learning journey
Students are now asked to select a statement on a sliding scale from 1-5 that best fits where they are on their learning journey. Every stage after stage 1 offers a success point. (Fig 1)
The taxonomy supports the transition from surface (Levels 2 and 3) to deep (Levels 3 and 4) and creates a shared language for learning.
Levels 2 and 3 require students to collect the building blocks that are required to be connected in levels 4 and 5. It is only at levels 4 and 5 that students can start to transition from knowing to being able to explain , apply and transfer.Â 
It is intendedÂ  that the taxonomy will allow students to think about their learning in a new way, whilst also presenting a common framework for evaluating and designing learning experiences. It will inform the development of success criteria and rubrics designed to lead students in successfully progressing through each stage of the learner journey and making the transition from âknowing about..â to being able to âdemonstrate understanding ofâ¦â.Â

Make Every Check-in Count Top 10 Tips
The following tips are designed for teachers and students to get the most from the Check-in experience.
Invest in building a strong connection with the learning objective
. This should be referred to frequently throughout the lesson, as students transition from one activity to the next, before returning to it at the end to consolidate learning and provide a framework for students to monitor their progress. Reflection is not a test to see if students can remember what was shared at the start of the lesson. Focus on all parts of the learning objective. There should be a verb, noun and context and all three elements are important to the process.
âFind time to take a momentâ
 Reflection should be seen as an essential part of the learning process and as such it needs to be valued. Make sure to allocate sufficient time and avoid asking students to reflect as part of a homework assignment. The check-in needs to be in the moment.Â 
 to explain the process to students and ways that their feedback can make a difference.
Model the process with your students
. Talk to your students about your own learning process and how you reflect on your own learning. This will help them understand what reflection is and why it is important.
. Students need to feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings about their learning. Make sure they understand that their check-in responses can not and will not be seen by their classmates.Â 
. Reflection should not be something that students do only once in a while. It should be a regular part of their learning process. Consider checking in with students when:
- you have made an adaptation to your practice,Â 
- at a criticalÂ  stage of the learning journey such as preparing to transition from surface to deep.Â 
Walk students through the questions and prompts. Talk about how each question requires them to think. Explain what a great response might look like. Provide copies of the Verso Student Reflection Guide to support their thinking.
 Give students feedback on the quality of their responses. This will help them improve their reflective skills.
Show that their voices are being heard
. Start the next lesson with statements such as â
I read your reflections and noticed thatâ¦. So today we are going toâ¦.â.
Make sure the language of the classroom is focused on learning rather than doing. Try to be precise. Avoid vague statements such as âWe are learning aboutâ¦.â as this, in the absence of strong success criteria, lacks the clarity required to support self assessment.
How we are learning is as important as what we are learning.Another look at the problem of âlearning aboutâ¦â
Customizing the check-in form using VersoâsÂ  library of over 230 additional prompts or adding prompts of your ownÂ 
The importance of clarity and the curse of ambiguity.
Before checking in with students for the first time, it is important to remember that reflection is a skill that takes time and practice to develop. We can not make assumptions that studentsâ capacity to critically engage with their learning improves with age. Nor can we assume that when presented with a series of prompts on a check-in form, students will know how to apply their thinking to the task in a manner that supports them in sharing what they have learned, what they need to improve, or selecting strategies that they believe would move their learning forward.
As teachers, we can help our students learn to reflect by providing them with frequent and purposeful opportunities to do so. Reflection should not be something that students only do once in a while. It should be seen as a valuable and regular part of the learning process.
The following video was filmed in a series of classrooms where students were using Verso Check-in for the first time. The students were given an introduction to the process and how each question required them to think and respond. The teacher introduction was designed to help students who were new to the process to avoid some common pitfalls. Specifically, students were asked to be precise and thoughtful. They were given possible sentence starters such as âI learned thatâ¦â, and reminded of the difference between sharing what they did as opposed to sharing what they had learned in the lesson. Finally, you will see that students were asked to use evidence to support their self-assessment and to be specific when seeking support from the teacher.
Reflection capable learners: Making the shift from teacher dependency
Nora Abushakra is a highly regarded middle school educator and Social Studies teacher in South Carolina. She has been a leading exponent of the use of the Verso Check-in tool for the past 18 months and has been hugely influential in aligning the use of the tool with her districtâs cycle of professional inquiry and her individual schoolâs continuously evolving pedagogical framework. As a highly reflective practitioner with a keen interest in student voice and agency, Nora has recently started to experiment with the use of single point rubrics as a tool to support the studentÂ  reflection process, and as a means to give students more ownership of their learning. In doing so she aims to support students in finding and applying their voice to the learning process with greater precision, ensuring that the feedback students provide is specific, accurate and actionable. In this article, Nora shares her exploratory work and her ongoing professional quest to translate educational research into effective classroom practice.
As educators, we all know that it is our duty to facilitate learning for all of our students. We do our best to plan activities that ensure that we are doing just that but, in the end, are we asking students to just âdoâ tasks or are we asking them to âlearnâ?Â  Professor, John Hattie, wrote that a studentâs ârole is not simply to do tasks as decided by teachers, but to actively manage and understand their learning gainsâ (2012). Â  Hattie goes on to say that this is a challenging task for educators.Â  It requires the educator to introspect their own practice and empower students to do the same work on their own. Â  However, if students are unclear about the purpose of their learning, the activities that are planned to help them get there are all for naught.Â  That is why I appreciate Philâs analogy of learning as a journey.Â  It truly is and I will soon point out how itÂ  applies to Professor Hattieâs discussion above.Â Â 
For a moment, imagine you have been told you must travel to a new city and that you must reach it by the next day.Â  You have never traveled there and you do not know how far it is nor the directions you should take.Â  What obstacles will you face along the way?Â  Do you need a car or is public transportation available?Â  The stakes are high, though, so you have no other option but to attempt to make it there. Feels hopeless, right?Â  If you were just handed the keys to help you reach your destination,Â  would you instantly become more likely to arrive on time? Likewise, we cannot expect our students to be successful on their learning journey if we do not tell them where they are going and equip them with the tools and resources to help them get there.Â Â Â 
Returning to Professor Hattieâs quote, he reminded us that the goal is for students to be able to manage and understand their learning gains.Â  Rubrics and reflection are the means to that end.Â  Rubrics help students to navigate their own path, while reflection aids them in understanding where they are at any given point and what they need to move forward. Â  Together, they provide a roadmap to success.Â 
Recently, I was teaching a unit on urbanization.Â  The learning objective, or final destination, for the unit was to understand the impact of urbanization on a global level.Â  Planning backward, my content area team and I decided on the following success criteria, or rest stops, along the way. We wanted students to be able to:
List benefits and negative effects of urbanization
Discuss the significance of the 2030 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals
Relate the 2030 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals to urbanization
Compare sustainable cities and traditional cities.Â 
Design a sustainable city using the 2030 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals
I created the rubric below for the students to track, or manage, their progress toward owning their learning.Â  I gave each student this rubric at the beginning of class and went over it in detail.Â Â Â Â Â 
The left hand column presents students with a series of success criteria in order of increasing complexity. The right side of the rubric gives students a space to reflect.Â  Take note that it asks students to write what they need to be able to advance to the next level.Â  You may be thinking that you have been asking students to assess their own level of learning all along.Â  However, I invite you to think about the difference between the data you have collected as a result of your practice and the data you could potentially receive from these rubrics.Â Â 
Why is this better?Â  Most students, when asked to assess their learning, are going to only think about whether or not they have completed the task at hand, rather than where they are on their learning journey .Â  Their reflections are too frequently focused on completion and compliance. With this approach I provided students with a roadmap that would allow them to take control of their own learning.Â  As this is not a task list, students are focused on whether they have mastered the learning, making their reflection feedback more valuable.Â 
With this approach I am beginning to shift balance in my classroom. Students are now able toÂ  describe their current level of knowledge, skills and understanding. They can use the rubric throughout the lesson to monitor their progress and self and peer-assess against clearly defined and understood learning goals.Â 
Having the data in one place and students being able to clearly and accurately articulate their learning has been a game-changer for me.Â Â 
The student feedback data allows me to see if the strategies I am employing are working. I can use student feedback to adapt next learning steps or make micro adjustments to my practice and plan interventions to meet the needs of every student more effectively.Â 
I leave you with a snapshot of additional reflection data taken using Verso check-ins.Â  The first is prior to my use of rubrics to inform reflection and learning, and the second was taken at the end of this unit.Â  As you can see, the impact has been phenomenal. Not only has the process managed to connect students more closely with their learning, it has also given students the means to employ a shared language to seek feedback and discuss their learning with their peers and myself .
Check-in data also has revealed that students are nowÂ  far more able to evidence their self-assessment using details of what they had learnt, and students who were confused could precisely pinpoint the stage of the learning journey where they needed support.
