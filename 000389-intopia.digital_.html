It’s never too late to talk accessibility – we can help at any stage.
We can check your website, mobile app, software, portal, component, or online content against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). We'll give you advice on accessibility best practices that aren’t in WCAG too.
We hate droning lectures, so we’ve created interesting and occasionally irreverent sessions directly related to what you do. We want you to be able to use this stuff as soon as you leave the training room.
Our strategy services can help you make digital accessibility part of your company’s DNA.
Our consultants can work with your whole team, providing design feedback and requirements, code advice and testing guidance.
We want to connect you directly with the users that matter the most when it comes to digital accessibility. 
Our consultants will work with you to determine the right people to be in your testing sessions. We handle the recruitment, and if you need us to, we can also facilitate the sessions. Our team has extensive experience in helping you get the feedback you need.

We believe in a better digital experience for everyone.
Digital accessibility isn’t our job – it’s our passion.
Adem, Sarah and Stewart founded Intopia in October 2015. Their vision: a socially-aware boutique digital agency that promoted inclusive design and development. Put another way: let’s make things better for people that need it more than most.
The Intopia team includes a diverse range of backgrounds, views, abilities, and work experience. We don’t do groupthink – we often have robust discussions, usually about WCAG interpretations and coding options but occasionally about the best viewing order of a Star Wars movie marathon.
In our experience most digital accessibility issues stem from lack of awareness, not intentional exclusion, so we’re doing everything we can to close the knowledge gap.
We discuss and share accessibility news through 
We go to, speak at and run accessibility conferences and community meetups.
We regularly review our accessibility training courses and reference library content so it includes the latest proven techniques and examples.
In our testing we explain how issues affect users to remind people of the human impact beyond the bug report.
Intopia is a social enterprise, committed to supporting those that help others. We give five percent of our revenue to community and non-profit organisations that support access, inclusion, and women in technology.
