Wimmera Native Nursery and The Native Shop acknowledges the Traditional Owners of the land on which we work. We pay our respects to their culture and to Elders past, present and emerging. 
Government regulations prohibit 'Myrtacea Family' plants being sent into South Australia. We cannot send any live plants to Western Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory or overseas.
Orders are sent out every Monday (excluding Public Holidays) via Australia Post. This is to ensure that they have sufficient time to reach their destinations prior to the weekend and that the customer receives healthy, happy plants. 
If a there is a National Public Holiday, shipments for that week could be delayed until the following Monday to ensure your plants have enough time to arrive.
To ensure your order meets the Monday postal service, please place all orders by 4 pm the previous Friday. Orders placed after this time will be placed in the following Monday's shipment.
Once your order is shipped, you will receive an email from The Native Shop with your tracking number. Large orders are shipped in multiple boxes and will have numerous tracking numbers. Our website system online allows one tracking number to be inputted but keep an eye out for your Australia Post notifications that will display the other tracking numbers.
If your order is large and in multiple boxes, it is out of our control if the order arrives separately. If you have any queries about your order once it has left The Native Shop/Wimmera Native Nursery, then please contact Australia Post directly.
Unfortunately as we do not work for Australia post and have no control over their processes and procedures once packages have been delivered to them it is then in Australia posts hands. You will have to discuss matters such as where your package is and delays with Australia Post. We do not actually have access to their system and receive the same information as you receive.
You are welcome to select 'Local Pick Up' at checkout for FREE and you will be notified when your order can be collected from Wimmera Native Nursery. We are located at 60 Nhill rd Dimboola 3414 Victoria.
Shipping costs will vary depending on the weight and size of your order. Costs are calculated at the checkout by combining weights of the products you have selected. Our postage costs are also inclusive of the costs incurred for packaging the plants safely, hence the term Postage and Handling you will notice at checkout. Our online portal does not calculate orders exceeding 12kg. Please contact the nursery on 03 5389 1193 or email 
 to place your order and get an accurate shipping price.
Generally insurance is for large orders but is processed through the nursery and not the online store. If you wish to purchase insurance for your order please contact the nursery on 03 5389 1193 or email
