Design & Innovation for Happier Communities
Let’s collaborate to solve problems that matter for people and our planet, be financially succesful, and increase your wellbeing
Dynamic4 is a social enterprise and certified B Corp focused on design and innovation for happier communities.
Our purpose is to help create the conditions for people and communities to be happier and have increasing quality of life – be more empowered and inclusive, and live in more regenerative ways.
We play at the place where design, regenerative innovation, and wellbeing meet.
Our focus is helping leaders and founders solve problems that matter in more empathic and innovative ways – to create great outcomes for people and our planet while being financially successful and increasing their wellbeing.
The people we can help the most are:
Social enterprise and startup founders who want to embed purpose and impact in their business model and avoid becoming broke, burnt out, and isolated.
Leaders and changemakers in established organisations (corporates, NFPs, and governments) who want to increase their focus, clarity, and wellbeing – to move forward and build momentum with more confidence.
Business, design, and innovation students in collaboration with educators who want to design and deliver experiential project-based learning experiences.
We take a human-centred design and innovation approach to helping our clients design, build, and launch regenerative business models with embedded impact and a clear value exchange that delivers and scales their impact and thrives in a connected world.
We have a range of products at different price points. They all integrate thinking and practices from action learning, positive neuroscience, design thinking/human-centred design, regenerative business model innovation, and agile ways of working.

What people expect from business is shifting. The evidence shows talent, customers, and investors are increasingly expecting businesses to do great things for people, communities, and our planet while being profitable. This directly contributes to helping create the conditions where people and communities have increasing quality of life, are happier, and live on a planet that is cleaner and healthier.
The way Dynamic4 can contribute most is to help transform the way business is done – to accelerate and embed the trend toward regenerative business models, products, and services. We do this by helping leaders and founders solve problems that matter in more empathic and innovative ways – and increase their wellbeing while they do it. That’s why Dynamic4 exists.

We specialise in helping social enterprises, purpose-driven organisations, and financial services companies.

We’d love to have a chat to see how we can work together.
