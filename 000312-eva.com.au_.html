                    Totally in love, couldn’t be happier.
"This sofa is fantastic and I really couldn’t be happier. I was initially nervous about buying online, sight unseen, especially not knowing the fabric quality but the return policy gave me confidence to go ahead and I’m so glad I did. I love everything about this sofa…the fabric was even better than I hoped for, beautiful soft grey with a lovely texture, very nice quality. I love the modular nature of this sofa and the flexibility it will give me in future houses - I plan on keeping this sofa for a long time."
"I purchased the timber bed frame and the standard mattress and I have to admit that I have had the best sleep in years! The shipping was fast and and the items were super easy to install thanks to the online video tutorials. This has been the best investment and I highly recommend these products."
                    Great bed and excellent customer service
"Highly recommend, love our Eva bed! Mattress is super comfortable, no more back pain, and the frame SO easy to put together. Eva has thought of all the little things… which make this a great product and exceptional company. Happy to support them."
"I regret not buying this couch sooner! Don’t be put off by not being able to see it in person, the colour is so accurate, and it is very comfy! The delivery was also amazing, super quick and assembly was easy i could do it by myself! Definitely recommend!"
                    Beautiful minimalist pieces at affordable prices
"We were after moderate priced quality furniture that would give a minimalist look to our bedroom. We are so happy with our purchases; they are better than I’d imagined which is always the surprise you want. The service, delivery speed and communication made for a fabulous buying experience. We wanted to know that the materials were ethically sourced and really appreciated the transparency around this which was easily accessible on the Eva website. Thank you Eva!"
"I’m so impressed with my new Kin 4 seater. It fit perfectly into my apartment lifestyle and I’m easily able to move it around based on how many people are over for dinner. I love the solid timber and the high quality finish. I’ll have this table for a long time."
                    Very happy with our Eva Everyday sofa!
"Wanted this sofa for ages, and finally bit the bullet... so glad we did! It looks so stylish and is comfortable. Was worried about the low back, but it’s not an issue at all, and is actually very supportive. Slight delay in delivery, but far better than most furniture companies, and was kept informed by Eva staff the whole time. Highly recommend Eva and the everyday sofa!"
                    Very happy with my Eva purchase
"I love my new bed and side tables. The customer service was excellent, delivery was smooth and assembling my new furniture was super straight forward and easy. Even managed it after a full day of moving. The quality is great, and they look lovely in my new space. Would definitely recommend Eva."
"I purchased the bed frame, mattress and bedside tables. The design is simple and stylish. The tables have little extras - wooden coasters and drawer dividers. Absolute dream to assemble."

You don't need to flip the mattress as it is designed to have the memory foam layer on the top and the pocket springs at the bottom, however rotating the mattress 180 degrees every few months will allow for even weight dispersion and increase the longevity of the mattress.
The top layer of the Premium Adapt Mattress can be easily unzipped and placed in a washing machine.
Be sure to wash on a gentle cycle (max. 30 degrees) using a mild detergent, then line dry in shade. Do not tumble dry. Do not bleach. Iron at a medium temperature (max. 110 degrees celsius).
Although the fabric is machine washable, overwashing may affect its performance.

      Do you and your partner have different ideas of what's comfortable?
      Our half-half configuration option allows you to adjust each half of the bed to a different firmness level.
A great solution to uncomfortable sleeping conditions. Its sustainability considerations and a comprehensive testing process led to the development of customisable options for different people’s preferences — fantastic!
              Nine comfort options. One hybrid mattress. Infinitely better sleep.
              Start with Soft, Medium and Firm in every mattress. With up to six more firmnesses to find the perfect fit. All free of charge.
95% of customers find their perfect fit
Award-winning mattress makers, thousands of 5-star reviews and hundreds of hours of user testing. The Premium Adapt Mattress has been designed to be the only mattress you’ll ever need. 
If your initial three firmnesses still aren't right, you have six other firmnesses to try to get the perfect fit. 
If you and your partner have different firmness needs, you can order half-half firmness layers. Maybe you love a firm, supportive mattress, but they like to melt into a marshmallow at bedtime. Now you can have both. 
FOAM & SPRINGS FOR BETTER SUPPORT
Over 650 twice tempered steel pocket springs plus three built-in Certipur-US® approved firmness options. Simply “unzip and flip” the top layer to adjust for a true custom system.  
A mattress that grows with you
Soft to cradle pregnancy or joint pains
Medium when you need more support
Firm to help back pains and aches
The removable, machine-washable topper maintains perfect temperature while you sleep.
Our tri-layer foam has an ‘open cell’ structure, making it 30% more breathable than traditional memory foam or latex. The flippable Comfort layer has two sides of different foams, with their own unique comfort purpose.
A firmer foam, which provides whole body support throughout the night.
We’ve added a supportive foam encasement for edge support.
So you’re comfortable on every part of your bed, even the edges.
A strong foundation of twice heat-tempered steel pocket springs are separated into five zones to support your neck, back, shoulders, hips and legs optimally.
Keep your bed looking and feeling fresh with easy to wash covers.
Top layer fabric that’s designed to regulate temperature, so you can sleep in your sweet spot.
Our edge support foam is unique to other mattresses-in-a-box. So you’re especially comfortable wherever you roll.
How do I change firmness layers?
The Premium Adapt Mattress comes with Soft, Medium & Firm right out of the box. Changing layers is simple. You just need to unzip the top layer and rearrange the Comfort and Support layer as instructed in the

What kind of base can I use for the Premium Adapt Mattress?

With an additional foam layer, the Premium Adapt Mattress has a total of four foam layers to provide extra comfort and support. It also provides improved edge support through the addition of a foam encasement around the pocket spring base.

Lastly, the Premium Adapt Mattress also has a breathable and temperature-regulating top layer that is removable and machine washable.

How is Eva better than its counterparts?
Many online mattresses in the current mattress in a box market are foam only whilst ours is a hybrid, combining both foam and pocket springs. Our hybrid mattresses are a better choice in comparison to foam only mattresses, based on 4 factors.
: Pocket springs act as a great source of ventilation. The open structure allows air to circulate freely thus providing a cooler sleep. In contrast, a full block of foam acts as a barrier to ventilation and traps heat in it. This makes the mattress hot, especially during the Australian summer!
: Our pocket springs are built with reinforced steel around the perimeter of the mattress allowing you to use the full mattress. In contrast, foam only mattresses do not have any edge support. This prevents the full use of the mattress and might also result in falling off when sleeping near the edge of the bed.
: The 5 zone pocket spring supports the head and shoulder, back, hips, leg and feet. This relieves pressure points by varying the distribution of weight throughout the entire surface. Foam only mattresses are mainly made up of polyurethane foam and do not support different body zones like pocket springs do. Therefore, they do not accommodate different pressure points.
: Our pocket springs are heat tempered THREE times, ensuring that it is built to last. Foam gets softer over a period of time, therefore losing comfort and support in the long run.

How long until I can sleep on the Eva Comfort Classic Mattress?
The mattress will take about 48 hours to inflate to about 90% of its height. You'll be able to sleep on it within 3 hours of opening the mattress. Using the mattress during this time will not affect the inflation process in any way. In fact, regular use of the mattress will help it recover its shape more quickly.

              Eva Hemp Linen has all the qualities you love about flax linen, only it's better for the planet and more durable. Woven to 165 grams per square metre, your Hemp Linen will feel luxurious but remain breathable and trans-seasonal.
Hemp is mother-nature approved, requiring very little water and no ‘cides, synthetics or fertilisers. Known as the most durable of the natural fibres, our Hemp Linen Sheets will soften with age but never look worn — like a good bottle of wine that only gets better with time.
Thermoregulating sounds like a science experiment, but it really just means you will stay at your ideal body temperature while you rest; think warm in winter and cool in summer — just as it should be.
Hemp Linen comes in staple colours that suit every bedroom. Designed to mix and match, you can curate your dream colour palette. And they have a way of looking perfectly styled — even when you haven’t made the bed.
We believe that less is better. That’s why we created sheets that don’t need frequent washing or replacing. Hemp Linen is antibacterial and hypoallergenic so it’s gentle on the skin and stays fresh for longer.
No more guessing which side goes where. We've got you covered.
A concealed zip means less time spent makingthe bed.
Keep your duvet in place no matter how much you toss and turn.
Wondering how Hemp compares to Flax?
✔  Hemp is 6x more sustainable than flax and does not deplete the soil
✔  Hemp is stronger & able to withstand more wear and washing
✘ Flax uses more land than hemp for the same yield
How does Hemp compare to Bamboo?
✔ Both fabrics are soft to touch and highly breathable
✔ Hemp is far more durable than bamboo as a fabric
✘ Bamboo fabric relies on toxic and environmentally-damaging chemicals to be produced, hemp does not
How does Hemp compare to Cotton?
✔ Both fabrics are soft to touch and highly breathable
✔ Hemp is far more durable than bamboo as a fabric
✘ Bamboo fabric relies on toxic and environmentally-damaging chemicals to be produced, hemp does not
Behind the design: Our team share the journey to creating hemp linen
Hemp was first spun into fabric over 50,000 years ago and was popularised due to the hemp plants’ myriad uses. Hemp linen is extremely durable, deliciously soft and ideal for every climate. And on top of all its benefits in the bedroom, it is also one of the most sustainable fabrics available.
what is the difference between hemp linen and flax linen?
Flax linen and hemp linen have many similar properties in terms of breathability, feel and their antibacterial properties. When it comes to durability though, hemp is the clear winner being eight times stronger than flax linen. Therefore, hemp can withstand more wear and washing without being damaged, making it the most cost-effective option of the two. Bonus points go to hemp, which can produce 600% more fibre than flax when using the same amount of land and does not deplete the soil like flax. Therefore, hemp is the more sustainable choice when choosing between the two fibres.
 and benefits of upgrading to linen sheets. 
how long should my hemp sheets last?
Hemp is known as the most durable of the natural fibres, so with the right love and attention will be a part of your bedroom for years. To care for your sheets, ensure you wash them on a cold or warm setting only, line dry or tumble dry on a warm setting and do not bleach or soak.
The hemp plant is a renewable resource, needing very little water to grow (it can often rely on rainwater alone). Unlike cotton, which depletes the soil of nutrients, hemp improves the quality of the soil over time, returning 70% of nutrients to the earth. Hemp grows exceptionally fast — no matter the weather conditions — and is naturally insect and weed resistant, which means there is no need for pesticides, fertilisers or other chemicals.
