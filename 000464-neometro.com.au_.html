At home with Pete & Jude from 6 Brookville Road
For twenty years, baby boomers Pete & Jude Mahoney brought up their family in a sprawling Neometro designed family home in Melbourne’s Kew. With a firm relationship established and nurtured throughout the design and build of the family home, the Mahoney’s turned once again to Neometro when, finding themselves empty nesters, the notion of downsizing became more and more appealing.
The Mahoney’s purchased their Neometro apartment within the 6 Brookville Road development in Melbourne’s leafy Toorak, off the plan, in 2013. This presented wonderful opportunity to work harmoniously with the design team to make small amendments to the floor plan of their first floor, 2 bedroom apartment, ensuring the bespoke spatial arrangement was perfectly suited to the couples needs. Pete is an avid amateur cook and revelled in introducing small alterations to what is a beautifully seamless and integrated kitchen. 
Further through the apartment, a subtle alteration to the flow of the home was acheived by moving a single door, introducing a usability to the home that was specifically aligned to the Mahoney’s intention for their space to acheive a resonance rarely found in new builds. In fact, the entire apartment 5 years in has an uncluttered, airy appeal that is an homage to its clever design considerations and the opportunity to perfectly align to its inhabitants who have moulded it to fit their ultimate lifestyle.
When asked why they turned once again to Neometro for their new home, Jude explains in her endearing and no-nonsense manner that she knew she would like what they designed because of the level of trust and expectation established by living within the Neometro aesthetic for so long in Kew. After viewing similar small scale apartments in inner Melbourne (Airlie Bank Place  which was “too big” and Walsh Street “who wouldn’t love Walsh Street but it was also too big for us”) they were told of future plans for 6 Brookville Road. A quick drive through the location and they couldn’t deny its appeal. The ample green spaces and proximity to Malvern and Toorak Roads numerous amenities was perfectly suited to the couple who can walk to just about everywhere necessary to access their day to day needs.

meta title:Neometro – Our Approach
meta description:We understand that your home has a significant impact on your health and wellbeing. That’s why we strive to create homes that improve everyday life. Our buildings are the result of a unique and proven approach that unites architecture, interior design and construction with sustainable principles and respect for location.

We understand that your home has a significant impact on your health and wellbeing. That’s why we strive to create homes that improve everyday life. Our buildings are the result of a unique and proven approach that unites architecture, interior design and construction with sustainable principles and respect for location.
Design is fundamental to our work. More than just aesthetic, good residential design functions flawlessly, elevates its surroundings, and wears in, not out. Working with enduring materials, and collaborating with architects, interior designers and landscape architects against a rigorous briefing process, ensures our buildings are of the highest quality.
Where you live matters. We recognise the importance of the connection people form with their neighbourhood, local community and the home itself. Long-term happiness, security and support depend on a true sense of belonging—and the right location makes all the difference. When we plan projects, ensuring residents are connected to nature, transport, amenities and other people is essential.
For more than 30 years we’ve been refining our approach to building healthy buildings with our residents front of mind. In 2012, we developed the ethos of High Density Happiness—a concept driven by the potential positive impact of higher-density housing on physical and mental health. In the years since, this ethos has been codified into the Framework for Healthy Buildings, which drives every stage of project development.
Designated by six pillars, this evolving framework allows us to rethink and refine our approach to design features, spaces, amenities and services. Embracing the framework ensures our projects support the physical, psychological and social health of our residents, with great flow-on benefits to the community and our future cities.
Clean air within the home is fundamental to people’s health and longevity.
Pollutants generated indoors, such as volatile organic compounds, combustion by-products and airborne particulate matter, can lead to a variety of poor health outcomes—including chronic lung diseases.
Our homes prioritise design that maximises access to fresh air, ensures good ventilation, and minimises the use of harmful materials and substances in our homes.
Providing optimal air quality within our buildings helps to mitigate the harmful effects of pollutants, reduces the likelihood of occupants getting sick and promotes long-term wellbeing.
Regular exposure to sunlight is critical to physical and mental health.
When it comes to buildings, daylight should be the primary source of lighting—diffused and distributed evenly throughout interiors to avoid visual fatigue and physical discomfort.
Our homes prioritise design that maximises access to natural light for the benefit of residents’ long-term health—achieved through well placed windows that minimise glare and reduce the greenhouse effect.
Exposing residents to healthy amounts of natural light facilitates better sleep and enhances productivity.
The home should be a place of comfort, comprising spaces that foster good health and promote sustained physical and mental performance.
Buildings that strive to create healthy indoor environments take steps to reduce the most common sources of disruption, such as poor thermal quality, excessive noise and other sensory irritants.
Our homes are designed with passive heating and cooling strategies, and built with high-quality materials that insulate interiors and minimise external disruptions from adjacent homes or the street. We also have building policies that discourage excessively strong or distinct odours.
Collectively, these design strategies maximise comfort, improve sleep conditions, and help residents maintain mental and physical wellbeing.
A sense of belonging and connection to other people and community is essential to mental health.
Designed to encourage interaction, our buildings provide communal spaces that foster social wellbeing and help residents feel connected. Communal gardens, workspaces and open dining areas ensure it’s easy for people to come together, while the architecture and design create opportunities for spontaneous exchanges.
The quality of our homes and the benefits they provide compel people to live in them longer; neighbours may stay in the building for many years to come, further boosting the level of community that our buildings provide.
Given that mental health is a critical component of wellbeing, homes should have a positive impact on people’s mood and motivation.
Designed to foster wellness and support good physical and mental health, our interiors facilitate mindfulness and encourage mental decompression. Highly functional at their core, these spaces offer a sense of balance and proportion, punctuated by elements of visual complexity and varying scale.
Despite their urban settings, our homes strengthen connection with nature and amplify the restorative benefits we derive from being around living things. Alongside the landscaping and plant life weaved into Neometro homes, window placement is always considered for views to nature.
Given that physical surroundings can greatly impact people’s behaviour, homes should be designed to ensure their influence on residents is positive.
When planning new projects, we seek out locations that promote physical wellbeing. Sites are chosen for their connection to parklands, bike tracks, pedestrian walkways and public transport, alongside access to healthy and sustainable food options.
We also design our buildings to naturally encourage movement; including bicycle storage and workstations promotes physical activity, as does the placement of stairways throughout (elevators are included for those who need them, of course).
We want to redefine what sustainability means for property development. This means factoring in sustainability through the lifespan of the project and utilising best-practice passive design elements that harness solar energy, reduce dependence on artificial heating and cooling, and draw on recycled water. Through this approach we’re working to help ensure that housing meets people’s needs in the present without jeopardising the security of future generations.
When it comes to buying off-the-plan, it’s natural to have reservations. That’s why we foster an open, consumer-led process that encourages conversation and promotes an ongoing dialogue about what buyers want in a home. We want to hear from you and get a better understanding of your needs, so we can design buildings that work for you.
 is a great way for us to get to know you and discover what’s important to you. If you’re interested in living in a Neometro home, we warmly encourage you to complete the form. Once completed, we can notify you about future projects that meet your individual needs and align with your values.
If you’re interested in any of the homes we share with you, we’ll gladly arrange a time for you to speak with Andrew Steele, who heads up Sales and Customer Relations. He’ll take you through the finer points of the project and show you through the display suite at your convenience. You can also access our 
 to better understand the process and benefits of buying off the plan.
We want purchasers to be well informed and feel connected to the project during its development. Should you choose to buy a home off the plan, you’ll have immediate access to our Resident Portal, where you can keep track of project information, construction updates, resident events, and more.
During settlement, we’ll be there to assist you directly with this significant (and oftentimes stressful) change—and when it’s time to move in, we’ll be there to share in your excitement, holding an event to mark the occasion.
Once you’re settled in, we’ll check in regularly to ensure the home is meeting your expectations. Should any issues arise, we’ll address them promptly.

49 Walsh Street is our most significant project to date. Drawing on 35 years’ experience delivering architecturally-designed and socially-led developments in Melbourne, this building embodies the principles that have come to define that approach across decades. Crafted in collaboration with award-winning Italian architecture firm MORQ, the design centres on natural light, geometry and materiality—a relationship explored in great detail and depth to arrive at a building of uncompromising form.
Secluded, functional and connected to nature, the Ground Floor apartments look out to private courtyards with generous greenery. These elegant interiors will engage the senses, improve everyday life, and promote harmonious living. Apartments on the Ground Floor include two bedrooms, expansive kitchens and laundries finished to an unparalleled standard, outdoor cooking and dining areas, and private entrances.
Enveloped by a sprawling canopy of trees and bathed in dappled light, the Level 1 and 2 apartments are beautiful homes that effect a sense of everlasting tranquillity. Generous interiors are designed to elevate living and provide comfort over many years, with emphasis on natural light, tactile materiality and spatial flexibility. Apartments on Levels 1 and 2 include large main bedrooms, generous living spaces, butler’s kitchens and laundries of exceptional quality, outdoor cooking and dining areas, and dedicated entry halls.
The penthouse is the centrepiece of 49 Walsh Street, a unique dwelling that perfectly distils MORQ’s emotive approach to architecture. Reflecting the historic grandeur and sophistication that the Domain Precinct is known for, the penthouse is demarcated by three generous zones comprising a private suite with main bedroom, secluded guest rooms and flexible spaces, and grand living and dining areas. A large, private terrace borders the penthouse and looks out to a flourishing tree canopy, while the entrance is distinguished by a private lobby, lift and gallery space that leads into the home.
“We strive to design buildings that stand outside of time, untethered to any singular era, style or place. Buildings that get this right can’t be reduced to a movement, fashion or label. There’s a sense of restrained monumentality in their simplicity that feels eternal.” — Andrea Quagliola, MORQ.
Born in Rome and educated at the city’s La Sapienza University, MORQ co-founder Andrea Quagliola’s understanding of architecture and design was shaped by his environment. A city more than 28 centuries old, remnants of its ancient buildings can still be found today—their very existence a testament to the principles of good architecture. A strong bond with Rome’s historical fabric and appreciation of its enduring forms is evident in all of MORQ’s work. While their projects vary in scale and form, all reflect a distinctly European perspective applied to a modern Australian context.
Situated in the heart of the Domain Precinct, the Royal Botanic Gardens evoke a sense of calm and belonging that emanates well beyond their borders. Fundamental to the emotive quality of the gardens is the relationship between light and flora. The trees, with their generous canopies and sprawling forms, interact with sunlight in such a distinct and palpable way. They capture, distil, soften and diffuse it into their surroundings—in gestures both singular and effortless. This ephemeral connection between light and nature, demonstrated so beautifully within the Royal Botanic Gardens, is central to the design of 49 Walsh Street.
49 Walsh Street is situated in the leafy interior of the Domain Precinct alongside the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Tan, the Yarra River and the CBD. This charming area of the city is home to some of melbourne’s most historically significant architecture—beautiful, enduring buildings that improve day-to-day life through timeless, functional design. Through this collaboration with MORQ, we aim to contribute to this tradition with a building that resonates with its historic surroundings, designed and built to the highest possible standard and grounded in timeless principles that define good architecture.
49 Walsh Street, South Yarra is now selling with prices starting from $3.975m. To be kept informed and gain early access to the project, please fill in your details below:

Only 1 Apartment Remaining - North Facing Three Bedroom - Under Construction. 
A bold addition to Jewell Station Village, Nine Wilson Ave encapsulates our design-focused and socially driven approach to property development. Contextual and considered, the building focuses on making a neighbourhood at varying scales, prioritises sustainability and is engineered to last. As our fourth contribution to the area, the building plays a significant part in the urban renewal of this evolving Brunswick neighbourhood.
Upon completion Jewell Station Village will be a thriving part of Brunswick that connects to a range of amenities. With liveability being a focal point of the council’s streetscape transformation plan, emphasis is on easy access to Sydney Road and its many retailers, transport including trams, trains and bike paths, as well as parklands that promote better health.
Defined by the use of a singular colour, blush red, the design uses repetition, texture, depth and shadow to create a facade with a distinct identity. Through this lens of colour, the building has been considered at three scales: the urban village and street, the shared areas within the building and the private realm. At each scale, varying degrees of texture, detail and embellishment are used to enrich everyday moments.
When viewed from the street, the building’s paved entrance offers a glimpse to the central courtyard, rich with plantlife and accessible only by occupants. The design brings to mind buildings found in cities like Milan and Barcelona, where there’s a strong connection to the street and neighbourhood.
Once off the street, residents step into a central courtyard generously landscaped by Mud Office—a local landscape architecture studio known for their work on sustainable native gardens. Vibrant, drought-tolerant and robust, the greenery chosen is well suited to Melbourne’s varied climate. Landscaping will be irrigated with recycled rainwater to ensure it thrives throughout the year with minimal environmental impact.
Elevated walkways branch out from the central courtyard to create pedestrian streets and bridges that form the heart of the building’s inner neighbourhood. These shared spaces create opportunities to interact with neighbours when coming and going.
The building has been divided into quarters, which limits apartments sharing a point of entry to no more than four. Reminiscent of older apartment blocks, these inner foyers provide some concealment and separation from the central courtyard to ensure each front door feels intimate, private and secure.
Nine Wilson Ave is a series of 1–3 bedroom apartments and signature lofts. The interiors are designed to function well and provide comfort over many years, with emphasis on natural light, thermal efficiency and spatial flexibility. Both the design and material palette are guided by more than 30 years of testing and refinement to create apartments that work.
Generous volume and ample light are key to the quality and longevity of our spaces. When designing lofts, we find opportunities to provide high ceilings and dual aspects. Rather than follow trends, we focus on functionality, so that occupants can swiftly adapt the space to suit their varying needs. This flexible design approach means purchasers can buy once, buy well.
Nine Wilson Ave is a short walk or ride from both Princes’ Park and Royal Park. These large, sprawling parklands offer respite and calm, providing ample opportunity to maintain good mental and physical wellbeing.

As our first project with Edition Office, this building represents a new partnership founded on shared ideas and mutual respect. To learn more and access the early release, please register below.
Positioned alongside Victorian terraces, workers’ cottages and an established tree canopy, 450 Gore Street is in the heart of Fitzroy, between Brunswick Street and Smith Street. The building will offer sweeping, unobstructed views across the neighbouring inner-north suburbs and CBD.
Based in Collingwood, Melbourne, Edition Office is led by Aaron Roberts and Kim Bridgland. Celebrated for its experimental approach to architecture, the award-winning studio utilises cultural, social and technological research to uncover novel design processes that cleverly rearticulate the old.
Hawthorn House, completed in 2019 by Edition Office: a series of refined interiors enveloped by arched concrete shells. Initially conceived as a structural element, the facade evolved through the design process to become a focal point that dynamically connects the building’s interiors with the external environment.
Mary Street House, completed recently by Edition Office: a Federation-era bungalow defined by striking masonry elements that extend from the interior and intersect along the facade. Enduring materials including concrete, timber and recycled brick feature throughout.
Sculptural and geometric details, such as this balcony embellishment, ensure the building has a distinct identity. Subtle elements like these elevate the design without detracting from its beautiful simplicity.
Through strong focus on material expression and form, the building has a timeless design that complements its urban residential surroundings.
450 Gore Street, Fitzroy is Coming Soon. To be kept informed and gain early access to the project, please fill in your details below:

To learn more and access the early release, please register below.
In line with our approach to resident health and wellbeing, the site we chose is situated opposite Alma Park, which has ample green space for exercising and socialising outdoors.
St Kilda has long been an exemplar of high-density architecture, owing to its historically migrant demographic, largely from continental Europe. This project builds on that design legacy, which views high-density living as a choice rather than a compromise.
A shared garden runs along the east side of the block and opens onto a communal lawn shaded by an elm tree. The ample vegetation connects the building to the street and creates opportunities for residents to interact.
Each apartment will be distinguished by a unique element or feature—such as a bay window, sunroom or juliette balcony—to ensure it has an individual character that the occupant can connect with.
For over twenty-five years, Kerstin Thompson Architects have explored how architecture can respond to local conditions to positively shape lives and communities. If you’d like to learn more about KTA’s approach, we warmly encourage you to read the practice’s book,
