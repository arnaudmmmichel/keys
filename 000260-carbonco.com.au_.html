South Sulawesi Wind Farm in Indonesia
Provides clean energy to 70,000 households in rural Sulawesi, reducing emissions and employing 35 locals.
Electricity from Rice Husks in India
Provides clean energy and reduces waste by turning rice husks into electricity, while also supporting crucial social infrastructure.
Ceramic water filters provide clean drinking water, prevent waterborne diseases and reduce carbon emissions.
Generates affordable and reliable electricity for rural India, reducing emissions by over 690,000 tonnes per year.
Generates green hydroelectric power, reducing emissions by 25,500 tonnes and decreasing deforestation for wood fuel.
Plant trees in Australia & abroad
Can't choose an offset project? Trees combat deforestation, protect biodiversity & sequester carbon for years to come.
Carbon offsets (also known as carbon credits) are a powerful tool for individuals and businesses to become carbon neutral. By purchasing carbon credits from emissions reducing projects in Australia and abroad, your net environmental footprint is reduced while also supporting community development, environmental protection and much more.
We independently assess emission-reduction projects to ensure the maximum impact from your carbon offsets. Using academic research from the Stockholm Environment Institute (a leading independent research institute for sustainable development), we assess each project to ensure it is:
All offsets are certified under independent, international accreditation programs (Gold Standard and VERRA VCS).
All offsets have a positive social impact in addition to their environmental benefit (for example, poverty alleviation).
Offsets must enable an emission-reducing project to be commercially viable. If the project would proceed without revenue from carbon offsets, the offset does not have an additional benefit to the climate.
Offsets must accurately reflect one tonne of emissions reduced or removed from the atmosphere, be permanent emissions reductions, and be sold only once (not double counted).

About Us - Carbon Co .
We are a certified B Corporation – an organisation that has been independently assessed to meet the highest standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability.
Our goal is simple: to help you make a meaningful impact in climate action.
Carbon Co. is managed by small team in Sydney. We founded Carbon Co. based on years of personal experience running technology businesses that purchased large volumes of carbon offsets: as a customer of offsets, we realised that the carbon market was complex, misunderstood, but exceptionally powerful.
We set out to make the carbon offsets accessible to retail customers and small businesses. With an affordable subscription, you can now become fully carbon neutral. Unlike other players in the industry, Carbon Co. does not operate a ‘general fund’ that lacks transparency and accountability. Every Carbon Co. product states how many offsets you will receive.
We then carefully select the most effective emissions reduction projects worldwide, with our team (that is qualified in environmental science, law and finance) analysing projects before purchasing carbon credits on the global market on your behalf. We also partner with organisations around the world to plant trees and protect ecosystems.
Transparency, accountability and efficacy are our core values. Our carbon offsets support only projects independently verified under international carbon offset standards (such as VERA), and we publish regular reports on our projects.

meta title:FAQs - Carbon Co

We are a certified B Corporation – an organisation that has been independently assessed to meet the highest standards of social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability.
Trust, transparency and accountability are at the core of everything we do.
Unlike charities that operate with a general funding pool, our products and subscriptions clearly state the impact of your contribution. This is quantified either in terms of the number of tonnes of carbon dioxide that will be eliminated through verified carbon offsets, or the number of trees that will be planted.
You will receive a certification document for your offset or planted trees with a unique ID that can be used to verify your purchase.
For each carbon offset purchased, we procure an equivalent VERRA or Gold Standard accredited carbon offset on the global market. We’ll let you know what project your carbon offset has contributed to, and provide regular updates so you can keep track of your impact.
For each tree planted, we work with leading partners on the ground in each country and region. Our partners have the same values of accountability and transparency, and are regularly audited by both Carbon Co. and third parties to ensure that work is carried out to our high standards.
About 15% of our fees are used to cover the rest of our operating costs, such as boosting carbon awareness, product manufacturing, staffing and business costs.
We’re often asked how carbon offsets can be so affordable, and how our projects compare to other organisations that also provide offsets.
. Carbon offsets can be a murky world where it is difficult to ensure authenticity and on-the-ground impact. We therefore only procure carbon offsets that are internationally accredited and verified under standards such as VERRA and the Gold Standard. Anything less is not acceptable to us. You also receive a certification document with a unique ID, to help track your impact.
When procuring carbon offsets on the global market, we adopt a few strategies to ensure that we’re getting the best value:
– greenhouse gas emissions occur globally, and the effects of climate change are not constrained to national borders. There are limited carbon offsetting projects in Australia, so looking abroad often reduces our procurement costs. A solar project in a sunny part of the world that has cheaper land than Australia will result in lower carbon offset costs. We only consider internationally accredited projects to ensure maximum impact.
– as in almost any market, buying in bulk reduces our costs. Carbon offsets have a ‘wholesale’ price which we routinely purchase at or near.
Additionally, our costs are also lower due to our approach to profit taking, efficiency and expense management. Unlike some organisations with a large payroll and fancy offices, we adopt a minimalist approach that cuts our overhead expenditure. Our platform is built on automation and keeps our costs low.
Carbon Co. offsetting projects are selected on the basis of being:
 a project must be subject to independent inspections and carbon offsets must be verified under an international accreditation system, such as VERRA or the Gold Standard. This ensures that every 1 tonne of carbon offset through Carbon Co. contributions results in 1 tonne of carbon eliminated.
 going hand in hand with verification, a project must be able to measure its impact accurately.
we only fund projects that would not otherwise happen without funding from the carbon offset market. We do not fund projects that would have happened without carbon funding. This must be determined by an independent third party.
we only fund projects that are socially and environmentally responsible. This means projects that support their local community, do not have ‘leakage’ in the form of other negative environmental impacts, and comply with workplace and modern slavery laws.
We only purchase VERRA and Gold Standard certified offsets as these are independently verified against these factors, and many more.
