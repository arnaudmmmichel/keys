Faster and more accurate than a human tailor, Magic Fit® used advanced maths to make custom made easy.
Your height determines how long we make your Tee (obviously), but also sleeve length.
When combined with height and age your weight helps us predict body shape which can be qualified in the next step.
Your age qualifies weight because older bodies are different. Age is also statistically significant when calculating your waist, hip and bicep.
Your bra allows us to account for bust and is also statistically significant for predicting your hips.

100% Certified Organic Cotton 'Light' 110 GSM
Our lightweight organic cotton is grown and spun in India before being knitted in Melbourne at 110 gsm. Perfect for the Aussie summer it's ultra soft and naturally breathable with a luxurious drape as well as being Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified.
Please note we only offer dark colours in this fabric which are guaranteed opaque, because on lighter colours (inc. white) it can become semi-sheer.
100% Certified Organic Cotton 'Everyday' 145 GSM
Our 'everyday' organic cotton is grown and spun in India before being knitted in Melbourne at 145 gsm for the ultimate year-round weight.
It's incredibly soft, naturally breathable and washes like a dream as well as being Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified.
100% Certified Organic Cotton 'Heavy' 180 GSM
Our heavier organic cotton is grown and spun in India before being knitted in Melbourne at 180 gsm, perfect for winter layering.
With an amazingly soft handle and just as breathable as the 145 gsm, the extra weight provides more stability and durability as well as being Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified.
55% Hemp / 45% Organic Cotton
Hemp is the planet-friendly miracle fibre produced from the stem of the cannabis plant. Biodegradable and naturally organic requiring zero pesticides or herbicides, hemp also uses 50 percent less water than cotton.
With a visible texture similar to pure linen our 210 gsm weight is blended with organic cotton for softness to achieve the perfect balance between opacity, breathability and UV resistance making it ideal for the long hot Aussie summers.
Our 17.5 micron 'superfine' pure merino wool is single-origin sourced from happy sheep 300km west of Sydney before being knitted in Melbourne. How do we know they're happy? Because we exclusively buy certified cruelty-free 'non-mulesed' wool.
The extra-long staple ewe's fleece makes a 150 gsm cloth that is softer, smoother and more resistant to pilling than regular merino and feels like true luxury against the skin.

Try Magic Fit® today and make the switch to our Australian made, sustainable, and ethical T-shirts.
The most sustainable T-shirts in the world are also custom fit to your body. Yes really!
Distilled from over 196 million data points, Magic Fit® is your new tailor, replacing measuring tapes with algorithms.
All we need is your height, weight, age and bra to create a mathematical model of your body faster and more accurately than a human tailor ever could.

We only make what we sell and exclusively use natural fibres, so we produce 48% LESS carbon per Tee than fast fashion.
Plus we go a step further by carbon offsetting every single one of our Australian made T-shirts 5x to be truly carbon negative, and saving the forests of Tasmania in the process.

          Hallelujah, your Tees are now carbon 
UPDATE JAN 14, 2020: As a result of the Australian bushfire crisis we have pledged to 
5x our carbon offsets for 2020
proudly carbon negative and every single Tee made this year will sequester 11.6 kg CO2 in the forests of Tasmania.
“I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.” - Greta Thunberg
Greta’s words have never been more poignant here in Australia as bushfires rage across the country, 
 that makes Beijing look like the alpine meadow in the Sound of Music.
Look out the window and it's pretty bloody obvious that our house is not only metaphorically, but also very much actually, on fire. 
Time is fast running out to act
 on the climate crisis but no one in charge seems to be even the slightest bit worried.
And whilst we all have a personal responsibility to consume consciously, this is not a mess of our individual making. The only effective response to address the crisis of our generation will be bold government policy (
) mixed with sweeping change to the way business is done across every industry.
Carbon neutral is the next step in continuing to lead by example.
Business can either wait to have change imposed via legislation or instead we can take the lead and step into the vacuum left by our rudderless governments.
Here at Citizen Wolf we’re building the future of fashion and so we have a moral responsibility to lead by example and change the industry to be default sustainable. Our mission is nothing less than proving an alternative model to the take-make-waste paradigm is not only possible but also desirable and economically viable.
Our mission is nothing less than proving an alternative model to the take-make-waste paradigm is not only possible but also desirable and economically viable. 
We’re extremely proud of what we’ve accomplished so far in terms of sustainability and today we take the next logical step by making every single Tshirt produced in 2019 carbon neutral!
It’s our little Xmas present to all our amazing customers who have supported us throughout the year.
Think of carbon neutrality for your Tshirts like an over-the-air update for your Tesla (real or imaginary). Without doing anything and without costing anything extra, your Citizen Wolf Tshirt today is quantifiably better than it was yesterday. 
For clarity, carbon neutral doesn’t mean zero Carbon Dioxide (CO2) was emitted but rather that for every tonne of carbon that we created (aka the 'embodied carbon') we sequester the same amount to balance it out to ‘net zero emissions’.
Think of carbon neutrality for your Tshirts like an over-the-air update for your Tesla. 
We’ve audited our production process and calculated the embodied CO2 consumed in the production of every Tshirt this year to be ~30 tonnes which we’ve offset via the 
, a Tasmanian biodiversity project that aims to rewild 27,390 hectares of different forest back to high quality wildlife habitat, much of which had been previously used for commercial forestry.
To get a sense of just how much land that actually is, we've created a map of the equivalent area overlaid on our hometown of Sydney and it’s basically the entire central city from Bondi down to La Perouse, out to Padstow, up to Bankstown and The Olympic Park and back again to the CBD! 
Imagine all that space… as forest!
48% less CO2 than fast fashion.
A typical fast fashion Tee creates 5.6kg CO2 whereas a Citizen Wolf Tee creates only 2.9kg CO2 - equivalent to a 48% reduction!
In order to know how much carbon we needed to offset, we had to audit the CO2 consumption across every stage of creating your Tee - all the way from farm to hanger.
The impact can be broken down into five key stages which we’ve used to calculate a baseline following Peter Drucker the famous management consultant who said: "What gets measured, gets managed".
 (2005) on the carbon footprint of your average 100% Cotton Tee mass produced by any fast fashion brand, we’ve calculated the best approximation of the footprint of a Citizen Wolf 100% Organic Cotton Tee and put them side by side for comparison.
We'll release more detailed workings soon, but the short story is the 
 of a typical fast fashion cotton Tee is 5.6kg CO2 whereas a Citizen Wolf organic cotton Tee creates only 2.9kg CO2, equivalent to a 48% reduction!
"What gets measured, gets managed." - Peter Drucker
While this is a great result and validates our new and better way of making clothes, it’s also not good enough when over 
11,000 sedate scientists are telling us it’s time to panic
. Or as one particularly insightful 16 year old named Greta says: “I want you to act as you would in a crisis. I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.”
And that’s exactly why we’ve decided to become carbon neutral, because it’s the right thing to do for the only planet we’ve got. 
This is (still) just the start of our journey and we’ll be announcing a number of initiatives next year to make even more positive impact. Because now that we know where we stand we are able to also measure improvement over time. 
It won’t be easy, but the alternative of doing nothing is far, far worse.
There’s no shortage of dodgy examples around the world of carbon sequestration projects setup by cowboys with spurious benefits. So it was extremely important for us to choose a project that was verified to the highest international standards and one that we’d be proud to stand behind. 
The New Leaf project is in fact the only 
 accredited project in Australia and when it was setup in 2010 by the Tasmanian Land Conservancy (TLC), New Leaf was also the biggest private conservation deal in Australian history.

Citizen Wolf re-engineers the your way clothes are made at scale, to save our planet.
Fast fashion is like junk food – cheap but ultimately bad for you and also the planet. It’s a love-hate relationship built on exploitation and micro-trends you don't need and won't remember. But it doesn't have to be this way. Citizen Wolf exists to promote a healthier relationship with your clothes, built around our three core values:
We only make what we sell.
1/3 of all mass-produced clothing is sent to landfill, unsold. Every. Single. Year.
The most insane part of 'business as usual' fashion is the structural waste that's built into the model. Every mass-produced brand intentionally makes  ~30% more than they sell because accurate forecasting is impossible. Then, when these garments inevitably don't sell, they're sent to landfill to choke the only planet we've got.
No amount of organic cotton or recycled polyester gets around this fact. Which is why, despite the slick marketing campaigns, you simply cannot trust the sustainability messaging of any brand in the mass-production game.
By contrast, we only make what we sell here at Citizen Wolf – which is why we're fond of saying that the only sustainable clothes are made-to-order. Plus we recycled the hundreds of kgs of offcut fabric waste every month into our famous 
, instead sending it to landfill like other factories do.
We are proudly both B Corp and 
our staff are paid Aussie award wages (or better), plus we've 
voluntarily opted-in to the Modern Slavery Act
. Our merino wool jersey is also certified cruelty-free by the 
86% of our fabrics are made in Australia.
You know food miles? Well the exact same thing applies in fashion and it's not uncommon for the manufacturing process to touch 5 different countries (or more!), spewing unnecessary carbon in the process. This is clearly insane.
By contrast, we've built the shortest possible supply chain in the game and we're proud to be a part of the renaissance in Australian manufacturing. Almost all of our fabric is knitted in Melbourne and every Citizen Wolf garment is sewn in 
 – which is open to the public and doubles as our shop.

Made to measure with Magic Fit®
Faster and more accurate than a human tailor, Magic Fit® used advanced maths to make custom made easy.
Your height determines how long we make your Tee (obviously), but also sleeve length.
When combined with height and age your weight helps us predict body shape which can be qualified in the next step.
Your age qualifies weight because older bodies are different. Age is also statistically significant when calculating your waist, hip and bicep.
Your bra allows us to account for bust and is also statistically significant for predicting your hips.

100% Certified Organic Cotton 'Light' 110 GSM
Our lightweight organic cotton is grown and spun in India before being knitted in Melbourne at 110 gsm. Perfect for the Aussie summer it's ultra soft and naturally breathable with a luxurious drape as well as being Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified.
Please note we only offer dark colours in this fabric which are guaranteed opaque, because on lighter colours (inc. white) it can become semi-sheer.
100% Certified Organic Cotton 'Everyday' 145 GSM
Our 'everyday' organic cotton is grown and spun in India before being knitted in Melbourne at 145 gsm for the ultimate year-round weight.
It's incredibly soft, naturally breathable and washes like a dream as well as being Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified.
100% Certified Organic Cotton 'Heavy' 180 GSM
Our heavier organic cotton is grown and spun in India before being knitted in Melbourne at 180 gsm, perfect for winter layering.
With an amazingly soft handle and just as breathable as the 145 gsm, the extra weight provides more stability and durability as well as being Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) certified.
55% Hemp / 45% Organic Cotton
Hemp is the planet-friendly miracle fibre produced from the stem of the cannabis plant. Biodegradable and naturally organic requiring zero pesticides or herbicides, hemp also uses 50 percent less water than cotton.
With a visible texture similar to pure linen our 210 gsm weight is blended with organic cotton for softness to achieve the perfect balance between opacity, breathability and UV resistance making it ideal for the long hot Aussie summers.
Our 17.5 micron 'superfine' pure merino wool is single-origin sourced from happy sheep 300km west of Sydney before being knitted in Melbourne. How do we know they're happy? Because we exclusively buy certified cruelty-free 'non-mulesed' wool.
The extra-long staple ewe's fleece makes a 150 gsm cloth that is softer, smoother and more resistant to pilling than regular merino and feels like true luxury against the skin.
Six years ago we made our way into a fashion industry we had big plans to change. An industry which causes landfill crises all over the world while also being responsible for 8-10% of global carbon emissions. This was just not good enough and we were committed to re-engineering the way clothes are made at scale to be better for the planet, and better for you.
We began by creating the best possible Tee: ethically made in Sydney, using only natural fibres, and custom made to fit your body with our 
We were already going above and beyond anybody else in the industry by making to order and then we threw in 
, because it's the best outcome for the planet.
But being ahead of the pack hasn’t stopped us from pushing even harder.
We’ve always been zero-waste. Now we’re 100% circular.
"Waste isn’t waste until we waste it" - will.i.am
From Day One we’ve continuously evolved our production process to be more efficient; creating as little waste as possible. However, there’s just no getting around the fact that making things in the real world creates waste. But as will.i.am famously said, "waste isn’t waste until we waste it".
We’ve always had solutions in place to make sure nothing goes to landfill. At the beginning our fabric scraps were made into jewellery by a local artist. When she couldn’t make them fast enough, we started filling meditation cushions. Our next move was to create our very own 
 to upcycle any waste we do create into gorgeous accessories designed to last a lifetime.
As we’ve grown, we’ve needed to find bigger and better solutions to this problem and we could not be more excited about our next step…
"The circular economy is a systems solution framework that tackles global challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, waste, and pollution" - Ellen MacArthur Foundation
We’ve done everything humanly possible to make the most ethical and sustainable Tees on the planet. They’re all made to last and backed by free repairs for life so you can love them for years to come. But it is possible to lovingly wear your Magic Fit® Tee to death (sad as that may be), aka beyond repair.
At this point, the accepted next step is to throw the Tee away (or maybe turn it into a shoe polishing rag). After all, it’s done its job diligently, and all things must come to an end right? Not necessarily.
In the traditional linear economy, landfill is the accepted solution but in a circular economy, by contrast, landfill doesn’t exist, because there is no waste. Any product that reaches the end of its usable life is repurposed, recycled, or remade to ensure raw materials aren’t discarded.
We’re forever responsible for the Tees that we make, which is why we’re proudly going full circle by launching our very own take back scheme.
Introducing Our Take-Back Scheme: Where Your Next Tee is Made From Your Old Tees.
This is the circular future of fashion – it’s a win for the planet, and it’s a win for you. The best bit? It’s free.
We’re super proud to launch our very own take back scheme. We’ve made it easy to send that loved-to-death Tee back to us, so we can have it recycled and, eventually, turned into a new one.
Here’s how it works – we send you a prepaid satchel and you return it to us with your old Tee inside. Once your Tee is back at the factory, we’ll credit you the cost of the prepaid satchel so you can use it to replace the Tee you’ve sent back to us to be recycled. We’ll get busy shredding your old Tee to be made into new yarn, new fabric and a new Tee.
It’s a win for the planet, and it’s a win for you.
Our new recycled Tees are made from a 50/50 split of cotton recycled from old Tees and GOTS certified, virgin organic cotton. This means they’re soft, sturdy and long-lasting, all while treading even more lightly on the planet.
And yes, this is a pretty big deal.
We’re not just connecting you to a random textile recycling facility that will downcycle your Tee into insulation or rags for the local mechanic. We’re now guaranteeing that your old Citizen Wolf Tees will never, ever end up in  landfill by turning them into completely new Magic Fit® Tees.
This is the circular future of fashion we’ve been waiting for.
PS - Some brands call themselves ‘circular’ because they tell you to send your trashed clothes to be recycled somewhere else. Yet, all the while they continue to exacerbate throw away culture by making too much crap that no one needs. That’s not good enough, and it’s not a genuine commitment to eliminating fashion waste. 
We’re proudly doing our bit to ensure NOTHING we make ever goes to waste, and that everything stays in our Citizen Wolf loop, at every step of the supply chain. 
 Plenty of street parking so come and say hi!
We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land upon which we work, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation and pay our respects to their elders past, present and emerging.
All our clothes are proudly made with 💚 in Australia. Citizen Wolf® and Magic Fit® are registered trademarks of Citizen Wolf Pty. Ltd.

We started Citizen Wolf around the idea that 250 years after the Industrial Revolution created the fashion industry as we know it, there simply had to be a better way to make clothes at scale – better for customers, better for workers and better for the environment.
It’s been a long time coming but we are finally and very proudly now 
, humbled to join the ranks of 3,500 trailblazers globally such as 
 as well as our good friends 
In an industry like fashion where greenwashing is the norm and anyone can claim to be ‘sustainable’ because they use a bit of organic cotton, it’s incredibly easy to say you’re doing good but another thing entirely to prove it.
B Corp (short for B Corporation) is both a global movement and a framework to formalise using business as a force for good balancing people, planet and profit.
“B Corporation certification is the highest standard of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.” - B Lab
The proof is in pudding as they say, and whilst we always knew we were doing the ‘right’ thing, the extremely rigorous B Corp accreditation process allows us to benchmark ourselves against the very best ethical and sustainable businesses from over 70 countries around the world.
B Corp certification is a voluntary process for anyone wanting to hold themselves genuinely and transparently accountable for their business decisions, and the easiest way to understand how that’s different from a regular company is to know the distinction between shareholders and stakeholders. 
Limited liability companies have a legal, fiduciary duty to maximise returns for shareholders. This is what drives the stock market, quarterly earnings reports, and the myopic short term thinking that surrounds both. B Corps on the other hand, have a legal duty to consider all ‘stakeholders’ in any business decision.
"It's kinda like giving both Mother Earth and Mother Teresa a seat on your board along with your traditional investors and advisors" – Zoltan Csaki, Cofounder, Citizen Wolf
Investors are stakeholders (of course), but so are employees, customers and suppliers as well as the local community and the environment more broadly. It’s a much more complex and nuanced approach, with the ultimate goal of using business as a force for good rather than simply a profit-making machine for a tiny number of shareholders.
“What gets measured, gets managed” – Peter Drucker
The thing that distinguishes B Corp apart from other accreditations like Ethical Clothing Australia (
) is their multi-dimensional approach. Besides the stringent audit, B Corp requires businesses to demonstrate excellence in two or more of their five key pillars: governance, workers, community environment and customers.
“A business must demonstrate excellence in two or more of their five key pillars, you can’t just slap an organic cotton label on your t-shirts and call it a day.” – Eric Phu, Cofounder, Citizen Wolf
And it’s no walk in the park, with the comprehensive audit involving 200+ detailed questions on everything from breast feeding policies to waste water usage and even which milk is in the fridge (
In other words, you can’t just slap an organic cotton label on your Tees and call it a day. Afterall, can you really be a force for good if you save the planet by exploiting workers?
Companies receive an overall score across all 5 categories with a minimum of 80 points to qualify for B Corp certification. To put that into context, the average score for first-time applicants is 51 points, and the average B Corp has only 90 points. It’s extremely difficult on purpose and 
why we’re thrilled to have achieved over 100 points
“The spirit of B Corp is that we are continually working to improve and constantly benchmarking ourselves to do better - not just in one area, but across all areas of the business.” - Eric Phu, Cofounder, Citizen Wolf
Becoming a B Corp isn’t simply a check box for us, it’s about actively making sure that all our stakeholders are taken into consideration in any business decision to become the best corporate citizen as we possibly can be.
And if you agree that our wallets are a political tool insofar as every time we spend money we’re voting for the world we want, then please consider using the B Corp logo as a shortcut to trust you’re making a good decision – 
the full list of certified B Corps in Australia and New Zealand is here
Finally, thank you to every single one of our customers who have supported our mission to re-engineer the way clothes are made at scale, we could not do any of this without you!

" - Good Design Award Judging Panel
ashion is the second-most destructive business on earth behind oil, so c
leaning up the industry is critical to the planet. Yet the unspoken irony of most ‘sustainable’ fashion brands that still run a mass manufacturing model (which almost all do) is that they're plagued by the same structural issues of overproduction, inaccurate forecasting and landfill as the rest of the industry.
Even the greenest supply chain amounts to nothing when one in three pieces of clothing made go straight to landfill or are incinerated without being sold (
, though they’re not alone). Worse, a further one in three pieces are sold but end up in landfill anyway within only 12 months having fallen apart or simply fallen out of fashion.
Combined we send 66 billion garments into landfill every single year globally. Think about that mind boggling stat for a second.
Without addressing these systemic issues, ‘sustainable’ fashion is reduced to nothing more than greenwashing. 
The only viable solution to avoiding unnecessary landfill is making clothes on-demand only when they are needed, which is exactly 
why Good Design Australia have recognised Citizen Wolf as an innovator in sustainability
Custom fit to your body with 
Citizen Wolf’s gold award in the 2019 Fashion Impact category recognises our innovative on-demand manufacturing model and 
validates our ambition to prove a viable alternative to the mass production of clothing at scale.
Starting with T-shirts, Citizen Wolf rethinks the entire process of making clothes to be local, ethical and made-to-measure by default. Using magic not measuring tapes (aka algorithms) to automate the process of tailoring online, every Citizen Wolf Tee is made on-demand to fit the unique body of the customer in the most planet-friendly way possible. Each T-shirt is cut by laser and ethically sewn in their purpose built factory in St Peters (Sydney) with zero waste and 
Better yet, the process is incredibly easy and also fast. 
Choose your style and fabric and 
 instantly converts your height, weight and age (plus bra for women) into a bespoke pattern to fit your unique body. Your Tee is made and shipped within 10 days. 
 is 94% accurate and if the Tee isn’t perfect we offer 
The result is that our customers have an entirely different relationship with their Citizen Wolf Tees than the rest of their wardrobe. It’s a much deeper emotional connection - usually described as ‘love’ - and when you love something you wear it more often and repair it rather than throw it in the bin which is a very simple yet extremely powerful way to be kind to the planet.
The ultimate vision here at Citizen Wolf is to reboot the entire industry away from mass production towards on-demand manufacturing at scale for the casual clothes we wear everyday. Our proof of concept is T-shirts but our proprietary manufacturing system can make anything.

Our 17.5 micron 'superfine' pure merino wool is single-origin sourced from happy sheep 300km west of Sydney before being knitted in Melbourne. How do we know they're happy? Because we exclusively buy certified cruelty-free 'non-mulesed' wool.
The extra-long staple ewe's fleece makes a 150 gsm cloth that is softer, smoother and more resistant to pilling than regular merino and feels like true luxury against the skin.
It's been a looooong process, but this week we're absolutely thrilled to reaffirm our commitment to manufacturing locally in Australia in the most responsible way known to mankind – which is a convoluted way of saying that we've been re-certified by Ethical Clothing Australia!
Because buying from Australian manufacturers strengthens the local industry and importantly keeps your money in our domestic economy rather than sending it offshore mainly to 
the sixth richest bloke in the world
 means you can also shop guilt-free knowing the people who made your clothes have been paid fairly and are working under the right conditions – all too rare in the fashion game as you well know.
We implore you to spend some time with 
 to research other brands who are also doing the right thing – because together we can flip this dinosaur of an industry on its head and do a whole lot of good in the process.
To further reinforce our commitment to being about so much more than just profit, last year we 
voluntarily opted-in to the Modern Slavery Act
, with a long-term goal of identifying and abolishing slavery from our entire supply chain all the way back to the farms in India who grow our organic cotton and those in China who grow our hemp. 
This obviously won’t happen overnight but importantly it’s on the roadmap, because as the famous management consultant Peter Drucker said “What gets measured gets managed”.
 Plenty of street parking so come and say hi!
We acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land upon which we work, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation and pay our respects to their elders past, present and emerging.

Made to measure with Magic Fit®
Faster and more accurate than a human tailor, Magic Fit® used advanced maths to make custom made easy.
Your height determines how long we make your Tee (obviously), but also sleeve length.
When combined with height and age your weight helps us predict body shape which can be qualified in the next step.
Your age qualifies weight because older bodies are different. Age is also statistically significant when calculating your waist, hip and bicep.
Your bra allows us to account for bust and is also statistically significant for predicting your hips.
