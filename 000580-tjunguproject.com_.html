The Tjungu Project is a certified social enterprise and certified B Corp, built on the shared value model.
We exist to partner with First Nations peoples, to keep culture strong from one generation to the next. We do this by providing a sustainable supply of well-prepared guests for participation in cultural programs.
Through our partnerships with Traditional Owners, our experiences include a once in a lifetime, off-the-grid cultural and leadership experience in a regional Australian location for business leaders, executives and school students.
On this flagship journey, leaders can walk side-by-side with Traditional Owners to better understand and appreciate Aboriginal culture.
Our duty of care is to carefully select and prepare people to participate in a Tjungu experience.
For example, our guests understand before they travel that cultural activities like singing or dancing are not for guests' entertainment. They are forms of storytelling, a way of passing on knowledge to younger generations.
If we do our job well, a guest's experience can be life-changing.
You can find connection and learn from the oldest living culture in the world.
Silence, stillness and extraordinary country create the backdrop to think differently during a Tjungu experience.
On all of our journeys, you can discover previously unknown internal resources.
This is a cultural immersion multiplied by professional growth, overlaid with a social conscience.
Your program has been refined by years of cultural, development and growth experience and knowledge. Each program is tailored for the needs of the group participating.
Emphasis on looking at the past.
Emphasis on looking at the 'now'.
Painting your vision and dreams for tomorrow.
Making sense of what you've learnt.
1 on 1 and Group reflective sessions.
The Tjungu way is about being alongside your Indigenous counterparts listening and learning about their 80 thousand-year story, providing leadership lessons that go far beyond anything found in self-help or management books.
Our personal approach ensures each and every program we run is an incredible learning experience for you and your organisation.
The program starts well before you jump on Country. Before you depart we help participants prepare for their own experience, uncovering their own personal outcomes and building knowledge to ensure a culturally sensitive experience.
We have partnerships with homelands and communities in some of the most incredible places in Australia. Every region and Homeland has its own unique flavour and stories to tell, and every immersion is different.
You will be On Country for four to five days. This is where the magic happens, and connections and growth occur. The group will be welcomed by the community to share stories and culture... all totally tech-free (Sounds crazy right?! But we promise you probably won't want to turn your phone back on.)
When arriving back home, it's part of our responsibility to help you make sense of what you experienced and help your learning live on in your daily lives. Through reflection, storytelling activities and optional ongoing coaching, we'll give you the best chance.
The Tjungu learning program is carefully constructed to link each phase of the experience. Each participant will be required to conduct a number of self-reflections and activities that assist the learning outcomes. Optional organisational strategic 'off-site' sessions can also be included in the On Country experience.
Our carefully selected Leaders are responsible for the overall safety and facilitation of the program from start to finish. Our Leaders are real world educators. They work with each participant and the group to achieve the desired learning outcomes.
We arrange all trip logistics including flights, comprehensive insurance, risk assessments, medical kits and more. Your point of contact for travel logistics will be your dedicated Group Manager.
We want everyone involved in the Tjungu Project to have a life-changing experience without having to worry about their safety. The best way to take care of this is to anticipate problems rather than react to them. We work hard behind the scenes to make sure groups stay safe, so you can enjoy your experience with peace of mind.
Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the experience, expect to dot those i's and cross those t's. You will receive an email linking to a form including all the booking and deposit information.
Once your onboarding process is complete your journey begins. We begin by putting you front and center. Expect an email welcoming you to the Tjungu Project. The email will link you to a series of questions asking you to reflect on what you want from the experience. Your answers help us map out your learning profile.
Look out in the good ol fashioned letterbox. With about 4 weeks to go, we will send you a package with all your essentials; your journal, a couple of books and some gear etc. Cause we always need more gear. Look out in the pack for some handy instructions that will guide you in the lead-up.
The time and space to get together as a group set expectations and start our cultural education journey. This session will be delivered in person or online if needed.
Cultural activities, camping under a trillion stars, stillness and silence.
We help you continue your learning beyond the trip. We will arrange for the group to reunite and reflect. You will have access to optional coaching to help you implement your learning into your life - so you continue to do what matters with people that matter in alignment with your values.

Mitch grew up in Bo Peep, west of Ballarat, Victoria on Wadawurrung Country.
After finishing school Mitch spent ten years in an elite sporting environment, which taught him vital lessons about culture, resilience and leadership. Post career, Mitch was inspired to take these lessons he has learnt to the students he has had the privilege of working with over the last 5 years travelling the world. 
Creating opportunities for people to explore their authentic selves during their own life journey, learning life skills, connecting with one another and the world around them is Mitch's passion.

Shae believes in the power of business to make a difference.
Imagine a Venn diagram with 4 circles. In each circle sits an experience: investment manager, social enterprise executive, professional athlete, and entrepreneur. It is a combination of these experiences (both successes and failures) that help Shae bring a unique perspective.
The theme that links these different experiences is 'team'. Shae is obsessed with understanding what makes great teams great - whether that be in sport or business. Shae loves big visions and helping people and teams strive towards that vision. Shae loves empowering athletes and executives to do what matters when it matters in a values-based way to achieve high performance.
Kane grew up in Central Australia, with two of those years spent in Pukatja (Ernabella), situated in the heart of the Musgrave Ranges, just south of the NT border. Kane senses that things are coming full circle with the Tjungu Project, as he plays his part in pursuing its aims -- especially the goal of creating sustainable economic participation for Traditional Owners across the country. He can think of nothing better than his friend Joseph Tapaya, and Traditional Owners just like him, successfully running businesses that allow them to share culture, while also building financial independence.

We also had the opportunity to share our own stories and take the steps to deepen the connection within ourselves and with each other as we came together as a newly formed team. We reaffirmed our values and challenged them from a very different perspective. We were also taught some of the leadership lessons that have kept Anangu culture strong for all those years.
Such an experience is difficult to describe in words as it touched each of us on a very deep and special level. The generosity, warmth, trust and beautiful humanity in the way the family shared their proud story with us was both deeply humbling and inspiring.
Each of us now carry a profound respect and responsibility towards Aṉangu that will remain a precious part of each of us. There are no words in our language that can express the gratitude and the way our hearts, minds and souls were moved by our experience.
We completely 'switched off' all devices and disconnected from the outside world for the week so that we could fully immerse ourselves in this experience. We were able to learn about and connect with this sacred culture. We spent time on values, tradition, and storytelling.
As a HR professional, this was a lesson in real-life succession planning and the importance of intentionality when thinking about the culture you want to create and leave behind. I've returned home with an amazing sense of calm and am truly grateful for this experience.
Rita asked us to come prepared to listen with our heads and listen with our hearts, but not to take photos or write. She wanted us to learn about her culture, customs and tjukurpa (Anangu lore/stories dating back to the creation period when ancestral beings created the world) in the traditional way - through song, stories and dance. And for the stories to be told On Country where she could show us the songlines across the land. Rita and her family thought it was also a great opportunity to share the tjukurpa with their children and grandchildren, and allow them to also learn about their culture in the traditional way on their homelands.
Tjungu means coming together in pitjantjatjara, with the purpose of the project to bring different cultures together to learn from each other. But those on the trip from western backgrounds knew that we learnt more from the oldest continuous culture than they did from us. And we still have so much to learn.
We learnt about this sacred culture and how critical story telling is to inform future generations of these traditions and culture, we learnt about ourselves and we connected as a team. It is actually quite a challenge to sum up this experience in words.
I feel I left with a better understanding of this amazing culture, I left with a better sense of what really matters and I left with a renewed motivation to ensure I keep my story and our work story alive through story telling and the transfer of knowledge.
Director of Sales & Marketing, Royal Canin

"Words fail to capture the unique mark that the Tjungu Project has left on me. This journey has given me a deeper insight of our Indigenous culture and an authentic understanding of what connection to Country really means. Their strong values of sharing and taking everything as it comes has helped me identify what truly matters in life. After slowing down for 5 days and focusing on storytelling, I am inspired to go deeper, share my own stories and listen more. Personally, I am thinking more about the generations before me and the legacy I want to leave for my future generations. This experience will inform the way we continue the inclusive culture we share at Hickory and has instilled a new appreciation for our groups' mission to create better places for future communities."
Marketing & Digital Media Manager, Hickory
"the Tjungu Project gave me a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to start understanding Aboriginal culture and heritage unbiased from media. I enjoyed seeing the family's love and connection passed down from generation to generation. Listening to and being shown their stories was moving and gave me a different perspective on their culture and the journey they have been on.
I felt really disconnected from society and connected to Country; this gave me an opportunity to stop and reflect, challenge my life and put into perspective areas I can improve on and share with others."

Caring for Country | Tjungu Project

No matter where you are in Australia, and no matter whether you and your family have been in Australia for five minutes, five years, five decades or across multiple generations, what unites us all is that we are all standing on Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander Land. 
 suggest that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have lived sustainably with the Land for more than 120,000 years, and the continued imperative to care for Country/place is part of our shared history and needs to be learned and understood more broadly. 
, it is important for all members of the community to develop meaningful connections with and to care for the Country/place on which they stand.
It is important for the entire Tjungu Project family to actively connect with, and care for, the Country/place on which our operations stand. Doing so involves respectfully learning about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives, philosophies and practices about caring for Country/place, as well as physically demonstrating respect for the Lands, skies and waterways where living and learning occur. It is also important to consider First Nations perspectives as part of broader sustainability plans, policies and practices. This will reinforce the meaningful and continuous connections that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have had with Country/place since time immemorial, as well as provide positive opportunities for all members of the Tjungu Project to become socially and environmentally responsible citizens who display a growing awareness of the importance of First Nations land management and sustainability.
As a starting place, opportunities should be afforded to all Tjungu Project participants to reflect on, and develop, their personal sense of connection to the skies, waterways and lands on which they live and learn. While fostering such opportunities, participants should also focus on developing an understanding and respect for the deep, longstanding and continually important connections between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and Country/place. The relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and Country/place is considered sacred, and is simultaneously interconnected with identity, family/kinship, traditions, languages, cultures, and physical, spiritual and socio-emotional well-being. By appropriately drawing on local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content and perspectives pertaining to 
 and sustainability, as well as to 
, plants and animals of significance, participants will learn the importance of caring for Country/place first-hand and in culturally appropriate and meaningful ways for each respective area in which their program sits. By building awareness of the impact humans have on the environment, all Tjungu Project participants learn how to play a role in positively living with, rather than imposing on, the Land. 
The Tjungu Project recognises the importance of collaborating with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples when considering learning about the local environment.
The Tjungu Project aims to contribute to preserving natural and built environments in the destinations we visit and to reduce the negative impacts our operations may have on the environment. We do this by minimising the use of resources (energy, water, waste) and reducing our carbon emissions in our offices, on our programs and in the destinations we visit.
• Implementing energy conservation initiatives (such as more efficient lighting/equipment).
• Ensuring better waste management by using ‘avoid, reuse, reduce, recycle principles.
• Adopting better purchasing practices (e.g. sourcing products with post-consumer recycled content).
• Implementing water-saving initiatives to reduce consumption.
• Encourage the use of public transport, carpooling, and biking to work. 
• Limiting corporate travel anytime possible.
• Employees are encouraged to use virtual meeting technology to reduce in-person meetings.
• Using local transport where safe, reliable and feasible, and when this is not feasible, using private, locally owned transport.
• Ensuring our vehicles/fleets are well maintained and fuel-efficient.
• Encouraging travellers to minimise their waste and water usage on the trip.
• Encouraging our suppliers to adopt more sustainable practices or choosing suppliers who already have greener practices in place.
• Eating at local eateries (limiting food km).
• Shopping at local markets offering local produce, items, souvenirs etc.
• Understanding the environmental issues in destinations and minimising our direct impact (eg. if there’s a local deforestation issue, we’ll avoid purchasing and using firewood for a campfire).
• Ensuring our passengers preserve and do not contaminate the local water supply.
• Observing all national and marine park visitor rules.
• Using a ‘take in, take back out’ system of waste management in remote regions and national parks.
• Using established or existing tracks and paths.
• Minimising the use of intrusive devices (such as lights) and keeping noise to a minimum at culturally significant sites and other sensitive places.
• Discouraging travellers from touching fragile environments (e.g. rocks or formations in caves).
We will address our impacts on the environment through the development of an Environmental Management System (EMS) that meets the requirements of the international standard AS/NZS ISO 14001.
We will set objectives and targets and review them annually in order to improve our environmental performance and will regularly assess the environmental impacts of our operations.
