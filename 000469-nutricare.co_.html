Definitely will but again, love all patch products
This is the only bandaid I've ever used that caused absolutely no reaction! Over the years I think I've tried every brand, even those latex free, hypoallergenic ones; I have had no reaction at all, no redness, no blisters, nothing. It so nice.
 PATCH VALUE PACK - 100 Natural Bamboo Bandages 
I love the first aid kit. Has so much in there and all I needed to add was an antiseptic.
These are hardy adhesive bandages. They have great stick, as well easy release, stylish and practical packaging.
 PATCH VALUE PACK - 100 Panda Bamboo Bandages 
I'm so glad I found PATCH bandaids. 'Normal' bandaids pull my skin off when I  remove them, but PATCH are the gentlest but strongest ones ever
 PATCH MIXED PACK - 100 Assorted Size Bandages 
Haven't used any yet, but looking forward to it.  I work with kids and there is always a need for bandaids - school first aid kits NEVER have enough, so now I have it covered.  So cute and quirky that even my year 12 students will love them.
The order was promptly delivered. We have used then and served the purpose since there weren’t any allergic reactions
 PATCH MIXED PACK - 100 Assorted Size Bandages 
I can’t use regular bandages - they make me break out. These are wonderful - stay on and no reaction!
This is a must have for every household! The best plasters on the market and in a handy pack with a size for every need.
 PATCH MIXED PACK - 100 Assorted Size Bandages 
Thankyou for a true compostable Band-Aid - it also heals wounds quickly
I love these Panda Bandages! I get them for myself as they are just too cute :) I only buy Patch bandages now as they don’t leave red marks on my skin and they don’t rip your skin off when you remove them. I also love that they are sustainably sourced and cruelty free. The best bandages around, in my opinion!
Very handy to have for my sensitive skin post surgery

 PATCH VALUE PACK - 100 Panda Bamboo Bandages 
I have very thin skin, and I tend to bounce off everything (walls, golf clubs, you get the idea). These are the only bandaids I have found that stay on AND don't damage my skin to remove.  This is especially important as my injuries take weeks or months to heal. Thank you SO MUCH!

We set out on a mission to find out.
While it can be pretty easy to swap things like straws, coffee cups and plastic cutlery for sustainable alternatives, 
For many years our customers have built their own 
s using our PATCH bamboo strips, but other components were often much harder if not impossible to find as an eco-alternative. We knew we had to work hard to find better solutions.
We have spent over a year refining our new Eco 
 to ensure that all the components inside were sustainable. We have found solutions for plastic free cotton buds, gauze pads and we have included a range of different sizes of our PATCH bamboo bandages such as strips, dots, squares and rectangles - everything you need to patch up life's little accidents. 
Packaged together in a convenient refillable tin, you can pop in the cupboard for when you need it. We know it is important to always have an emergency stash of 
 supplies and you can feel good knowing that your 
 is full of safe and conscious wound care solutions.
Here's what we've put inside our kit
5 x PATCH Aloe Vera Eco Bandage Strips 
5 x PATCH Charcoal Eco Bandage Strips 
5 x PATCH Natural Eco Bandage Strips 
5 x PATCH Coconut Oil Eco Bandage Strips 
2 x PATCH Natural Large Square Bandages 
2 x PATCH Aloe Large Rectangle Bandages 
5 x PATCH Natural Eco Dot Bandages 
2 x PATCH Charcoal Gauze Pads 
1 x PATCH Cohesive Wrap Bandage
