Active participants in the following communities
We help our clients work toward the UN SDGs
INCREASING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH & WELLBEING TOOLS FOR WHOLE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES
Grow Your Mind, a certified B Corp mental health social venture, wanted to scale. An initial 3 month project in 2020 has evolved into an ongoing partnership covering growth strategy, strategic roadmapping, leadership support and accountability, major partnership introductions and negotiations, support through the Scaling Impact Accelerator and funding through Boosting Female Founders and Impact Investing Australiaâs Growth Grant.
Working with the Impact Investing Australia Growth Grant, we designed and delivered an Impact Measurement Framework, including Theory of Change, Logic Model and Data Measurement and Measurement Plan.
ENABLING THE CELEBRATION OF DIVERSE FIRST NATIONS CULTURES IN INNER SYDNEY
We partnered with multinational Atelier Ace to develop a Social Impact Strategy for the new Ace Hotel Sydney. Focused on First Nations Storytelling and culturally-led by Nina Fitzgerald, the strategy designed a range of interventions through the property to communicate the diversity of First Nations voices in inner Sydney, including an Artist in Residence, commissioned Acknowledgement of Country, Partnerships and Collaborations.
INCREASING TRUTH TELLING, ENCOURAGING CONVERSATIONS & UNITING PEOPLE THROUGH FASHION
Clothing the Gaps needed support with their Strategic Roadmap. Through a series of workshops over 6 weeks we helped align their Key Strategic Initiatives, Impact Goals, Theory of Change and Logic Models with an annual plan with clearly defined quarterly goals.
We were engaged by a private venture capital firm for an independent growth assessment of an organisation under review for their portfolio. A comprehensive growth, opportunity and organisational report was delivered to the investment committee to assist with their decision making.
SUPPORTING CONSERVATION, ADVENTURE and COMMUNITY BY CAPTURING THE ESSENCE AND SPIRIT OF AUSTRALIA
Australian Geographic were launching an ecommerce platform and needed a detailed business case, financial model, team structure and profitability plan to present to key stakeholders. A one-day workshop with us resulted in the project being approved.
