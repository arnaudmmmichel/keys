Being a design & building company means we can work with you through the entire journey of creating your new home – from concept development to handing over the keys.
When you work with The Sociable Weaver to create your dream home, there are two options.
Option One: You can work with our in-house architects to design your own custom home.
Or, Option Two: You can pick one of our existing designs as a starting point and we can work with you to make it just right for you and your family.
The Sociable Weaver homes are architecturally designed and utilise innovative passive solar to create energy efficiency all year round, resulting in reduced power bills and carbon emissions. We place great emphasis on clever design principles that interact with the environment, use natural and recycled materials, and reflect sustainable building practices within the community.
Creating a custom home with The Sociable Weaver will see you working closely with one of our designers to illuminate your aspirations for the space, we’ll spend time getting to know you and developing a deep understanding of how you live in your home. You can expect a collaborative process through all three stages: concept designs, town planning and construction documentation. Once you’re happy with the design it’s time to start the build and we’ll handover internally to our construction team.
Over time, we’ve designed a number of sustainably focused, malleable home designs that can be tailored to suit your needs. Starting with one of the designs featured here, we’ll work with you to have the design drafted up ready for building permit application, and we’ll put together a specification and prepare the construction contract. Once the design is ready to go, we’ll hand over internally to our construction team.
Our vision is for all Sociable Weaver homes to be carbon positive. And by leading the way, we strive to educate the industry on carbon positive building, with the vision of all new homes, industry-wide, being carbon positive by 2050.
Currently, over 90% of our construction waste is recycled with a goal to recycle 100% of our construction waste by 2020. We live on and in a closed ecological system called planet Earth, where all waste from one process becomes food for another.
By planting at least 300 trees for every project we are helping restore natural ecosystems and regenerating the timber we use for our buildings on site. The Sociable Weaver team believe in giving back to the Earth, not just taking from her. We ensure that the trees for each project are planted in a suitable habitat and encourage our clients to join us for tree planting events.
To protect and preserve the coastlines our staff and clients enjoy, we remove at least 300 kilograms of coastal pollution from Australian beaches every year. We work with 
 to run beach clean ups and invite our clients to join us. All waste removed is recorded for the Australian Marine Debris Initiative, assisting efforts to develop source reduction policies and initiatives.

Across the semi-arid plains of Southern Africa, some of the most spectacular structures ever built by a bird are perched on top of trees and power lines. These carefully constructed nests reach heights of up to four metres, with as many as four or five hundred birds inhabiting them at one time. Woven together with twigs, stems, sticks and dried grasses, they feature interconnected spaces that allow the inhabitants to both socialise and enjoy solitude within the bird community. Nesting several generations at a time, these nests withstand the extreme African weather to exist for hundreds of years.
These resilient, high-density communities are built to belong by the incredibly intelligent bird – the Sociable Weaver.
Inspired by this small bird, we too work with the natural world, building homes and structures that are regenerative and inspiring. Homes that foster a sense of belonging for everyone who inhabits the space. We are not only interested in creating homes; we are interested in creating a new way of being — one that inspires a richer, more meaningful experience for the inhabitant, and has a positive impact on the world we live.
Environmental responsibility informs every decision we make from our building materials to our building processes. This isn’t just about positively impacting the planet and increasing energy efficiency in our homes, it’s about connecting residents to nature, awakening their senses, and promoting a healthier, more balanced state of mind and wellbeing.
We’re interested in creating homes and streetscapes that open people up to one another, that cultivate meaningful relationships while still allowing residents to find the solitude they need in their daily lives. Like the nests built by the Sociable Weaver, our homes foster a sense of belonging — connecting residents to their environment, their community and ultimately, to themselves.
We believe beauty and the aesthetic world play a powerful role in igniting the human spirit and inspiring us to action. When created well, spaces should captivate and move us, maybe even change our heartbeat. That’s what we aspire to do – to create beautiful homes, upholding craftsmanship that stands the test of time.
Certified Passive House Designers and Builders
‘Passive House’, or passivhaus as it is known in German, is a design standard that delivers healthy, comfortable and efficient buildings.
A Passive House takes a ‘fabric first’ approach. The focus of the design is ensuring the thermal envelope (the layer that separates inside from outside) is optimised to provide comfortable, healthy, indoor conditions. As Australian homes are becoming increasingly well insulated and airtight, using Passive House as an integrated, physics-based approach to ensures buildings perform as predicted and avoid air quality and mould problems.
The Sociable Weaver holds both Design and Construction certifications to be able to design and construct certified Passive Houses.
The Sociable Weaver is a design and building company that creates healthy, sustainable, community minded, functional homes. Our thoughtfully designed houses encourage connection to nature, to community, to family, to friends and to ourselves. In 2019 we became a certified B Corporation which means that we meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Corps form a community of leaders and drive a global movement of people using business as a force for good.
The Sociable Weaver homes are each designed to a minimum 7 Star energy rating. Our intention is for all of our homes to be carbon neutral or carbon positive and where possible we love to take things completely off-grid. We design our homes to outlast a lifetime, focusing on making them practical, economical and available at a price point that makes  architecturally designed, functional, healthy and environmentally conscious homes accessible to more buyers. We are a B Corp Certified business, certified Passive House builders and certified Master Green Builders. We strive for zero waste construction sites and to run our business and sites free from single use plastics.
We understand the construction industry uses many resources, so it is our mission to restore natural eco-systems and regenerate the timber we use for our builds. To do so, we have committed to planting 300 Trees for each of our projects. By doing this we restart the natural cycle and ensure we are giving back to our planet. We call it our 300 Tree Initiative.
Beyond the design of your home we place a strong emphasis on what life will be like inside. We do this by considering factors like building biology, Feng Shui design principles, permaculture integration, recycling processes, accessibility and more to ensure you can live your healthiest life in your new home.
The Sociable Weaver is one part of our vision for transforming the built environment for the better. Our award-winning construction company, 
, is the core builder of many of our projects. If you would like to work with us as builders alone, please get in touch at info@martinbuilders.com.au.
To transform the built environment on a larger scale, we enact our vision for positive development through
