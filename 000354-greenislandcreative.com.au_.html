Our Work — Green Island Creative.
Brand Storytelling Workshops for Local Farms
 to engage local farms, and help them build and communicate their brand through storytelling. In this brand storytelling workshop, we gave an introduction to brand theory, customer profiling, behaviour, and ‘setting the scene’. Participants then worked through concept ideation and story crafting exercises to come up with their own original texts. Workshops have been held in Milton and Braidwood, with another upcoming in Gerroa - as well as two more ‘Intro to Permaculture’ workshops with Jimmy.
We created a brand, style guide and website for 
, the industry-leading software and technology company that is improving regenerative ocean farm operations around the world. Formerly ‘Smart Oysters’, we worked with Oceanfarmr to transition their brand and existing customers, develop pitch decks for investors, and attract a new audience to the app. 
We have worked extensively with the

education program. Since 2020, we have designed and coordinated activations and events for this MSC initiative, including Sustainable Seafood Week, National Science Week, World Ocean Day, and Christmas celebrations. We have also launched a set of First Nations themed resources for Australians teachers to meet cross-curriculum objectives and teach students about traditional approaches to and methods of sustainable fishing.

Brand Storytelling Workshops — Green Island Creative.
To run a brand storytelling workshop for local farms
In collaboration with South East Local Land Services, we ran our first brand storytelling workshop for small producers at 
 in Milton. Participants represented regenerative farming, eco-tourism, truffle farming, garlic farming and dairy NSW. 
The workshop content was split into two parts: brand communications theory and brand storytelling. The content was designed around a learn-by-doing scenario, with exercises to develop customer profiles, ‘set the scene’, and craft the elements of a story. Participants produced some beautiful, tear-jerking, and top quality brand narratives.
We subsequently hosted our second and third workshops in Braidwood with the Local Land Services (attendees from 9 local farms) and community organisers at Landcare NSW. In the Landcare workshop, community leaders learned how to story-tell their works and events, and recruit volunteers.
We will be hosting our third Brand Storytelling workshop with the LLS in Gerroa in May 2023.
As part of the workshop, participants were offered a free one-hour follow-up session to further discuss their individual farms. All participants attended their follow-up sessions, and we have continued on with some farms to develop their visual brands and websites - using stories they have crafted themselves!

Branding for a B&B — Green Island Creative.
 Whispering Woods & Pemberton Honey Company
Create a sister brand and website for the new beekeeping business that is ready for launch into the global market of high-quality Australian honey
We created a brand for Whispering Woods, a farm, B&B and wedding venue in Pemberton WA, in 2016. The client came to us hoping to extend on the success of their existing brand using its aesthetic to create a visual style for their newly acquired honey business. We were excited to help and got to work researching global honey markets, brands and understanding the environmental importance of the honey industry in Australia and around the world. We loved working with this company and Whispering Woods as they aim to incorporate sustainability and low-impact practices at all times as if it was second nature.
Considering the multicultural market, we incorporated recognisable symbology that reflected the landscape; the towering Karri forests that the Pemberton region is famous for and the hexagonal honeycomb combined. We used a deep brown and rich honey colour scheme captured from photographic reference from the beehives and product itself and wove this into an approachable looking website 
A boutique honey brand for the local and international market.
