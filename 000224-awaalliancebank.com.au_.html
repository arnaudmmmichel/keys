As part of our ongoing efforts to ensure the safety and security of your accounts AWA Alliance Bank has implemented a stronger password policy for your internet banking access.
AWA Alliance Bank’s stronger password policy requires Members to ensure their passwords are a minimum of 8 characters with a maximum of 39 characters.
The stronger and longer your password is, the better!  
Your strengthened password will need to have characters from 3 of the following 4 groups:
Punctuation marks, mathematical and other conventional symbols.
NOTE: Passwords can include any characters except for the following: ` ^ & < >
Below your password you will be prompted to enter text from an image provided that will be a combination of letters and numbers. This second factor authentication process is called CAPTCHA and adds an additional layer of security to the login process.  
In addition to stronger passwords and the CAPTCHA process all Members are required to have the SMS One Time Password (OTP) functionality activated in order to use internet banking.
OTP works by sending a unique access code to your mobile device which needs to be input when prompted, including at login.
If you don’t have a mobile phone number registered to your account, you will need to add one before access to internet banking can be enabled. Please call 1300 056 953 or visit your local branch to have it added.  
AWA Alliance Bank urges our Members never to share sensitive banking details, including password or PIN. We will never ask you for these details, or to transfer money, download software or login via a link sent through email or SMS.
