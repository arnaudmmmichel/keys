Find out more about working with MindArc
When it comes to eCommerce websites, good design is more than how it looks like. MindArc understands the anatomy of good design—that it also includes easy-to-navigate layouts, clear information delivery, effective brand building, seamless user experience and more—and how to implement it on your website.
Aside from beautiful design, we ensure every page is optimised across every channel and device to provide a seamless and responsive web browsing experience. Our eCommerce web design team works at all levels, whether wireframes and mockups to prototypes and test prototypes in different devices.
Why is UI/UX Important to eCommer
User Interface or UI focuses more on how the online storefront looks in the eyes of the customer. Having a stylish and on brand website design with high-quality images helps attract eyeballs and glue them to the screen as they like what they see. User Experience or UX, on the other hand, is more on the whole experience of the user from first interaction up to leaving the website. It focuses more on creating solutions to customer pain points, giving them a product that is both delightful and easy to navigate.
Online shopping is a journey; it's the same as walking around a brick and mortar store and looking for items to buy. From entering the website to purchase, customers can easily drop out of this journey anytime as long as you give them a reason to, including bad design, incomplete product information and low quality images
MindArc fully understands that UI and UX work together, building products that are human centred, easy to navigate and visually stunning.
What Makes MindArc the Best Web Design Agency?
MindArc is an award-winning eCommerce web design company in Sydney
and also recognised as an Official Shopify Experts and Shopify Plus partner. When it comes to designing websites, our UI/UX web designers always consider everything from your brand.
