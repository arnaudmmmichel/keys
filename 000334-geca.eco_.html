GECA has helped countless Australian businesses obtain certification
What our clients say about us
The entire everroll range of rubber flooring is certified under the Good Environmental Choice Australia (GECA) Floor Covering Standard. It achieves a Level A 100 per cent item score in the GBCA Fitout Calculators Guide v1 for Flooring. We chose to become GECA certified because we feel that it is important to communicate to consumers that we take environmental responsibility seriously and GECA helps us do this. As well as its sustainable properties, everroll offers architects and designers other benefits including durability, sound absorption, slip resistance, modular designs, aesthetic appeal and comfort.
Fitting out such a large project with sustainably preferable furniture is rewarding. That a well-renowned and international company would choose to use GECA certified Office Link Group furniture is exciting and without doubt, a step in the right direction for improving sustainability in the workplace.
The whole work zone looks great — the architect has done a wonderful job of creating the space. With the addition of the sustainably preferable products that are proven to improve the health and wellbeing of those in the workspace, it is now a really nice place to work.
Clients say it’s GECA or nothing.
If you don’t have GECA certification it’s a negative.
GECA certification is a priority for Haworth.
Being an environmentally aware business, we needed a way to ensure, adhere and implement sustainably preferable strategies into our business plan.
The team at GECA is co-operative and their guidance ensured that we not only complied with green standards, but exceeded them.
The process is credible and well-received in the market place
and ensures that we are set apart from the not-so-genuine ‘greenwashing’ companies.
