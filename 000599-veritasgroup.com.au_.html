There is an ever-increasing need for employers and employees alike to ensure that trade qualifications and certifications are relevant and current before commencing hazardous tasks. Because certifications expire at different intervals, the management of individual workers' credentials can prove a daunting task.

Synthesizing large amounts of data to support decision making is both an art and a science. When analysing data that is of a safety critical nature, verifying and validating the use of appropriate models is of principal concern.
Through the development of tools to automate the capture and analysis of critical safety related data, combined with the implementation of training and raising of awareness levels, Veritas Group delivered significant safety related outcomes to Western Power.
        Veritas Group delivered improvements to the organisation strategy and approach to incident reduction, particularly in the areas of problem identification (through formal root cause analysis), solution development (through active engagement of personnel), and program management (via defined and measurable objectives).
Worsley Alumina was in the process of building a multi-fuel cogeneration power station when there was a

At the time of developing Veritas Check we investigated the existing solutions available for
        obtaining Police Checks issued by the Australian Federal Police. We found that the industry was plagued with
        unduly complicated application processes that were cumbersome and slow.
The same is true for persons requiring Australian Federal Police (AFP) Police Checks for immigration or
        citizenship purposes. Many of these applicants are based or reside overseas and therefore needed a convenient

For applicants, particularly those based overseas, Veritas Group delivers an easy to use and convenient tool to help these people see for themselves how great a land Australia is.
Finding a solution for the ASIC and MSIC legislation changes
On November 2016, the Australian Government introduced new legislation for the ASIC and MSIC schemes. The new legislation
        requires an applicant who is applying for an ASIC or MSIC card to have their identity verified by a White ASIC or
        MSIC holder. Before these changes were introduced, the person verifying an applicant's identity was not required
        to hold an ASIC or MSIC themselves. These new changes tightened the security in the ASIC and MSIC schemes.
In order to comply with new legislation changes by 1 August 2017, Veritas and Australia Post collaborated
        design a simple, user-focused ASIC and MSIC application process.
To apply for an ASIC or MSIC, an applicant completes an application on Veritas' website (ASIC: 
        submitted, Australia Post receives the applicant's data for an in-person interview. The applicant visits
        Australia Post for their identity check and the interview data is forwarded to Veritas. To make the application
        process accessible nation-wide, Australia Post made sure at least two staff in selected post offices around
        Australia were able to conduct identity verification.  Once the interview has been conducted, Veritas processes
        the application with the government body. Background check approvals are generally received within 2 - 3 weeks.

Australia's largest MSIC Card provider - Veritas Group
In 2006, the Australian Government made amendments to the 
Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003
                The changes impacted all persons who require unmonitored access to a maritime security zone and now require them to obtain and display a Maritime Security Identification Card (MSIC).
With the introduction of this legislation, the maritime and offshore industries along with their supply and service chains required a means to apply for and obtain MSIC cards to maintain their compliance requirements.
Veritas Group developed a nationwide solution to this challenge. Through the development of an online application (which in 2005 when development began was still a relatively new concept) and back office processing system, the company streamlined the MSIC application process.
Veritas Group's award-winning software system has propelled the company to become the largest MSIC issuing body in Australia. Processing times range from 1 - 2 weeks while the remainder of the industry reports average times of 3 - 4 weeks.
Veritas Group's strategic partnership with Australia Post provides applicants multiple choices for the lodgement of applications.
