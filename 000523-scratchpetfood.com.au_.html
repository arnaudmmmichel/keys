Australia's best dog food, delivered to your doorstep | Scratch
Our most popular option for dogs of all ages - even large breed pups.
For any woofer that can't seem to shake tummy, skin or joint issues.
Clean, mean recipe full of hypoallergenic lamb and some nutritious ancient whole-grains. Great for very active dogs.
❓ Why we focused on kibble 
Scratch loves your dog's guts with healthy kibble, delivered direct. Scratch is the game-changing new breed of Australian dog food that puts dogs and the planet first.
Is your dog's food up to Scratch?
We're a bunch of dog food nerds that believe that dog food can...
Help dogs already suffering from them.
We’re famous around the dog park for our 8 rules to a healthy dog food
1. PLENTY of lean, high-quality protein from the best possible Australian meat
We only use animal protein from the human-food supply chain. No ‘pet food meat’ here.
2. ENERGY from animal fats and protein, not carbs
Typical kibble is 45-60% carbs. Scratch starts from 32.5%.
3. NO chemical preservatives and no added colours
No bulk bags made ages ago — you'll get 2 freshly-sealed 4kg bags made for your little mate.
4. NO processed soy, corn, cellulose, wheat and low starches
We avoid causes of so many skin and tummy issues that send the immune system wild.
5. WHOLE ingredients as much as possible
No filla, all killa. Whole ingredients keep more nutrients and reduce free-radicals.
6. NOTHING grouped, disguised or hidden
Australian dog food is unregulated(!). Yep. We’re the only brand to disclose ingredient %’s.
7. PLENTY of healthy oils with a variety of Omega-3 sources
Salmon, coconut, you name it. We mix through a stack of healthy oils high in DHA.
8. SUSTAINABLE approach to business and the produce in our food
We’re a proud B-Corp, donating 2% of revenue & working with the most ethical suppliers.
100% nutritionally complete from pup to old gal

“We came across scratch and we haven’t looked back!
Number 2’s are wonderful, no more itchy pooch and he absolutely adores the taste.”
“Mack is a staffy with skin and food allergies, so you can imagine how happy I was to find a dog food with NO chicken listed in the ingredients.
I’m very happy with Scratch, and so is Mack!!”
“Scratch is bloody awesome. Tooska has always had the worst tummy & we have given away multiple bags of food.
She has had so much more energy, she’s so much happier and has **** you can scoop… Thank you so much Scratch”
“Hugo had been having GI troubles for months- with lots of diarrhoea (as well as many trips to the vet!).
Scratch has helped settle his tummy, and helped him put on weight”
“Scratch was the first time I’ve seen her excited for dry food. She’s been on it for a little while now and she still loves it
And I love it because it’s reasonably priced, and gets delivered to my door!”
“My two staffies will finally eat dry kibble!
“My fussy terrier just loves Scratch biscuits and is now unimpressed by anything else.
And my Great Dane, well he Loves Everything, but I want to be sure it is good food for him.”
- Heather, Duke & Clifford's mum
“It’s the only food that the dogs did better on than raw”
“I cannot believe the difference in Scout our Frenchie since changing to Scratch…
Thank you Mike and Doug for creating scratch for our fur babies. You certainly have us for life”
“My Pugalier is 16 this year. She’d lost a certain amount of spark. Since feasting on Scratch she has seemed to lose years!”
“Since starting Duke on Scratch he isn’t scratching so much & no more runny #2’s!!!
Now onto the customer service. Hands down THE BEST, customer service around!”
“Turns out, our puppy IS food motivated, when he actually LIKES the food! Scratch has made training him so much easier”
“Changing to Scratch was the best decision we ever made for our puppy Murphy. We had tried so many different brands and all of them left him with an upset stomach.”

It all comes down to nutrition.
The 3 Scratch dog kibble recipes are full of:
No filla, all killa. No processed grains and corns that make your dog declare it’s turned paleo. Just all the premium meat and vegetables they could ever need in the one box.
100% locally and sustainably sourced from Australia. No dodgy bits. Just 
 to keep you pup up and at it all day long, and your senior dog from putting on the pounds.
No sneaky names and hidden ingredients – just the real deal. When we say ‘kangaroo’ we mean ‘kangaroo’. That along with goodies like pumpkin, turmeric, and chickpeas, our

Salmon, coconut, you name it. We mix through a stack of healthy oils high in DHA to give your puppy strong brain development & senior dog a shiny coat in those twilight years.

Gotta keep those pipes flowing, hey? All of our recipes are naturally rich 
 to promote good digestive health and boost the immune system. Say goodbye to runny tummies and hello to perfectly firm number 2s.
Stores discount so often because most kibble is made for efficiency. We changed how dog food is done, focusing on quality first.
Our kibble has helped over 30,000 puppies and senior dogs with:
Having the right mix of Omega 3 and 6 helps get that salon shine. We make and ship fresher food so nutrients don’t go stale sitting on the shelf for months.
Avoid the carb coma after every meal with the perfect mix of protein, healthy fat and fibre to keep blood sugar levels even. They’ll always be ready to rumble.
Fibre from whole vegetable ingredients helps to keep your pooch regular and can help naturally express anal glands. Expect well formed and easy to pick up poops that don’t stink from crap ingredients.
If your pup is eating something that does not agree with them they can have bad breath, stinky ears and farts that clear the room. With immune and digestion working, it’s all roses!
Avoid common allergens like chicken and improve their gut health to reduce inflammation and free up those joints. You’ll be amazed at what 
 does to their energy and happiness.
The best medicine is getting a healthy weight as soon as possible with our personalised feeding guides. Next is making sure inflammation from any bad food ingredients is eliminated. Finally, Salmon Oil is packed full of Omega 3.
We set out to design the single 
 by cutting out all the middlemen and spending more on the ingredients that help your woofer to thrive.

Variety is the spice of life. We worked with our nutritionist to make the best food for large breed puppies – and everyone else too. For dogs that aren’t super sensitive, having different sources of proteins makes sure there are a large range of nutrients and flavours to keep them healthy and interested.
If your Kangaroo recipe is so great, why a second option?

This 3-meat recipe initially came about after a shortage of kangaroo. This shortage meant that to get good quality kangaroo meat was going to cost more, which would in turn cost more to our Scratch customers. For some people – especially those with large dogs – the increase would mean they’d have to look elsewhere. So we got our heads together and asked: if it’s not kangaroo, what could be another great recipe?
The result was Turkey, Lamb & Beef: three proteins that are great for large breed pups without hitting the purse strings too much. It’s also good for pooches who don’t have too many intolerances or aren’t sensitive to particular meats.

If your dog has a diagnosed allergy to chicken, then it is best to go with the kangaroo recipe instead. The turkey is processed on the same production line as chicken, so there is a small chance that some will make it into the finished product. Better be safe.

Both are actually very high compared to most food on the market, especially for ones that don’t add protein concentrate from peas. We consider that 28%-32% is a sweet spot that provides all the protein your dog needs to thrive, without putting too much pressure on their digestive system and organs.

The best thing to do is to request a sample to try. The pieces in our Turkey, Lamb & Beef kibble are bigger in diameter, but are still quite thin. Bigger kibble can slow down fast eaters, as well as improving dental health. Best to check first before you dive into a box.

Subscription changes everything. We know how many subscribers we have, when their next deliveries are due and can time when we make and send them a fresh box.
Traditional store-bought dry dog food may be up to a year old before you buy it. Generally, it will have a best before date, but not a production date so it is hard to tell how old it is. Dog food is normally made in large runs, then sits in the manufacturer’s warehouse waiting for a distributor or retailer to place an order.
It then sits in their warehouse waiting for a distributor or retailer to place an order. Finally it sits on the shelf at the retail store with hundreds of other varieties, waiting for the customer to come in and want that exact product.

Most dogs will be fine switching between the two foods. But some will need to transition. If this is something you want to try, it’s best to test it out with your dog to see what works best for them

. We’ll ask for each dogs weight, age and activity level and a few other little things.
That helps us estimate their calorie needs, how much Scratch to feed them and how long a box would last. If you have multiple dogs, you’ll get a feeding guide unique to each of them, but they can eat the same box of food.
We’ll base the frequency of a fresh box arriving based off that feeding plan, but you have full control to pause, cancel, speed up or slow down your subscription as needed.
What if my dog doesn't like it?
Just like us hoomans, some dogs don’t like change.
Just like us hoomans, some dogs don’t like change.
It’s also important to remember that sometimes the old food that they may be used to may have had lots of salt or other additives that made it taste great, even if it was not healthy. Be persistent and try not to be trained by your fur baby, but sometimes they might just not be into it.
If you’ve transitioned to Scratch and you’re still unsure, we do offer a 100% money-back guarantee on your first order, no questions asked.

Different ingredients produce different amounts of energy and some food is more dense than others, so one cup of two different dog foods can also have a big difference in energy availability.

30 years ago, most dogs lived in the backyard rather than on the bed. We now fully accept them into our families as little fur babies.
While pet food has improved, we don’t think that regulation has kept up. In fact, it is still only a voluntary standard that exists, and that was written by the pet food industry itself.
While our manufacturing partners are PFIAA members and audited to the voluntary standard, we have currently chosen not to join. We especially believe that the standard does not demand the transparency that consumers expect and deserve. The flexibility that it allows marketers to deceive and promote is more appropriate for business generations ago, not now.
Each box of Scratch contains 2x 4kg bags of freshly made Scratch

Thought we'd try a new brand for our boy and he absolutely loves it. He's never eaten so many bics before.
He loves all the flavours too
Since ditching the big brand dog kibble and switching to Scratch, all of my 3 pups have had no more gut issues and cannot wait to get their scratch food morning and night.
They even love it as a treat at any time. I am happy because no one wants to see their pooch suffering with constant gastric issues.
Thanks for caring so much Scratch creators!
Everything about Scratch was great but the kibble size was too big for what our Chihuahuas were used to. I contacted Scratch - they replied quickly and when we both agreed that there was nothing left to problem solve, I received a full refund and passed the remaining food on to a friend. Excellent product and customer service.
My two Rottweilers Nina and Boofy absolutely adore Scratch. After the first week or so after I slowly switched from their old kibble to completely Scratch diet they noticed their poos were better, believe me as the servant I noticed as well. Their coats are amazing so shiny and soft, their teeth are also clean and shiny white again. Nina's weight problem is resolving and I can't call her Fatty McStuffins anymore.
My dog Nix, he has switched easily to Scratch, I do add some other meat to his biscuits.
He seems to have lost a bit of weight, that he probably didn’t need to lose. He is an active dog. In saying that he is ready for his food instead of not always eating is food straight away before.
I think I will get an extra bag every 2 months, as we ran out before the next delivery. So far all is going well.
Our most popular option for dogs of all ages - even large breed pups.
For any woofer that can't seem to shake tummy, skin or joint issues.

Our Kangaroo single protein dog food recipe history
Many brands change recipes regularly without notifying customers or changing labels, but that's not how we roll. If you're a customer, you'll always be told ahead of any change taking place.
 of any changes & improvements that we've ever made to this recipe.
Meat industries can be horribly inhumane so we take our supply very seriously. We only use kangaroo that is processed by members of the Kangaroo Industry Association of Australia.
This provides a more humane, higher quality and more sustainable kangaroo that has been primarily collected for human consumption, not just pet food.
Used to treat and prevent joint disorders such as osteoarthritis, it's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.
We boost this recipe with small, easily-digestible collagen particles to strengthen damaged joint cartilage.
This recipe is 100% nutritionally complete from puppy through to their vintage years. We don't suggest this for large breed puppies until fully grown.
Dog food is unregulated and can feature only 5% of the promoted meat. We're leading a new standard of transparency with ingredient percentages so you can really know what's in your dogs food.
Scratch well exceeds the AAFCO minimum requirements for all life stages.

Yes, our kangaroo recipe is great for all puppies except for large breed puppies (woofers who are expected to weigh over 30 kilograms as an adult).
Large breed puppies have very specific requirements to allow them to grow healthily and to reduce the risk of developmental orthopaedic diseases. Look to our 
The kangaroo recipe has a high energy content (from good fats & oils) which can lead to large breeds growing too quickly and increasing health risks. It also has higher calcium content than suggested for large breeds. If we think your dog might not be suitable for Scratch while it’s growing, we’ll prevent you from purchasing at checkout to ensure that no dog owner purchases without checking with their vet first.
If you have a large breed puppy, our Turkey recipe is for you.

How much fibre should dogs have?

There are two types of fibre – crude (insoluble) and dietary (soluble). Crude fibre is responsible for how fast their food passes through their intestines and is what is reported on dog food nutritional labels. Dietary fibre is responsible for feeding gut bacteria which can help to control blood sugar levels and how the body stores and deals with fats.
A healthy dog diet should contain between 3% and 5.5%. All our recipes are high in fibre compared to most other dry dog foods.
Higher fibre will mean that they poo more, but 2-3 a day is healthy. Our 
 should make that much easier on you too!
Why dry dog food over wet, raw or homemade?
Raw food diets are great as they have no processing, but it can be hard to get a...
Raw food diets are great as they have no processing, but it can be hard to get a completed and balanced diet from raw food alone. It also has other drawbacks like being fresh only for a few days, potential microorganisms such as e-coli, salmonella etc. Cooked protein is also easier to digest than raw.
Like dry dog food, chilled dog food has the kill step to eradicate pathogens. It has a short shelf life and often treated with a lot of preservatives to last the time from factory to home.
Wet dog food is also processed at a high temperature for a long period while sealed to ensure that all micro-organisms are killed. It generally tastes great but contains mostly water and a lot of gelling agents to make the gravy. A half-used can stinks out the home pretty quickly too!
Dry dog food in comparison is the most convenient, preserved by dehydration and receives a quick temperature kill-step to ensure all microorganisms are eliminated.
Can I mix kibble (dry dog food) with other foods?
Sure! Mixing different types of food is great, but try to be consistent.
Sure! Mixing different types of food is great, but try to be consistent.
Dogs digestive systems are not as flexible as ours so when you do mix, try to keep the mix more or less the same.

There’s no such thing really. Sure, we could find a hot celebrity vet, pay them some cash and have a photoshoot as they run down a beach with a dog, but thats not how we roll.
Our recipes are developed with a Masters Degree qualified Animal Nutritionist. Scratch grain free dog food exceeds the standards of ‘complete & balanced’ pet food as defined by AAFCO.

Subscription changes everything. We know how many subscribers we have, when their next deliveries are due and can time when we make and send them a fresh box.
Traditional store-bought dry dog food may be up to a year old before you buy it. Generally, it will have a best before date, but not a production date so it is hard to tell how old it is. Dog food is normally made in large runs, then sits in the manufacturer’s warehouse waiting for a distributor or retailer to place an order.
It then sits in their warehouse waiting for a distributor or retailer to place an order. Finally it sits on the shelf at the retail store with hundreds of other varieties, waiting for the customer to come in and want that exact product.

We always kept in mind that Snoop (Doug’s beagle) would be our first customer and wanted to make him the ultimate dog food.
We also knew that being online-only, we had more money to spend on quality ingredients than standard retail brands. We then worked with our manufacturer and an animal nutritionist to develop the best recipe we could.
We even had to twist their arm and source new high quality ingredients just for us. The things we really get passionate about are:
Grain free, corn free, soy free food, with low starches
High protein but only through real ingredients – no concentrate
Each piece of kibble is approximately 14mm in diameter and pretty flat.

28% of the Scratch recipe is Kangaroo Meal. This is Kangaroo meat, bones & organs that has the fat removed, then is dehydrated and milled into a powder. 5% of the recipe is Kangaroo digest. This is normally hidden in other manufacturer’s products as ‘gravy’ or ‘natural flavours’.
Our digest is Kangaroo meat and organs that are emulsified with a natural enzyme that breaks down the proteins into its amino acids. This makes it easier for dogs to digest and takes the flavour up to 11!
Some other premium foods have higher protein. Why is Scratch 28% protein?

We wanted to make a food with only one animal protein to make it as simple for dogs to process as possible, rather than filling it out with cheap proteins like poultry meal. Having one animal protein also helps to reduce the chance of allergies. We could not add any more kangaroo without unbalancing the food.
Higher protein doesn’t necessarily mean best either. While high protein is a signal for potentially healthier food, not all proteins are equal.

. We’ll ask for each dogs weight, age and activity level and a few other little things.
That helps us estimate their calorie needs, how much Scratch to feed them and how long a box would last. If you have multiple dogs, you’ll get a feeding guide unique to each of them, but they can eat the same box of food.
We’ll base the frequency of a fresh box arriving based off that feeding plan, but you have full control to pause, cancel, speed up or slow down your subscription as needed.
What if my dog doesn't like it?
Just like us hoomans, some dogs don’t like change.
Just like us hoomans, some dogs don’t like change.
It’s also important to remember that sometimes the old food that they may be used to may have had lots of salt or other additives that made it taste great, even if it was not healthy. Be persistent and try not to be trained by your fur baby, but sometimes they might just not be into it.
If you’ve transitioned to Scratch and you’re still unsure, we do offer a 100% money-back guarantee on your first order, no questions asked.

Different ingredients produce different amounts of energy and some food is more dense than others, so one cup of two different dog foods can also have a big difference in energy availability.
Our feeding suggestions are usually pretty spot on based on whether your dog is in a healthy weight range, overweight, etc., but you can monitor your dogs weight and use common sense to feed more or less if your dogs weight changes unexpectedly.

Such a great quality and service
One of our boys is very fussy and has a pretty sensitive stomach and the other one is not fussy at all! After doing some research we landed across scratch and safe to say the boys love it and no upset stomachs so far, when they hear the bag open we have their full attention 😂
The transition was easy as clear instructions were provided with all the measurements!
Our 2-year old Lagotto Romangnolo, Rizzo. is very motivated by food, yet it comes with some allergies unfortunately. So after some research and recommendations we’ve scaled back and found ourselves on the Scratch wagon. Well she is IN LOVE and does all commands and more at dinner time. She is quite vocal as I open the food bin and the rest is history, thank you Scratch from our household; we are all really pleased with this union!
Sykes loves his new food from Scratch !! He has so much more energy , he’s not looking for food all the time . His skin is starting to look better and he seems so much happier 😊. It’s also great value for money , half the price I was paying for his Vet recommended food. Great product !!
Maia and Blitz move over to Scratch Kangaroo 
Both Maia and Blitz are senior dogs and they just love their new kibble. There were no problems transitioning to it. I mix it with their home-made wet food and it is all gone in a very short time.

Delicious single-protein kibble with healthy grains for modern tummies. With plenty of Aussie lamb and veg, it’s the closest old mate’s gonna get to a Sunday roast.

Dogs that struggle with high-fibre recipes like our Turkey or Kangaroo kibbles will appreciate the lower fibre content, while naturally hypoallergenic lamb and the same healthy oils make this a favourite of even the most sensitive tummies.

Many grains like wheat and corn can cause sensitivities in dogs, but the whole oats, brown rice and chia in this recipe are easy to digest and process efficiently in the gut. Lamb is also naturally hypoallergenic so this recipe is still great for sensitive dogs.
With lower fibre, this is a great alternative for dogs that poo a bit too much on our grain-free recipes.
For overweight dogs, we’d suggest our lower-carb Turkey or Kangaroo recipes.

Not all grains are created equal. “Grain” can mean a whole lotta different things, from highly processed and refined wheats and corns, to healthier alternatives of ancient grains and pseudo-cereals like spelt, freekeh, bulgur, farro, oats, brown rice, chia and pseudo-cereals like quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and chia.

This recipe includes as much as we could include without being nutritionally unbalanced.
Lots of dogs foods are called “Lamb” or “Kangaroo” but they also include Chicken if you read the fine print. Many grain inclusive food will include highly refined wheat or corn gluten to boost their protein. Adding a dash of pea protein allows us to make a healthy, protein packed feast that stays away from ingredients like chicken, wheat and corn that cause lots of allergies.

Yes, our lamb with ancient grains recipe is great for all puppies except for large breed puppies (woofers who are expected to weigh over 30 kilograms as an adult).
Large breed puppies have very specific requirements to allow them to grow healthily and to reduce the risk of developmental orthopaedic diseases.
The lamb recipe has higher calcium content than suggested for large breeds. If we think your dog might not be suitable for Scratch while it’s growing, we’ll prevent you from purchasing at checkout to ensure that no dog owner purchases without checking with their vet first.

Being online-only, we had more money to spend on quality ingredients than standard retail brands. We then worked with our manufacturer and an animal nutritionist to develop the best recipe we could.
We even had to twist their arm and source new high quality ingredients just for us. The things we really get passionate about are:
Using plenty of more nutritious, whole ingredients
Avoid the heavily industrial processed grains like wheat and corn that so many dogs have built up sensitivities too
High protein with the focus on real ingredients

Wheat, corn, soy and white rice are cheap which is why they pack out the majority of dog food. This recipe costs us more to make than the Turkey Grain-Free option, which is why it is priced higher.
This recipe uses whole Australian grains (Oats, Brown Rice and Chia) that are very expensive to source, but far more nutritious.
There’s a huge difference in the farming and nutritional profile of whole brown rice compared to processed corn for instance.

Subscription changes everything. We know how many subscribers we have, when their next deliveries are due and can time when we make and send them a fresh box.
Traditional store-bought dry dog food may be up to a year old before you buy it. Generally, it will have a best before date, but not a production date so it is hard to tell how old it is. Dog food is normally made in large runs, then sits in the manufacturer’s warehouse waiting for a distributor or retailer to place an order.
It then sits in their warehouse waiting for a distributor or retailer to place an order. Finally it sits on the shelf at the retail store with hundreds of other varieties, waiting for the customer to come in and want that exact product.
We make Scratch recipes monthly, sending you two freshly sealed 4kg bags per box. Keep one sealed while you’re feeding the first and open it when old mate is ready for more.

As puppies inherit their microbiome from their parents, there’s no knowing how a puppy will fare with different ingredients, so it all comes down to personal preference for you, and observing how your dogs body reacts to different foods.
Grains are neither healthier or unhealthier than grain-free – they’re just big food groups that vary a lot.
All of our recipes are 100% nutritionally balanced for puppies and we’d feel great about feeding our own puppies any of them.

Hang on, aren't grains bad for all dogs? The quick answer: not all grains are bad.
And not all grains are created equal. “Grain” can mean a whole lotta different things, from highly processed and refined wheats and corns, to healthier alternatives of ancient grains and pseudo-cereals like spelt, freekeh, bulgur, farro, oats, brown rice, chia and pseudo-cereals like quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and chia.
Dogs are all different, each with their own personalities, dietary needs and taste in music. Most dogs will thrive on a well-balanced recipe with healthy grains – particularly those with IBS, kidney problems or who have you reaching for the poo bag on high-fibre recipes.
At the end of the day, dog food recipes are only as good as the ingredients they include, and the quantities used. Too much of something or too little of something else, and over time you can create imbalances. Our co-founder Doug nerds out over ingredient sourcing, working with the latest lab research and independent nutritionists to bring your dog life-changing food.
Each box of Scratch contains 2x 4kg bags of freshly made Scratch kibble.

The prof is in the Poo!
I have three cattle dogs and I have always made my own version of raw food but was concerned I wasn’t getting the balance right. And I have definite concerns about the quality of every day Kibble. I’m not even sure how I came about scratch, but it resonated with me and I decided to try it the dogs all transitioned really well and seem to love it. They have all been on it for a few weeks now with the addition of a little bit of raw and I have noticed a change in all of their bowel movements. Their poo is really healthy looking and no smell any more and what I also liked was the text message I received from scotch asking how it was going and from that I realise I was over ordering and the lovely lady adjusted my order so that I was not paying for food. I didn’t need very impressive. Love the products and love the service.
Our dog has highly sensitive stomach issues, when the food didn't agree Scratch organised to send out a new bag at no cost. Even when this didn't work they organised to send out further samples to ensure our dog was okay. The new samples worked and we could not be happier. Scratch you get 5 stars all round. Thank you !
Peggy can be funny with new tastes but not with scratch, she loved it from the get go!
I was at my wits end trying to find a good quality food that our fussy dog would eat that didn’t give him diarrhoea. He would never eat the biscuits straight from the bag and It didn’t matter what I put on top of his meal he would only eat the good stuff on top and leave the rest. He preferred to go hungry and was losing condition and weight. I stumbled across Scratch and decided to give it a shot as I had nothing to lose. From the first bowlful he has hoovered his meals and loves both the lamb and kangaroo. Meal times are one of his favourite activities of the day and I no longer stress what to give him to encourage him to eat. He is now on his third box of half kangaroo and half lamb and no toppings have ever been added. He happily eats it in one go until his bowl is empty. He often is seen licking his empty bowl. The admin team are wonderful too and an absolute pleasure to deal with. Nothing is an issue and any advice I have sought from them has been answered promptly. I love the fact the product is all Australian and is delivered to my door. Thank you Mike for such a great product. It was the best decision I have ever made!
My Fur Babies are loving Scratch
I have 2 little rescue dogs, one in particular has only ever known scraps so it's been a challenge to get him used to eating dog food & to find the right fit. He's had a rough start in life so I want his forever home to be all it should be which includes the best & the right food for him. It's taken a few weeks but he's starting to choose Scratch from his other choices, a great sign that Scratch is right for him. My other little girl went for Scratch straight away & prefers it. I can highly recommend.

Common questions about puppy food & Scratch
Is Scratch OK for large breed puppies?
We’ve got large breed pups & their quick-growing bones covered too, but only on our Turkey, Beef & Lamb Recipe.
Our Kangaroo and Lamb recipes have a calcium:phosphorus ratio slightly too high for us to recommend for large breed puppies.
How much protein do puppies need?
Puppies require at least 22.5% protein (on a dry matter basis).
A high-quality protein provides the essential building blocks for muscles and organs. But not all protein is created equal. Dogs do better with plenty of high-quality animal protein. The best puppy food should have a specific animal protein as the first ingredient – for example ‘Turkey’, not ‘poultry’ which can suggest a mix of animal leftovers.
Both Scratch recipes only use specific animal proteins and have more meat than most other foods and would be classed as a 
What age should they start eating adult food?
Adult food is just a worse version of puppy kibble, not requiring as much protein and DHA. But a healthy adult dog will thrive on high protein diets and DHA comes from salmon oil, so a really good puppy food should be ideal for a dog through their adult lives.
A puppy is technically an adult for feeding requirements once they physically mature and stop growing in height.
How much should I feed my puppy?
Good question. It depends on their age, breed & expected adult size. A Saint Bernard is a puppy for a lot longer than a Chihuahua for instance.
The food they’re eating also changes things as different foods produce different energy. Scratch feeding plans are tailored to the recipe that they’re eating (which you can also switch up if they’re fussy and seek variety).
When you get started with Scratch, we’ll ask some questions and calculate a feeding guide for your puppy based on this information.
As they grow, you can update their weight via your pups plan webpage for their instantly updated feeding guide. You can see our suggested feeding guide prior to signing up if you’re curious.
Can you mix feed kibble with other puppy food?
Sure can. We have plenty of customers mix feeding Scratch with raw, or even wet food in their younger years.
We’ll give you a feeding guide upon signup, and you can change how often you’d like Scratch sent to suit your mix feeding habits.
At what age can puppies move to kibble?
Puppies should get solid food starting at about four weeks, when they’re not able to get all the calories they need from their mother’s milk. Most puppies are weaned by six weeks.
With lots of fibre, will they poo more?
Sure will – and that’s generally a very good thing. A healthy tummy should mean at least 2 bathroom breaks per day, but Scratch dogs average about 3. We’ve got some 
 to make that easier for you if you decide to go with our 
Sure! Puppies love treats and they can be an essential tool of teaching and rewarding good behaviour. Try to avoid the excessively salty (learn about 
) and sugary treats that they’ll love, but do their health no good.
Natural body part treats such as our 
 are delicious, high in protein and contain plenty of healthy fats.
What oils are in your dry puppy food?
All 3 of our recipes use our 4-oil mix – coconut oil, salmon oil, sunflower oil and flaxseed oil. 
Some tips in evaluating our best puppy food versus options at the store
Dog food is unregulated. Ask questions of brands
Yep, it’s true. Despite our furry compadres meaning so much to us, dogs are still objects in the law and their food is completely unregulated. Scratch is the only brand to reveal every % of every ingredient, and get to know your pup from day 1.
Food can contain as little as 5% of the meat advertised
Crazy, huh. Store-bought foods are members of the PFIAA (code for pet food industry of Australia). Being a member gives the green light to promote a meat in the name, but to have as little as 5% of it in the recipe. A little dodgy we think!
Recipes change all the time without anyone being the wiser. Look out for ingredient lists that say vague things like ‘may contain’, or ‘and/or’ that suggests brands switching to whatever ingredients are cheaper at the time. Scratch uses the exact same ingredients everytime so you know what’s really in your puppies food.
Make sure everything is weighed evenly
Ever wonder how some foods promote over 60% meat? They’re sneaky buggers dog food companies. In kibble, all food is dehydrated before food is made. Sneaky brands compare meat when fresh (and weighing more) to vegetables when dehydrated (and light) to make the meat content seem more than what it really is.

❓ Why we focused on kibble 
What makes the best senior dog food?
As dogs enter their senior years, food makes such a difference to quality of life. A great senior dog food will help them manage their weight as their metabolism slows down, support their joints and their immune system.
Scratch is full of good energy and immune-boosting Australian ingredients – perfect for older dogs.
Scratch is the best senior dog food to get more out of life
Food is the #1 impact on energy – feed whole ingredients
Old dogs don’t have to act like old dogs. It’s amazing what a difference food can do to an old fella’s energy and happiness.
By using whole ingredients and avoiding those that more easily turn to fat (we’re looking at you starches & grains), many dogs can wind back the clock on a food like Scratch.
Not all protein is created equal
Dogs do better with plenty of high-quality animal protein. The best senior dog foods have a specific animal protein as the first ingredient – for example ‘Turkey’, not ‘poultry’ which can suggest a mix of human food chain leftovers.
Scratch only uses premium, Australian specific animal protein from human-grade abattoirs.
Prevent weight gain as your senior dog ages
If your senior dog is overweight or obese, the most important thing you can do for them is getting their weight back to normal. Dogs that are overweight or obese die on average two years earlier than dogs at a healthy weight. That is a lot of time you miss out on together.
Scratch is very good as a 
, with a personalized feeding guide as they age, allowing you to prevent guesswork and overfeeding.
Food can be preventative – look after their immune system
Most of the immune system is generated from the gut, so feeding a better senior dog food will build gut resilience to fight infection, deal with stress and protect from cancers later in life. Scratch builds gut health for resilient dogs.

Common questions about senior dog food
Do senior dogs have different nutritional requirements to adult dogs and puppies?
There are officially only different nutritional requirements for puppies and adult dogs, not a specific profile for senior dogs. Most dog foods specially designed for seniors are more about weight management and marketing. A great senior dog food can also be great for adults and puppies. This is how we have designed Scratch.
puppy food vs adult dog food
At what age should my dog look for senior dog food?
Whether your dog is a “Senior” or not depends a lot on their size and breed. Giant breeds like Great Danes, Dogue de Bordeaux, Saint Bernards and Bernese Mountain dogs are senior dogs from 5 or 6 years old. Small dogs like Jack Russells and Chihuahua live the longest and are not seniors until they are over 10. Most dogs are seniors by around 8-9 years. This includes breeds like Labradors, Staffys & Border Collies and Beagles.
What sort of food should a dog with Pancreatitis have?
If your dog has had pancreatitis, they will generally be prescribed a low-fat diet. Scratch has 15% fat which usually is a great energy source. Vets often suggest a diet below 8% fat(on a dry basis) to avoid getting pancreatitis again.
Is Scratch OK for senior dogs with kidney disease?
Processing high amounts of protein is thought to put too much stress on diseased kidneys. Most vets will suggest a diet lower in protein than Scratch’s 28% if your senior dog has kidney disease. It is important to get specific advice from your dog’s vet if they have Kidney problems as they still need all the essential amino acids from protein to stay healthy.
After obesity, dental diseases is the most common health problem for the modern senior dog. Mature dogs that have not been getting raw bones and dental treats or toys to chew on – or regular tooth brushing and cleaning are likely to have dental disease. often making their mouth sensitive. They may also have missing or removed teeth that make it harder to chew.
If your senior dog is not enjoying their dry food anymore as it hurts their mouth, you can still use a great dry senior dog food – just add some water to it to soften it.
What are the most important things for the immune system?
Older dogs will benefit from a 
 focused on supporting their immune system which weakens as they age. The immune system is very complex, but the keys to this are good quality sources of animal protein, zinc and vitamin C. Protein is crucial as it provides the essential building blocks for muscles, organs and the immune system.
Does Scratch senior dog food help with joints, arthritis & inflammation?
A healthy senior dog food will also have good levels of omega 3 fatty acids (from cold water fish) to help reduce inflammation. Scratch uses Tasmanian Salmon Oil as the primary source of omega 3 as well as Turmeric to combat inflammation.
 is supplemented with glucosamine, hydrolised collagen & chondroitin to protect and support damaged joints in senior dogs.
Do green-lipped muscles help senior dogs?
There is evidence that Green-Lipped Muscles help. The issue with including this as an ingredient in senior dog food is that it is very temperature sensitive and easily de-activated. It is best to use freeze-dried Green-Lipped Muscles as a treat or powder instead. This way you also know exactly how much your dog is getting.
How does Scratch help with weight control?
Most commercial dog foods designed for weight management just include more fillers to make you feel like you are still feeding them enough. This can even be by adding sawdust! (appears as “Powdered Cellulose” on labels).
We take a different approach. If your dog needs to reduce weight, we personalise their feeding plan, provide you with a scoop and make sure that we make the 
 with ingredients that the body can get the most out of.
How many times per day should I feed my senior dog?
It’s best to feed older dogs twice a day.
Do senior dogs needs supplements when using Scratch?
Senior dogs don’t necessarily need supplements, but many will benefit from them. Many dogs (particularly active and larger breeds) suffer from joint and cartilage damage over time. Too many zoomies ey!
 already includes Glucosamine, Chondroitin and Collagen to strengthen damaged joint cartilage and treat and prevent joint disorders such as osteoarthritis.
Can senior dogs still have treats?
For sure – as long as they’re not too salty, too sugary or fed too often (regardless of how many sad looks they give you).
Natural body parts are the best treat for most senior dogs, such as our 
Is wet food better for my senior dog compared to dry food?
Wet dog food can be easier on dogs with severe dental disease, but much of it does them little good as wet dog food is often filled with a lot of gelatins and poor quality meat.
 like Scratch usually contains more meat, helps to control dental health and produces significantly less packaging waste.
Scratch is made fresher and with whole Aussie produce rather than the processed ingredients that goes into many dry dog foods.
Learn why we focused on improving dry dog food
Should senior dogs eat a grain-free food?
Grains themselves aren’t bad, but the majority of the grains used in dog foods are, and they’re used in way too high quantities.
At the end of the day, a senior dog needs a food that is easy to digest, is balanced so as to not overload particular organs, provides nutritious energy and limits inflammation.
In our view, there are many unhealthy grain-free dog foods, just as there are many unhealthy grain-inclusive dog foods.
Our 3 Scratch recipes (2 of which are grain-free) have all been designed under this ethos, helping to give senior dogs a quality (and longer) end to life.
Does Scratch has age-specific senior dog food?
We don’t have a recipe that is only suitable for older dogs. All 3 Scratch recipes are designed to exceed AAFCO standards for all life stages and are suitable from pup through to old fella.
How do we do it? Without the store mark-ups, we can afford to include better ingredients from the get-go – ingredients that build up gut health, offer protein from high-quality meat, skip fillers and support with various supplements.
Should large breed senior dogs eat senior food or large breed food?
Your large breed dog will be better off with a dog food suited to their reduced energy output and ageing joints, and would not benefit from a 
 like they would earlier in life. Stick with a food such as our Kangaroo
