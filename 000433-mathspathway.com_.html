Our Diagnostic Test is an online adaptive tool that efficiently and comprehensively gathers insights into your students.
We don’t just give your students a grade, we give you specific, detailed data that determines what content the students will have access to. We identify what your students do and don't know and what they are ready to learn next.
Our content aligns specifically with all national and state curriculum & standard requirements. It is written by a team of teachers and mathematicians using the latest pedagogical research. We continually improve our content based on student performance, ensuring students are learning productively and efficiently.
Writing things down has many cognitive benefits: our content has students completing work in their exercise books. We also offer regular spaced practice to students to ensure they remember it and develop their fluency. This helps them to be more successful as they encounter new content.
 Teachers can embed explicit instruction using the Mini-Lesson Planner to identify small groups who are ready for the same key concept (that relates to your teaching program focus). During Mini Lessons, teachers can facilitate conversation, use concrete materials and help students see connections within the content they are learning as well as real life scenarios. 
 Every state and system has their own reporting requirements - Maths Pathway makes compliance easy, including with audit requirements, state reporting, and parent communication.
In a differentiated classroom, we need to give students the capacity to work effectively and independently. We help to ensure that all students maximise their mathematical potential by giving them access to work they are ready for. They won't have to read through pages of explanations or watch hours of examples; they'll be engaged in a series of well-scaffolded questions designed to build their understanding. 
Each module is part of a coherent sequence of learning that ensures students are building a deep understanding as they progress. 
	Our Learning Team writes the content for you, but you determine which parts of the course are focused on at any given time through our Topic Planner. 
Check out our accessibility features that help as many students as possible engage in the learning process. 
 Assessment doesn't have to provoke dread in your students - or you! Automatically generated and individualised online tests save you preparation time and keep your finger on the pulse. Fortnightly assessments provide an ideal timeframe to give feedback on whether students have understood the work they have completed and are ready to move forward. You will have time to sit with students one-on-one to discuss progress, celebrate wins and equip them with strategies and goals to be more successful in the next fortnight. 
 With an efficient approach to delivering content as your backbone, we give you more time to give your students authentic maths experiences. These can be done in small doses on a daily basis, which we call Energisers, or larger doses each fortnight and term, through what we call Rich Tasks and Projects. Students get to apply their knowledge in solving problems and identifying patterns, feeling success and ownership over their learning. Week-long projects each semester also provide another avenue for assessment and reporting.

One of our Partnership Specialists will be in touch soon. Alternatively, if there is a time that suits you better, 
Do I need devices in the classroom to use Maths Pathway?
You will need at least 70% of students to have access to a device on a regular basis and there are some cases (e.g. diagnostics and tests) where every student will need access. The Maths Pathway Student Portal will run on both computers (laptops and desktops) as well as touch devices like Android tablets and iPads. We recommend that the Teacher Portal is accessed from a computer.
It’s important to note that Maths Pathway is not an online tool. While students will spend some time accessing content online, many learning modes including targeted explicit teaching to small groups, energisers and Rich Lessons with the whole class form important parts of the model.
Is it aligned to the curriculum?
Yes. Our learning content is developed by the Maths Pathway learning team and is written to the ACARA Maths 1-10 Curriculum. It is subsequently mapped to all separate State curriculums/syllabi including the Australian Curriculum, Victorian Curriculum and NSW Syllabus.
Are students only sitting in front of the computer all the time? What is the teacher doing?
No. At least 70% of the teachers time is spent with individual students. Maths Pathway incorporates different learning modes to ensure that students are receiving content in a variety of ways. This includes individual modules, targeted explicit teaching in small groups, energisers to break up lessons and Rich tasks designed for whole class collaboration.
How does Maths Pathway work in the classroom?
Maths Pathway isn’t an online tool — it’s a whole new way of teaching and learning maths in the classroom. Our model combines data-driven insights, systemisation and high impact strategies to increase student engagement and teacher impact. We’ve made the first professional development video for new teachers available to watch here to give you an overview of how the model works.
Maths Pathway also provides multiple levels of support, live and on-demand training, as well as a dedicated consultant to help you and your colleagues throughout implementation of the model and beyond.
Can I try this out in my class/ intervention students?
Maths Pathway is designed as a stand-alone model that empowers teachers to personalise the learning experiences of each of their students and effectively replaces any resources you are currently using for maths, such as textbooks or other online programs. Maths Pathway is not used as an intervention program, and unfortunately we do not offer individual licenses for one class or a particular group of students. This is a whole pedagogical approach to teaching and learning at the school. We implement across a full cohort, usually starting off with Year 5/6 in a Primary or Year 7 in a High School.
The licence cost of Maths Pathway is calculated based on the size and demographics of your school. Contact us to learn more.
Can I use Maths Pathway with younger students?
Maths Pathway is designed for students from levels 5-10, however we do offer a diagnostic for younger students called Early Insights. Early Insights is a flexible, new F-4 assessment tool designed by primary teachers for young students. You can learn more about Early Insights here.
How long has Maths Pathway been around for?
Maths Pathway was founded in 2013 by Australian teachers Richard Wilson and Justin Matthys to address the spread of ability they were challenged with in their classroom.
What’s the difference between Maths Pathway and other maths programs I’ve been hearing about?
Maths Pathway is a comprehensive Learning and Teaching Model, rather than simply an online product to supplement maths.
Other programs out there usually do pre & post testing, determined by the age-based curriculum. Our diagnostic tool is adaptive so the questions change based on what students answer and their gaps/competencies are assessed across the curriculum from Level 1-10A. The appropriate curriculum-mapped content is then delivered via online modules.
However, we definitely don’t believe that students should just sit on their devices. We use technology to simply take away the admin burden of the teacher having to spend time to assess where each student in the class is at, and then which piece of content to deliver them, at just the right time. We take care of the scope and sequencing planning so you can focus on teaching in the classroom.
Where can I see more research about the practices within Maths Pathway?
Please read the research white-paper: "An Evidence-Based Approach for Mathematics Instruction – Analysis of the Maths Pathway pedagogical model" by Dr Kripa Sundar and Dr Katerina Schenke here.
Maths Pathway is an evidence-based pedagogical approach so we use best-practices in teaching to ensure that teachers are being as impactful as possible in every interaction with their students. You can also learn more about the research behind our model in our Impact Report and on our blog.
I’m a parent, can I use Maths Pathway with my children?
Yes! Maths Pathway at Home is perfect for homeschoolers and afterschool support. We are currently offering a 2 week free trial! 
Can I see some independent research into the impact and methodology of Maths Pathway?
You can read: An Evidence-Based Approach for Mathematics Instruction – Analysis of the Maths Pathway pedagogical model by Dr Kripa Sundar and Dr Katerina Schenke here.
We also share further details about our model on a yearly basis via our Impact Report. This document outlines the principles that underpin our teaching and learning model, the research behind it and the results achieved by 76,000+ students using Maths Pathway. You can also find some anecdotal evidence shared by our schools in it. These schools have experienced an increase in the number of students pursuing Senior Maths courses in Years 11 and 12.

Your child begins by completing a diagnostic assessment that provides granular data on their gaps and competencies. This data forms a learning profile detailing what each student has mastered, what they are ready to learn next and what gaps exist. 
Once your child completes the diagnostic and receives their learning profile they will be delivered the curriculum mapped content they’re ready for in the form of modules. Each module is comprised of worksheets that your child can access through their learning portal and complete in their workbooks. Students work on these modules for two weeks.  The online learning portal is where your child accesses their diagnostic, learning profile, modules and ongoing formative assessments.
At the end of a learning cycle, your child will complete a formative assessment that determines their progress and what learning should take place next. This component is essential for effective personalised learning to gather real-time data and enable timely feedback and intervention.
Maths Pathway also measures three very important areas during learning cycles — effort, accuracy and growth.
Effort is the number of content modules completed versus the number of modules assigned for the cycle. High effort can be seen when students are keen to work hard and see how far they can push themselves. Lower levels of effort might be due to disengagement, or if a student is struggling.
Accuracy is a measure of how many content modules a student has mastered, as a proportion of their total completed modules for that cycle. Mastery is an important part of the Maths Pathway model as we know that students learn maths on a continuum, so they must understand each concept before they can reach higher levels of maths.
The growth rate is a really important piece of feedback for students as it emphasises the value of continual development. A student’s growth rate reflects the new work that they’ve mastered over time.
At the end of the cycle, a tutor will take a look at your child’s work and provide feedback. We think it’s really important to have humans checking work as they can quickly identify misconceptions and pick up on silly mistakes in your child's work that machines would mark wrong.

meta title:About Us
meta description:N/A

Maths Pathway's Learning and Teaching model supports teachers to deliver personalised learning to every student, increasing growth and engagement in the classroom.
We envision a world where every student experiences growth and success in maths. No matter their current level, or their background. We believe the way to achieve this is to support teachers to have an even greater impact in the classroom and that’s exactly what our model does.
We make individualised learning practical by using tools that put administration in the background and bring teaching to the front, where it belongs.
We make individualised learning practical by using tools that put administration in the background and bring teaching to the front, where it belongs.
What makes us different? We actually care whether or not students are learning. We focus on growth, not attainment levels. We provide teachers with support, not extra paperwork. We want to reinstate the dream you had when you first walked into the classroom, before it became buried under administration and staff meetings. To make a difference in the lives of your students.
We don’t claim to be a new idea or a magic online solution. In fact, the problems we solve are not new problems. The concept of teaching a student what they’re ready to learn is as old as teaching itself. But that’s exactly why we exist. We want to see every student make progress, from wherever they happen to start from.
The Maths Pathway model is the first and only of its kind and we’re proud to share our love of maths with more than 3,700 teachers and 83,000 students across Australia.
"When I walk through the world, I see things differently. I notice numbers, and the way they create patterns and relationships. I search for the connections between the abstract and the concrete. I compute 90% confidence intervals for the quality of my coffee. When my two year-old and I check our carton for broken eggs, it becomes a counting exercise. When I go to a cafe with my five year-old, it becomes an exploration of the difference between one cup and zero cups, and whether zero cups is equivalent to zero pastries. But I’m not trying to do maths. Maths is just part of my identity."
I didn’t use to be like this. I used to be like most of the population: numbers were vaguely threatening, ‘maths’ was something you used in school but probably never anywhere else, and statistics were a tool used by politicians to con the populace.
My mathematical ‘awakening’ came when I was nineteen years old and studying philosophy. While exploring the very real, human experience of the passing of time, I realised that this supposedly vague concept could be described, evaluated and tested not just in traditional language, but in a uniquely expressive and symbolic language – mathematics. Imagine: you can actually write equations that explain why time goes forward, and not backwards!
To be clear, I didn’t have the mathematical knowledge to be able to do that at nineteen. But the very realisation that it might be possible changed my mindset about what mathematics was. I came to believe that mathematics provides a beautiful and elegant way of thinking about the world, that my days are richer and more interesting for having this additional lens on the world, and that instilling a love of mathematics in all of us is valuable in and of itself.
Most of the kids in our classrooms don’t believe those things. Hell, most of the adults in our world don’t believe them. “I’m not a maths person”. “Maths is mostly for boys”. “I was never good at maths”. “Maths doesn’t make sense”.
Maths Pathway rages against this every day. We came into existence to rage against it – and yes, I’m using the word “rage” intentionally. How as educators, politicians, philanthropists and society-at-large can we accept this level of discomfort, of anxiety, of sheer terror when it comes to maths? By far the majority of our children finish school never really understanding maths; never seeing what is beautiful about it, what is exciting about it, what is powerful about it. The mission of the teachers, students, parents, schools and partners who are part of the Maths Pathway community is to ensure that the next generation sees all of that. We’re going to ensure they walk into maths class and feel like this is the best part of the day.
What will success look like? Nothing less than a world that, for the first time in human history, understands and is entirely comfortable with mathematics. It will be a world that most of us won’t even recognise – a population that can’t be manipulated by ‘statistics’, that can solve even the most intractable social and scientific problems, whose interactions with each other are rich, deep and thoughtful.
The Education Advisory Board is a select group of education experts, who contribute to the ongoing innovation and refinement of Maths Pathway’s mathematics learning and pedagogy.

A member of the physics research group that discovered the Higgs Boson, Justin swapped his research career for one in teaching. Now, he dedicates his talents to changing the terrible truth that he experienced as a classroom teacher: despite teachers’ best efforts, too many students were graduating with little to no understanding of mathematics. At the Maths Pathway office, Justin works tirelessly to ensure the Learning and Teaching Model is translated into the best possible tools, content and classroom routines. Justin lives and breathes innovation and will leave no stone unturned in the search to help teachers maximise the impact they have on students.
Mati taught high school mathematics and physics for 12 years. Her passion is to create a mathematics curriculum that is fun and engaging for all students, that challenges them and helps them to develop a love for the subject.
Previously a particle physicist working in the Higgs Boson group, Joel loved the Maths Pathway vision and joined the team when it was run out of Richard’s shed.
Laura has a passion for learning analytics and how data can enable better practice. She has led multiple teams over the works and has worked in partnership with schools to help them deliver better learning outcomes.
