Plus your routine elevated thanks to:
The deodorant is a nice surprise 
"The shampoo works great and foams well too. The deodorant is a nice surprise too. As a man, it was important. It proves its worth throughout the day. I also really like the chic and practical toothbrush." 
 "For a solid shampoo, it foams really well. My hair is soft. I also really like the fresh and discrete scent. You gained a loyal customer." 
The greenology's shampoo formula works super well 
"The soap is very pleasant, very gentle on the skin, it does not dry out. I love the fragrances of the products. I was a little apprehensive about applying the deodorant and it was really easy, so the choice was quickly made for me. The shampoo foams super well after previous not very convincing experiences with solid shampoos, I have to admit that the greenology formula works super well" 
I really believe in your products' future 
"I'm super happy because I haven't used shampoo for a while, just conditioner because with my hair, it is not a good idea (drying out). I used greenology shampoo and conditioner and had great result. Your products really have a future, I really believe in it now that I've tested them." 
"The shampoo is great. It washes really well, foams well and I already have the impression that my hair gets oily less quickly." 
"I use the soap daily. Your shampoo is great too. I can already say that my favorite product is the moisturizer, it smells amazing! I also love the greenology's scent. It's great to have a typical scent associated with your brand." 
"I gave my boyfriend the greenology deodorant. He adores it. He's a sportsman so that's cool." 
"I love the whole range. The textures are smooth and the use is natural and obvious. I immediately liked the perfumes. You can officially count me among your early adopters." 
5% OF OUR BENEFICES DONATED TO NATAGORA
Why switching to a greenology routine makes a real difference
90% of trash found in the ocean comes from plastic pollution. Not all plastic can be recycled and even if it could most of it isnâ€™t.
Close to 552 million shampoo bottles end up in landfills every year, add to those the shower gel bottles, the deodorant containers, the toothbrushes and even the cotton buds.
This represents tons of plastic that we could prevent from getting in our oceans. Our behavior has an impact on the environnement as well as on our health. We can still make a difference by starting to tweak our daily habits.

greenology is the project of two young women from Belgium, Anne-So the communication director and ChloÃ© the web developer.
Weâ€™ve known each other for over 10 years now, we studied together back at university. We have the same bachelor and master degrees, Communication and Political Science.
After that Anne-So worked at the Brussels Region as a political communicator while ChloÃ© moved to Seattle where she learned to code.
Our life paths, although quite different those past few years, led us both to become aware of environmental issues like pollution due to plastic packaging and public health issues like endocrine disruptors carried by chemicals contained in food and hygiene products.
Our goal is clear, creating an eco-conscious and affordable daily routine which lets you take better care of you and the planet.
If you are aware of the environmental and health challenges but do not always know where to start to stay clean without getting the planet dirty, 
 is for you. Join the movement, ditch plastic,Â  join greenology.

We are happy to be plastic free
Each kit lasting up to 3 months prevent the production of 12 plastic containers, 1 plastic toothbrush and 90 Q-tips. Over one year it adds up to 48 plastic containers, 4 toothbrushes and 360 Q-tips. Beyond the absence of plastic bottles, we focused on the idea of â€‹â€‹having no unnecessary packaging for the transport and delivery of our products.
Parts of greenology solids are handmade in Latvia where we carefully selected our manufacturer. All our products were developed in close collaboration with their chemists to be super clean and still efficient and nice to use.
Some small batches of body care are also handmade here in Brussels by Anne-So & ChloÃ©.
Â We are proud to be cruelty free & veganÂ 
At greenology, taking care of you and the planet is one of our essential missions. It goes without saying that taking care of animals while preserving their status as sensitive beings is just as important. We can guarantee 100% cruelty-free & vegan products.
Thanks to our solid routine you can avoid wasting plastic containers that would end up in our oceans. We also prevent harmful chemicals present in classical cleansing products to get into rivers and pollute our ecosystems.
All green everything on the INCI analyzers
While developing our formulas with our chemists, we made sure to only use safe and good ingredients both for you and our planet. We used the INCI Beauty website to check that all our products are beyond reproach.
The content of the starter kit is designed to fit in an envelope and go into mailboxes so that postmen can deliver it directly during their daily round. Youâ€™ll never need to worry about not being home or have to run to a parcel depot to get your kit!
This also makes our delivery carbon neutral since we are using existing networks and preventing additional trips.
Our body cares are solid thus it takes a lot less water to produce them. Indeed, using our solid products represents an 80% water saving compared to liquid options. Solid options also rinse much faster than liquid ones. Your hygiene is essential, as is water. Taking care of both is possible with greenology.
For each kit sold, we make a donation to 
 to protect 1mÂ² of nature. Their mission is to create preserves where our wildlife and flora can develop freely again.
Planting trees is good but itâ€™s even better to restore original local habitats.
Our shared vision gave us the will to launch the 
A movement based on the 3 pillars of sustainable development :
ecology of desire with measurable impact on the environment
Purchasing power should not be an obstacle to ecological transition.
The economy must finally serve the socio-environmental and not the other way around. The economy can no longer be content to create wealth, it must reinvent itself by changing society towards achievable socio-environmental objectives.
In order to do our part,
Â we work to raise awareness and inspire, by offering you an eco-responsible, vegan, innovative, easy, pleasant and affordable solution to take care of you and our planet.
 is our answer to the plastic and chemical pollution. greenology is also our answer to allergens, irritants and other endocrine disruptors poisoning us little by little every day.
We offer an all-in-one solution, zero plastic and zero harmful chemical without guilt and hassle : a kit containing all the body care essentials you simply need to stay fresh and clean.
By providing a valuable alternative to plastic, 
 is positioning itself as your life partner in the ecological transition, first step in your bathroom!
From experience, we are deeply convinced : we can make a difference by tweaking our daily consumption habits without paying a high price. Itâ€™s far from being 
 and itâ€™s also the butterfly effect.
And donâ€™t forget, the best waste is the one we donâ€™t produce.
Be part of the solution, not the pollution.

 : in its original bag, or any waterproof pouch, a small glass or metal jar.
aybe youâ€™ve noticed the soap changed between the first photoshoot and now : itâ€™s darker because we adapted the formula to make it palm oil free to be as sustainable as possible.

Â : directly after the shower, apply it with your index finger on your armpits.
 : keep it tightly closed in its original jar.
 : if this is a very first use, your armpits may need some time to adjust, like any transition. Even if an impression of loss of efficiency appears at the beginning, it is completely normal. Your armpits need to get rid of the chemicals blocking your pores present in regular deodorants.
 : heat it in your hands. Then massage gently on your body. Renew if necessary. Best to use before bed to wake up with a silky skin or just after your shower when the skin is not completely dry.

Pourquoi choisir greenology fait une vraie diffÃ©rence
90% des dÃ©chets prÃ©sents dans nos ocÃ©ans sont issus de la production de plastique. 
Tous les plastiques ne peuvent pas Ãªtre recyclÃ©s et mÃªme sâ€™ils le pouvaient, la plupart ne le sont pas.
PrÃ¨s de 552 millions de bouteilles de shampoing finissent chaque annÃ©e dans les dÃ©charges, sans oublier les bouteilles de gel douche, les stick dÃ©odorants, les brosses Ã  dents et mÃªme les cotons-tiges.
Tout cela reprÃ©sente des tonnes de plastique qui asphyxient notre planÃ¨te. 
Notre comportement bouleverse notre environnement tout comme notre santÃ©.
Nous pouvons vraiment faire la diffÃ©rence avec des gestes simples appliquÃ©s au quotidien.

De deodorant is een aangename verrassing 
"De shampoo werkt erg goed en schuimt ook goed. De deodorant is ook een leuke verrassing. Als man was het belangrijk. Het bewijst zich de hele dag door. Ik vind de tandenborstel ook erg leuk, stijlvol en praktisch." 
 "Voor een vaste shampoo schuimt het erg goed. Mijn haar is zacht. Ik hou ook erg van de frisse en discrete geur. U krijgt een trouwe klant." 
De greenology shampoo formule super goed werkt 
"De zeep is zeer aangenaam, zeer zacht voor de huid, hij droogt niet uit. Ik hou van de geuren van de producten. Ik was een beetje ongerust over het aanbrengen van de deodorant en het was heel gemakkelijk, dus de keuze was snel voor mij gemaakt. De shampoo schuimt super goed na andere niet erg overtuigende ervaringen met vaste shampoos, ik moet toegeven dat de greenology formule super goed werkt." 
"Ik ben super blij want ik heb al een tijdje geen shampoo meer gebruikt, alleen conditioner want met mijn haar is het geen goed idee (uitdrogen). Ik gebruikte greenology shampoo en conditioner en had een geweldig resultaat. Jullie producten hebben echt een toekomst, daar geloof ik echt in nu ik ze heb getest." 
"De shampoo is geweldig. Het wast heel goed, schuimt goed en ik heb nu al de indruk dat mijn haar minder snel vettig wordt." 
Ik hou van de geur van greenology 
"I use the soap daily. Your shampoo is great too. I can already say that my favorite product is the moisturizer, it smells amazing! I also love the greenology's scent. It's great to have a typical scent associated with your brand." 
Mijn vriend is dol op de deodorant 
"Ik heb mijn vriend de deodorant Greenology gegeven. Hij is er dol op. Hij is een sportman, dus dat is cool." 
Ik hou van het hele assortiment 
"Ik hou van het hele assortiment. De texturen zijn glad en het gebruik is natuurlijk en duidelijk. Ik vond de parfums meteen lekker. U mag mij officieel tot uw early adopters rekenen."

Waarom greenology een echt verschil maakt
90% van het afval in de oceaan is afkomstig van de plasticproductie.
Niet al het plastic is recycleerbaar, en niet al het recycleerbare plastic wordt hergebruikt.
Elk jaar belanden zoâ€™n 552 miljoen shampooflessen op het stort, daarbij komen dan nog de douchegelflesjes, de deodorant sticks, de tandenborstels en zelfs de wattenstaafje.
Dit vertegenwoordigt kiloâ€™s plastic die onze planeet verstikken.
Ons gedrag heeft een enorme impact op het milieu en op onze gezondheid.
We kunnen echt het verschil maken door onze dagelijkse gewoontes aan te passen.
