Exclusively designed for Salty Aura. Can be used as a picnic rug, beach blanket, to brighten up your quilt cover, or to keep warm. You soon won't be able to live without these throw rugs!
These Designs are all made with 100% Recycled cotton from pre-consumer waste. This means that all fabric cutoffs from other brands' apparel, are shredded and re-spun back into yarn. 
By recycling material that already exists, we are saving tens of thousands of litres of water by not having to grow new cotton.

What are the care instructions for the rugs?
Spot clean when possible. Hand wash in cold, soapy water and hang to dry. Avoid harsh detergents and fabric softness. Avoid machine washing, but If its necessary use a delicate cycle. The rug may shrink 10% once washed, but will expand again after use. They soften with each wash like other throw blankets. The rugs are woven, so be careful when using around sharp objects (pointy rings, car keys etc) so you don't pull any threads. Some people use them on the ground to brighten up their room, however please don't vacuum the rugs.
