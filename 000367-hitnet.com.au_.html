Hitnet brings information and services to the hardest-to-reach people in the world
Hitnet brings information and services to the hardest to reach people in the world.
As organisations continue to shift their services online, particularly in response to COVID-19, Hitnet breaks down barriers to provide connection, access and information to the half of the world who are digitally excluded.
Hitnet enables a digital ecosystem that can provide opportunity and prosperity for people living in remote locations and welcomes the Australian Government’s Closing the Gap Target 17 “By 2026, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have equal levels of digital inclusion”.
Mobile data is expensive, and health content can be private and personal. With the Hitnet mobile app and using the Community WiFi, users can download their content to watch and re-watch later at home.
Our touchscreen Hubs, both indoor and outdoor, help people to connect, be informed and engaged with the digital economy through curated and frequently updated content.
Hitnet Wi-Fi Hotspots enable the digital ecosystem around the Hitnet Hubs and act as an on-ramp to the digital world. Free for mobile phone users, they guide inexperienced users to curated websites and apps.
We know that there is a difference between simply providing access to content and actually making content accessible. This is why we work with our clients and communities to co-create the content.
Our work has a clear focus on digitally excluded and marginalised communities around the world. Hitnet’s digital platform is co-designed with the communities we’re located in. 
In June 2021, Hitnet and ThoughtWorks were finalists and Merit Award winners at the NSW State iAwards for the development of the innovative Hitnet Mobile App.

Hitnet brings information and services to the hardest-to-reach people in the world
Hitnet has been working with First Nations communities for the past 20 years. We began as an action research project within the University of Queensland, based in Cairns. 
Pilot projects in remote Cape York showed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would access touchscreen technology to seek health information. Various rounds of state and federal government funding were subsequently secured, and Hitnet rolled out nationally. 
About nine years ago, Hitnet left the University and set up as an independent social business and founding Australian B Corp.
In the 21st century, so much of the information and guidance we access about health sits online. Hitnet provides access to trusted, culturally relevant health information that empowers communities to live healthy lives.
All of our content is co-created with the communities that engage with it, allowing people to see their friends, family, teachers and idols in the content they consume on the screen. Every Hitnet Hub can also upload their own content to the ‘My Place’ channel that stays within their own community.
Being digitally included is vital to young people. Our work connects young people to education, jobs and opportunities beyond the geographical boundaries of their community. It allows them to grow, aspire and prosper.
Digital technologies play a central and empowering role in our lives; and now, with many vital services and programs being based online, digital inclusion means social inclusion more than ever. Our services support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to access the digital world, safely and successfully.
We approach all our interactions with compassion and acceptance. We’re generous with our knowledge, ideas and connections, as our partners are with us.
The stories and information we share through our Community Hubs tackle serious problems but with a playful approach, and that’s why they leave their mark.
We’re wildly creative and inventive, and we’re always searching for new ways to advance learning. When traditional and cultural knowledge take their rightful place alongside innovative learning, our work transforms lives. 
Access via mobile devices over access via hubs/kiosks
Agency of individual users over centralised ownership and control
Sovereignty (people owning their content) over access for all
The interests of community over the interests of customers.
While technology is the backbone of our business, it’s also the key to unlocking the digital divide and to creatively engaging the next generation.
We don’t hold all the answers to the most challenging social problems, that’s why we’re dedicated to co-creating knowledge in each and every community in need.
We’ve been a proud B Corp since 2013. Recently, we were re-certified for the fourth time, and were subsequently made a ‘Best for the World’ honouree.
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. The 17 Goals interconnect and, in order to leave no one behind, it is important that we achieve each Goal by 2030.  
We identified the key Sustainable Development Goals that most closely relate to Hitnet’s work and use them to drive our activity.

Hitnet brings information and services to the hardest-to-reach people in the world
Hitnet’s products and services enable communities around the world to connect, be informed and engage with the digital economy.
To remove barriers to access, the Hitnet app is downloaded through a website URL (hitnet.app), rather than an app store.
The app houses an extensive catalogue of culturally relevant and sensitive health and social content.
To increase the opportunity for privacy, Hitnet content can be downloaded onto the app using the Hitnet WiFi. This content can then be watched later offline.
The Hitnet app can be localised, allowing for region-specific content and a community’s own ‘My Place’ channel.
A future version of the app will allow for community-relevant alerts such as for COVID-19 or natural disasters to be sent to users.
35% of Indigenous Australians in urban and regional centres are mobile-only users, and the proportion is even higher in remote communities.
The Hitnet Wi-Fi portal page can be branded for your organisation. The mobile landing page menu can be co-designed with your preference of websites and apps.
Supply your own, or we can install and supply securely and independently of your enterprise network.                                          
With your Wi-Fi installed and your landing page co-designed, we assist your digitally challenged community members to understand and safely engage with the digital world.   
Free for any mobile phone user, with easy to access mobile landing page, to guide to popular websites and apps. No logons required.
Decide what content you would like to make accessible, the amount of data per user per day, and its operating hours.
“More than 90% of Australians will need to use some level of digital skills at work within the next 5 years” Australia’s Tech Future (Australian Government, 2018).
Hitnet has an extensive catalogue of content, and the Hub content is regularly updated. Every Hub has its own ‘My Place’ channel where community content is show-cased.
Your Hub package includes delivery, installation, ongoing service and maintenance, and remote monitoring and support.
A built-in, free-to-use Wi-Fi hotspot allows users to easily download content and access essential, curated services through a Hitnet landing page.
Hubs are sold as packages that include our Australian-made hardware and warranty. Packages can be tailored to your requirements.
Max evolved from community feedback that an outdoor hub is where everybody can access him. He runs off a 12 hour battery and docks in an enclosed shelter.

Hitnet brings information and services to the hardest-to-reach people in the world
Our work reaches communities in the most remote corners of the world.
Technology for Development in the Solomon Islands
In October 2020, our solar-powered Mobile Max was launched in the Pacific nation. 
As part of DFAT’s Technology for Development Pilot Project, Mobile Tekelea & Tutuqu (named by the two host communities) display co-created content in local language and a Wifi hotspot, providing a means for these Solomons’ communities to access the digital world.
In both sites, communities took part in digital skills training, equipping local people with the skills and knowledge they need to meaningfully engage with the digital world.
Improving digital access with the Geraldton Regional Aboriginal Medical Service
The Geraldton Regional Aboriginal Medical Service (GRAMS) were seeking to distribute culturally appropriate health promotion information to their community in Western Australia, particularly around smoking cessation.
GRAMS received their indoor Community Hub with a ‘My Place Geraldton’ channel, which displayed locally produced ‘Tackling Indigenous Smoking’ stories. 
GRAMS also launched a Hitnet Wi-Fi hotspot for their community, which included a co-designed mobile landing page.
Strengthening youth mental health in North Queensland with 'Break it Down'
‘Break it Down’ is an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander youth mental health literacy program that is breaking down the stigma surrounding mental health; including grief, trauma and substance addiction.
Through our content services, we reshaped the 15 video stories from five communities into an interactive multimedia channel for the Hitnet Hubs in North Queensland and the Hitnet mobile app.
Every five years, we take the opportunity to sit down with our team and key stakeholders to reflect and plan. Our 2017-2022 drives our work as an organisation.
Every year, we love to look back on the remarkable partnerships we’ve formed, sites we’ve launched, and content we’ve co-created.
In 2016, the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Health Equity worked with Hitnet to gain an understanding of how digital connectivity impacts the health of Indigenous communities.

Bridging the digital divide during times of crisis
With most of our Hitnet Hubs in remote health services, the role we play in delivering relevant information and services has never been more vital. 
It’s amazing to reflect on the evolution of Hitnet and technology more generally, throughout the 2010’s. 
Welcome to our quarterly news. It’s great to be able to keep you up to date with our latest developments in technology, communities and impact. Thanks for taking the time to read and share.

Activating Hitnet tech, for Pacific development.
It was a real thrill when we were recently announced as winners of the inaugural Technology for Development Challenge in the Solomon Islands, by the Australian Government’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).
Mobile Max: breaking down barriers to the digital world.
Our field trial of ‘Mobile Max’ our new outdoor hub, at Alice Springs Library has come to an end. After six months of rigorous testing and use, Mobile Max survived a hotter-than-average Central Australian summer and came out with flying colours.
Testing Time for Max at Alice Springs Library.
It was with some trepidation that we flew out from Alice Springs in August having left our newest addition to the Hitnet family ‘Mobile Max’, our tough, outdoor mobile hub, in Central Australia. 
New technologies converge with ancient cultures.
This week has been a significant one for Hitnet with the culmination of many years of research and work going into developing a tough, outdoor, mobile hub. 
Mobile Max Hub is ready to roll
We’re excited to have completed the final stage of development for our outdoor Mobile Max hub. Max evolved from community feedback that access to information.
More than just bridging the digital divide
A word from our co-founder and CEO, Julie Gibson, on Hitnet’s 2017.
A new Hub for one of our most remote sites
We were really excited to head up to Ngukurr in August to launch their new Hitnet Hub in partnership with Ethos Global Foundation.
