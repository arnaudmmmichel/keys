Every month we help people at workplaces all over Australia feel valued and, quite frankly, feel fantastic.
Our practitioners provide massage for all types of events, from conferences through to sporting events.
We’re driven by a simple purpose:
helping people feel great about themselves. 
We provide world-class massage at work and events. 
Your people gain wellbeing and experience a positive culture.
But we’re more than a service of value, 
Owned and driven by Lena and Stu MacRae, Seated Massage introduced Australian businesses to the benefits of massage in the workplace back in 1993, and is now known nationwide as a purposeful and powerful force for good.
Seated Massage connects Australia’s best and brightest corporate massage practitioners with businesses of all shapes and sizes, putting workplace wellbeing in the spotlight, promoting positive workplace cultures, and modelling what it means to be a business that puts people above profit. 
Our mission is to inspire organisations to invest in the wellbeing of their people and facilitate positive social connection through office massages, and we’re guided by our belief that 
 deserves to feel valued. Workplace wellbeing doesn’t need to be complicated, airy-fairy, wishy-washy or bogged down in rhetoric. Our chair massage services are simple, and the results are tangible, and that’s why 
We’ve watched wellbeing trends come and go over the last 30 years but massage at work is more important than ever. The businesses that do the best when it comes to creating positive workplace cultures are the ones that keep workplace wellbeing simple, 
ask their team what they want
, and value and invest in people above all else.  
Every month we help people all over Australia feel valued and, quite frankly, feel fantastic. That’s the power of massage, and we come to where people need it the most: at work and out about in the community at events. 
Our practitioners provide massage in the workplace and at events for all types of businesses and organisations, from large software firms to local real estate agencies, councils and everything in between to help people unwind, reset and feel rejuvenated, physically and emotionally. 
Seated Massage options include roving office massages, table massage and our popular chair massage services. 
Which massage is right for your business?
Looking for massage for a corporate or community event? 
Stu, a qualified massage therapist, reads an article in a massage magazine about ‘corporate massage’ becoming a thing in the USA and immediately resonated with the concept. He reaches out to Charles Carcellar (who first brought corporate massage to Australia), and starts providing massage in the workplace to employees of a large IT firm in Sydney at their on-site gym.
Word-of-mouth from these employees leads to others seeking office massages, but at this point workplaces still have employees paying for the service themselves.
Stu takes over a corporate massage contract at AMP, and this was the beginning of Seated Massage providing massage in the workplace as we know it today, where businesses invest in workplace wellbeing and prioritise people and positive workplace culture.
Lena qualifies as a massage therapist and leaves behind the stressful world of advertising to join forces with Stu. They give themselves six months to see if they can turn their big dreams for their humble massage at work and chair massage services into reality.
The phone literally starts ringing the next day (when you shift your energy, the universe shows up!). We brought on board another therapist to keep up with the demand for our chair massage services, and it kept growing from there.
Within the first year, Seated Massage receives its first interstate enquiry, and is booking corporate clients across Sydney and Melbourne. By nurturing connections and spreading the word about the benefits of corporate massage, many more organisations came on board when they could see the positive impact of massage on workplace wellbeing.
Lena, and then Stu, step away from the daily provision of massage at work and start focusing on expanding Seated Massage’s positive impact, becoming the first nationwide corporate and event massage supplier of roving, table and chair massage services.
Stu and Lena hear about B Corp Certification from someone at their co-working space, who thought it perfectly aligned with the Seated Massage ethos, and begin the lengthy process of reviewing their operations and processes and being assessed by B Lab in the USA.
Seated Massage becomes the first massage service in the world to become a Certified B Corp.
Seated Massage becomes an early adopter of the GoodWell certification, an independent assessment of how transparent and ethical business’ people-practices are. This raises the bar of what it means to have a positive workplace culture and promotes workplace wellbeing 
As Seated Massage’s nationwide presence grows, Hayley joins the team as Operations Manager – with serendipitous timing as she is able to help Seated Massage navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, and develops Seated Massage’s industry-leading Safe Massage Protocol, setting the benchmark for Covid-safe massage in the workplace.
Seated Massage is Australia’s only Certified B Corp massage service, and provides massage in the workplace and at events to tens of thousands of people across Australia every year, with unparalleled customer service and massage quality.
Our practitioner partners tick all the boxes…
… but with Seated Massage, safe hands are just the start and this is what sets us apart from the rest. We’re really (really) picky about who we send to your business or event, so you’ll have one less thing to think about. 
We only partner with practitioners who live and breathe the Seated Massage values of

Work with the most respected workplace massage provider in Australia.
If scheduling individual massages isn’t realistic, roving massage gives your team an instant mood boost.
86% of our clients choose our chair massage, a fuss-free, comfortable way for your people to feel fantastic.
Give your team the gift of time. They’ll walk (or float) away from a table massage feeling valued and revitalised
Every month we help people at workplaces all over Australia feel valued and, quite frankly, feel fantastic.
Our practitioners provide massage for all types of events, from conferences through to sporting events.
We’re the first massage service in the world that’s a Certified B Corp
When we started out in 1993, we knew that in our hands (literally) we had a powerful tool to spread good, globally. Workplace massage helps build cultures of giving, and that’s a big aspect of being a B Corp in Australia.
 since 2015, and love to work with other businesses that also care about doing good on a global scale. We became a B Corp as much for our clients, their people, our practitioner base and our industry as a whole, as we did for ourselves. We encourage others in our industry and the wider business community to join us on this journey.
Out of 5,000 Certified B Corporations worldwide, we are among the top 5% of B Corps in one of the five impact areas assessed as part of the certification process! We are proud to be one of the Best For The World™ this year and congratulate all our fellow BFTW 2022.
First up, the B stands for benefit.
B Corps are a global movement of leaders balancing purpose and profit. Companies with B Corp certification strive to be the best in the world, and the best for the world, by using business as a force for good.
As a B Corp in Australia, Seated Massage meets 
verified higher levels of transparency, accountability and social and environmental performance
. B Corps can all look quite different, but the thing they all have in common is successfully undertaking a rigorous assessment against B Corp criteria created by the non-profit B Lab based in the USA. B Corps go through the recertification process every three years, ensuring businesses maintain rigorous ethical and sustainability standards. 
It’s not easy to become a B Corp, so we encourage you to support the B Corps in your local community, as they’re paving the way for a world that cares about more than making a profit. 
What our B Corp Certification means for you
We sought B Corp Certification because we wanted to stand for something. We were already acting like a B Corp business in many ways and B Lab provided us with a way to formalise it. As trailblazers and thought leaders in the corporate wellness space, we’ve been first to market in numerous ways over the years. We’re the first massage company in the world to meet the rigorous B Corp criteria and the only massage company that’s a B Corp, Australia-wide. 
We’re proud to have received a B Impact Score of 93 in our latest re-certification assessment
Here’s what that means for you:
You have a great reason to partner with us 
We’re a supplier who is stepping up and doing more than just their job. We’re not just a service of value, we’re a service steeped in values. There’s a big difference between us and other corporate massage providers. We’re not just focused on profit: we’re the ethical choice.
You can trust that we do what we say we do 
B Corp Certification formally recognises the good we do through our social and environmental impact, and is built into all levels of our operations. Everything we do is through the lens of how we can contribute to the greater good within our industry, our community, and beyond.
Your people will notice the Seated Massage difference
Our massage therapists are doing meaningful work. They know that Seated Massage values them immensely, and that the impact of their work extends beyond the walls of your workplace. People who love their job perform better, so… everyone wins, including your team!
The greatest measure of our success is the impact we have on the lives of others. The good we do is in our hands.
What gives? Every massage. Your people and needy Australians both benefit from our partnership. #EveryMassageGivesTwice

Find out more about what we do
A simple desire to make a difference in peoples’ lives. That’s what drives Stu – it underpins everything he does at Seated Massage, and he’s known for his unwavering care for people and for going out of his way to help someone or support a cause. The Seated Massage ‘ideas guy’ with an insatiable appetite for learning, Stu lives and breathes our mission, showing up every day for the Seated Massage team, clients and community with integrity, compassion and the quiet enthusiasm that has helped corporate workplace massage become commonplace around Australia.
Stu loves to still get out and drop into workplaces and events, spending time and sharing the benefits of professional massage with clients. He says that despite everything Seated Massage has achieved, his career highlight remains seeing the smiles on people’s faces after they’ve had a massage. Recognised as an OG corporate massage therapist, Stu places a huge value on social connections and life experience. His ability to connect with people from all walks of life, from those he meets out and about through to his executive suite clients, plays a pivotal role in his passion for running Seated Massage as a force for good in the world.
Although Stu views Seated Massage as a ‘lifestyle choice’ not a job, when he isn’t at work you’ll find him studying breathwork, trail running in the Adelaide Hills, and dreaming of being in Bali while listening to gamelan music on Spotify!
The purpose of life is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.
Lena’s passion for providing meaningful work to the wonderful corporate massage therapists we engage, and authentic relationships with businesses striving to cultivate a caring culture has been central to Seated Massage becoming such a force for good. Having worked in the world of advertising for many years before taking up the challenge of improving wellbeing in the workplace, Lena is a wealth of knowledge for businesses looking to combat the health and productivity challenges that come with long hours, tough deadlines and the pressure that’s prevalent in workplaces of all shapes and sizes.
Lena is warm and approachable, and her understanding of how corporate workplace massage fits in the bigger picture of wellbeing AND broader strategy allows her to help business owners and event organisers efficiently implement the right massage services for their needs. Lena loves that she does something wonderful every day: creating feel-good experiences for people that make a difference, both physically and mentally. Always open to new ideas, and forever on the lookout for ways that Seated Massage can better serve the community, Lena’s dedication to lifting the culture and mental health within the corporate world has firmly established her as a thought leader in the Australian massage industry. 
While Lena gets a buzz from talking to clients and sensing their smiles through their voices as they talk about their massages, in her downtime she’s an avid reader, enjoys discovering new eateries with family and friends, and is currently chipping away at hiking the Heysen Trail, one section at a time.
Fall down seven times, get up eight.
As the Seated Massage Operations Manager, Hayley’s responsible for keeping everything running like clockwork, overseeing the coordination of Seated Massage’s nation-wide network of practitioners and clients. As a Certified B Corp, Seated Massage constantly strives for excellence in its internal operations and for our broader impact socially and environmentally.  Hayley’s ability to observe and analyse complex situations and turn business ideas into actuality plays a pivotal role in Seated Massage’s ever-evolving strategy to make a positive impact on the world. She makes sure we perform to our highest potential, internally and in our wider impact. 
Hayley loves being part of a like-minded community that really cares for people and wants to improve the lives of others. Watching Seated Massage and our clients’ businesses develop, grow and flourish is hugely rewarding for Hayley, and she firmly believes that reaching people through corporate workplace massage is an impactful and meaningful way to contribute to the greater mental health of the world. 
When she isn’t keeping Stu and Lena in line at work and finding logical solutions for their larger-than-life ideas, Hayley loves going to restaurants with her husband, and can’t wait to travel and visit new places again – but for now, you can find her reading, at a barre fitness class or out on a long walk. 
If you don’t know what you’re here to do, then just do some good.
If chair massage certification ever becomes available for doggos, you can bet that Poppy would start doing zoomies and be first in line. As a lap-dog extraordinaire, this would be right up her alley! 
Poppy’s a fluffy ball of cute and calm in the Seated Massage HQ, and loves spending her day working with (*ahem* sleeping on the lap of) her favourite human, Lena while she talks to clients. 
As a rescue dog, Poppy pays it forward bringing unbridled joy, peace and unconditional love to her family and any human who has the good fortune to meet her.

What our calibre of practitioners means for our clients
Your people deserve the best, so that’s what we give you. We 
our massage therapy practitioners are the best in the biz Australia-wide
, and that’s why 85% of our clients book repeat services. 
Many corporate massage services operate more like a delivery service than a customised wellbeing program. 
 We’re picky: our massage therapy practitioners go through in-depth training and screening before we bring them onboard. We’re the first nation-wide supplier of corporate massage, but still the most personalised, so you can trust that we only send practitioners who are a good fit for your business/event.
Our massage therapists are doing meaningful work across Australia.
Our massage therapists love what they do, and know that the impact of their work extends beyond the walls of your workplace. People who love their job perform better, so… everyone wins, including your team!
“I first joined the Seated Massage team in early 2005. During my 17 years of working with Lena and Stu, I’ve always felt welcomed and valued within their network of practitioners. They have exceptional attention to detail with every job, making sure that not only is the client getting an amazing massage service but also the staff are working in a fabulous supported team working environment as well.
They always strive to be the best in the industry while maintaining the highest quality standards in their business practices and in their personal ethics of wanting to help create a better planet for all. Their commitment to reducing their carbon footprint and their initiatives with providing meals for those in need through OzHarvest is commendable. I’ve loved every 17 years  of working with these awesome people and I look forward to many, many more.”
We love to hear from passionate, values-based and purpose-driven massage therapy practitioners.
