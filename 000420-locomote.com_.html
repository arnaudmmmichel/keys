How does a corporate travel management company work?
A travel management company (TMC) is designed to assist your business travel program with the day-to-day operations, including travel booking and traveller safety. A good TMC can provide your company with software for all of your travel program's stakeholders, including travellers, their managers, and your finance team. Working with a TMC can improve the efficiency of your travel program.
How are we different from other business travel companies?
Most business travel providers are the same. Locomote is a technology-led and experience focused travel software that brings together industry leading technology, support, expertise, experience into a single platform - 
visit our "difference page" to find out more.
What are some of the common tasks of corporate travel consultants?
Business travel coordinators are ready to assist you with travel bookings, changes, and cancellations. They can search inventory across multiple suppliers through a global distribution system (GDS), allowing them to find the best business travel options quickly. Travel agents typically field support requests via phone, email, and in-app chat. They can also pull up airline and hotel policies to clarify the options when a traveler is considering changing their business travel itinerary.
What is a travel management platform?
A travel management platform (like Locomote) is the technology that automates and streamlines corporate travel management. Allowing employees to book business travel within budget, help managers approve and review non compliant travel requests and help the finance team gain visibility into budget management and forecasting.
How do corporate travel booking companies make money?
Travel management companies (TMCs) may make money through a commission earned on travel bookings or by charging a booking fee. A great TMC saves clients money through negotiated discounts and a reduction in the time it takes to book, manage and reschedule trips. This more than covers the cost of using a TMC.
Locomote is proud to be a certified B Corpâ¢ï¸. A business that strives to be a force for good. By meeting the highest standards of social and environmental performance and transparency, we're continuing to design a better world.

How does a travel management company work?
A travel management company (TMC) is designed to assist your business travel program with the day-to-day operations, including travel booking and traveller safety. A good TMC can provide your company with technology for all of your travel program's stakeholders, including travellers, their managers, and your finance team. Working with a TMC can improve the efficiency of your travel program.
How are we different from other travel agencies?
Most business travel agencies are the same. Locomote is a technology-led and experience focused travel company that brings together industry leading technology, support, expertise, experience into a single platform - 
visit our "difference page" to find out more.
What are some of the common tasks of travel agents?
Travel agents are ready to assist you with travel bookings, changes, and cancellations. They can search inventory across multiple suppliers through a global distribution system (GDS), allowing them to find the best business travel options quickly. Travel agents typically field support requests via phone, email, and in-app chat. They can also pull up airline and hotel policies to clarify the options when a traveler is considering changing their business travel itinerary.
What is a travel management platform?
A travel management platform (like Locomote) is the technology that automates and streamlines corporate travel management. Allowing employees to book business travel within budget, help managers approve and review non compliant travel requests and help the finance team gain visibility into budget management and forecasting.
How do travel management companies make money?
Travel management companies (TMCs) may make money through a commission earned on travel bookings or by charging a booking fee. A great TMC saves clients money through negotiated discounts and a reduction in the time it takes to book, manage and reschedule trips. This more than covers the cost of using a TMC.

We had challenges with our previous provider, but Locomote made business travel much more efficient and cost-effective for us. 
Founded in Australia in 2012, Bondi Sands is a self-tanning product line that includes suncare, skincare, and cosmetic products that have taken the Australian and international markets by storm.Â
