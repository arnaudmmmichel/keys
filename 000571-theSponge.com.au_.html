It’s amazing what happens when you kick status quo to the curb.
The Sponge is enabling small business to focus on essential elements of marketing/strategy. I used to go in circles and best guess engagement with customers; I didn’t understand my target market. The Sponge gave me a real wake-up call: To realise how much time and money I was throwing away for no return. The learning was interesting and interactive. Now, I feel in control and focused.
We were in the middle of re-branding and wanted to know how better to market our product including how better to tell our story. This webinar provided practical marketing techniques, and rationale to explain the benefit of this strategy. The 'light bulb' moment for me was making the connection between the power of storytelling and marketing our brand.
Branding is a familiar concept to comms & marketing professionals like myself. But it’s often a mystery to other staff, and for brand to be authentic, unique and indispensable they all need to be on board. This training helped me clarify branding to everyone in our organisation. Now they’re all part of the brand redevelopment crew, identifying and sharing stories that resonate with our values and purpose. Thanks, Luke, for launching our journey to uncover the brand that ‘comes from within’.
The Sponge’s perceptive sensibility guarantees a perfect match between your business and its presentation to the world. They makes your values, ethics, goals, and the 'feel' of your business shine through every aspect of your brand.
I recommend The Sponge’s services to new and established organizations who are looking to differentiate themselves from the “ordinary” and stand out from the crowd.
One of Luke’s talents is his ability to move people and organizations from the creative to the innovative, commercializing ideas and inventions.
I have had The Sponge involved in several IT based projects over my years working as a Software Developer. Each project has seen results that have exceeded expectations and I highly recommend them.
I usually don’t believe in one stop shops, because of the inability to be great across many areas, but The Sponge truly are the one stop shop for brand creation, innovation and lead generation.
Luke and the crew at the Sponge helped set up our Corporate image as it stands today. They were extremely helpful and patient. They took the time to understand our business and brainstormed with us some of the essential elements and came up with various images until we were happy with the final one. Can't recommend Luke and his team enough. Thanks again Luke.
The Sponge team are great to work with. They translate your ideas and vision into something real and tangible and they truly want to make an impact to your business strategy with their valuable insights. We have been using them for over 10 years and would highly recommend their expertise.
William, Thyme & Prophet / Report Factory
A great vibe and energy brought to every project that The Sponge have led for me. Easy to work with, quick on the uptake of direction and prompt service. Will definitely be using The Sponge again and highly recommend.
High level strategic thinking and their creativity makes them stand out. Quick turn around time and reasonable price make them the winner every single time.
Awesome company with awesome creativity. After working with them over 2 years, The Sponge has successfully turned me from a happy customer into a raving fan!
Great creative proactive company. Could not be happier with the works they both provided and suggested. Now our go to company for branding.
Awesome design. Easy to work with. Jobs are completed quickly. Highly recommended.
Luke and the team at the Sponge are truly artisans of their craft. They're AWARE, they DARE and DELIVER.
Love their vision, love their work and mostly love the team!
The Sponge truly immersed themselves into our business, our team and our culture to develop a brand that not only captured our essence but more importantly; expressed it to the world.
The Sponge have been outstanding to work with. Their expertise, dedication and outstanding quality of work is second to none. I am grateful for their input into the design of our brand and website.
Our brand looks better than we could have dreamed and The Sponge team managed to squeeze so much meaning into it that our prospects really get a sense of how we can help them.

meta title:New Book: Impact Brand Storytelling
meta description:N/A

A How To Guide For Businesses Hell-bent On Changing The World 
Does your brand story create resistance, or does it resonate for your audience (and convert like crazy)?
I was compelled to write this book because I have met many great founders who too are hell-bent on changing the world. I notice a lot of them have one problem in common: They suck at brand storytelling! I’ll rephrase that more constructively. Their brand stories need structure and an impact overhaul. 
Impact Brand Storytelling Is All About Real Human Connection
                        Human connection happens when your brand story has impact ingrained. And when it has authenticity. Helping organisations craft their impact brand story is the work that sets me on fire. My team and I choose to work with businesses that have positive social or environmental impacts. Or those who intend to, and so they come on that journey with us. And of course they should also want to grow (or generate) healthy profits. 
As an agency, we can only help so many clients directly. And I want ALL founders hell-bent on changing the world to have an impact brand story that helps them achieve their goals, not hinder them. That’s why I wrote this book!
I want to show you the exact impact brand story model I developed through trial and error for The Sponge. And the same one we use with all our clients. It will help you find and tell your authentic impact brand story, anchored on a foundation that builds an awesome culture. And that gives you a tribe of die-hard fans.
I want this for you. That is what this book is for.
"Just a quick note to say I've been reading your book - love how you can pack such powerful meaning into simple sentences. Am a bit in awe. Go you!"
"I picked up Luke’s book as we are rebranding our business and we wanted to build in an impact model to show our team and future clients what we stood for. In the past we have made charitable donations but it certainly didn’t feel as if we were part of the overall solution to the problems that the charities were helping to alleviate. This was a problem for our team as we didn’t feel like we were doing as much as we could. Luke’s book gave me a new perspective on impact models and showed me the layers that you need to address to get them right (I.e ‘bolting in’ not ‘bolting on’ the model, ensuring that there were synergies with brand purpose and the nature of our business etc). It’s a short, sharp lesson in what to do and what to think about when it comes to assessing how your brand can do more good in the world. Since reading the book we have established a clear vision for what we want to achieve as a business to help with social issues in our community. We can’t wait to roll out our impact model as part of our rebranding over the next few months thanks to the advice in the book!"
"Easy and quick read but with lots of exercises/workshops so it's a book that is most valuable when referred back to again and again. Great tool as I start my own small business... and most likely in the future as I grow too! Nice bonus offer at the end too :)"

My Serendipitous Introduction to B Corp
In May 2016 an author friend (thanks Drew) asked me if I was familiar with B Corporations after I shared a project I had conceived to change the world
The idea centres around a new rating system and standard for businesses. One that is more about people and positive impact than making shareholders wealthy. If you’re guessing it’s 
Here I was, creating my own model from scratch, feeling alone in the quest and making slow headway. Then I got the serendipitous introduction to 
. They are the non profit who created and assesses B Corps.
What I found in B Labs was a group of people who think about business in a similar way to me
. After meeting some awesome B Corp business folks, I felt I had found my community.
The standards resonated ferociously for The Sponge.
 It was a no brainer to make the commitment. So we completed the B Impact Assessment and officially became certified in January 2017!
Being a Certified B Corp means we meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance.
It’s much more than that though! I thought as a relatively small branding agency it would be plain sailing to tick all the boxes and get certified. But there were significant internal changes to be made and processes to be improved for us to qualify.
The process united our team around our somewhat unspoken purpose to do more good in this world.
Due to spending the time on it, it built the momentum we needed to expand on it and evolve our purpose, vision and values too. You know how much I like purpose, but it is rare that we stop to work on our own business. More on that in a future piece.
What It Means For The Sponge
Being a B Corp now guides decisions about our projects, and who we choose to do business with.
Specifically, we choose to work with clients and projects that are socially responsible, ethical, and environmentally sustainable. And those that have a positive impact too!
The Sponge still specialise in purposeful brand stories, branding, and marketing for businesses. We soak it all in, and squeeze out the goodness.
We now consciously look for ways to reduce our wake
. Whether that be by cutting electricity consumption, to commissioning smaller commercial print runs. The future (a goal at the time of writing) includes Tesla company cars and solar infrastructure to keep them charged. 🙂
A Bright B Corp Inspired Future
Being a B Corp lights up our team
It is our clear commitment to better the world
, and today this is so important for us. Our team have committed to the business more than ever before.
As a newbie in the B Corp community, we are excited to see what our future holds. Having had meaningful conversations with amazing B Corps already, the prospect of over 2000 is very exciting!
There are sure to be many more priceless conversations and we look forward to inspiring others and growing with B Corp.

It’s amazing what happens when you kick status quo to the curb.
The Sponge is enabling small business to focus on essential elements of marketing/strategy. I used to go in circles and best guess engagement with customers; I didn’t understand my target market. The Sponge gave me a real wake-up call: To realise how much time and money I was throwing away for no return. The learning was interesting and interactive. Now, I feel in control and focused.
We were in the middle of re-branding and wanted to know how better to market our product including how better to tell our story. This webinar provided practical marketing techniques, and rationale to explain the benefit of this strategy. The 'light bulb' moment for me was making the connection between the power of storytelling and marketing our brand.
Branding is a familiar concept to comms & marketing professionals like myself. But it’s often a mystery to other staff, and for brand to be authentic, unique and indispensable they all need to be on board. This training helped me clarify branding to everyone in our organisation. Now they’re all part of the brand redevelopment crew, identifying and sharing stories that resonate with our values and purpose. Thanks, Luke, for launching our journey to uncover the brand that ‘comes from within’.
The Sponge’s perceptive sensibility guarantees a perfect match between your business and its presentation to the world. They makes your values, ethics, goals, and the 'feel' of your business shine through every aspect of your brand.
I recommend The Sponge’s services to new and established organizations who are looking to differentiate themselves from the “ordinary” and stand out from the crowd.
One of Luke’s talents is his ability to move people and organizations from the creative to the innovative, commercializing ideas and inventions.
I have had The Sponge involved in several IT based projects over my years working as a Software Developer. Each project has seen results that have exceeded expectations and I highly recommend them.
I usually don’t believe in one stop shops, because of the inability to be great across many areas, but The Sponge truly are the one stop shop for brand creation, innovation and lead generation.
Luke and the crew at the Sponge helped set up our Corporate image as it stands today. They were extremely helpful and patient. They took the time to understand our business and brainstormed with us some of the essential elements and came up with various images until we were happy with the final one. Can't recommend Luke and his team enough. Thanks again Luke.
The Sponge team are great to work with. They translate your ideas and vision into something real and tangible and they truly want to make an impact to your business strategy with their valuable insights. We have been using them for over 10 years and would highly recommend their expertise.
