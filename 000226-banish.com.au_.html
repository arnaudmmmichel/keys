In 2018, I made a long list of new years resolutions but to my surprise and great delight, one of them actually stuck. I made it so broad and so lax that it couldn't not work was "to reduce my waste and be kinder to the planet." Simple right? 
It was so much harder than I thought. Firstly I struggled to find credible information for people who like me were just getting started. Secondly, when I did find what I thought was the right information it was hard to find. And finally, when I decided to order six stainless steel straws online they came individually wrapped in plastic, sigh. So rather than be disheartened, I saw an opportunity. The opportunity to help Australians reduce their waste with trusted products and even better information.
Education is at the forefront of everything that I do in order to positively impact the habits of individuals and larger organisations. The Banish website and social media account is full of sustainability information, from how-to guides on composting to advice on planet-friendly food choices.
I also run BRAD – the Banish Recycling and Disposal Program. People send in hard-to-recycle items, such as blister packs, and we partner with Australian recyclers to have them recycled onshore.
The BRAD initiative recycled 11 tonnes of waste, or 150,000 products, from 11,000 households within its first 20 months.
In 2020, I delivered a TEDx talk – 
The Power of Community in Fighting Climate Change
. In 2021 and 2022 I was named as one of Australia's Top 50 People in E-Commerce and won Business NSW Sydney Metro Young Entrepreneur of the Year with Banish taking out the Sustainable Excellence award and winning overall Business of the Year.
I have most recently been named 2023 NSW Young Australian of the Year for my work educating Australians on how to live more sustainably.

At Banish we're fortunate to have an amazing team who work tirelessly behind the scenes to provide our community with the best experience possible.
What's your favourite part of your job?
I love that no two days are ever the same but my favourite part would have to be getting out in communities educating and talking to people about how they can reduce their waste, recycle better and be a more conscious consumer.
How long is a piece of string! If I had to choose one product, right now it would be the 
. Composting was something as an apartment dweller I never thought possible but once I started (thanks 
!) it made the biggest impact on reducing my landfill bin. This compost bin also looks great on my kitchen bench and is a great conversation starter.
What is something that you wish everyone knew about sustainable living? 
Don't compare yourself to anyone else. We're all on our own journeys and we're all doing our best. It's a marathon not a sprint, just keep going!
Lore, Customer Service and Lottie's EA
In your own words what does your role at Banish entail?
I am an assistant and customer service guru. I am responsible for any admin tasks that Lottie needs help with, from managing emails, adding/editing content on our website, helping with any customer service questions and managing social media posts.
What's your favourite part of your job?
My favourite part of my job is answering all of the emails. Aside from helping customers with their concerns, I also get to learn so many new things about recycling and sustainable living that I can apply in my daily life!
My favourite sustainable swap are the 
. I am an outdoorsy person, I love trekking and travelling so it's a go-to for me :)
What is something that you wish everyone knew about sustainable living? 
One crucial aspect of sustainable living that I wish everyone knew is the cumulative impact of small, everyday choices. Sustainable living isn't just about big, dramatic changes; it's about the collective effect of millions of individuals making mindful choices.
In your own words, what does your role at Banish entail?
My role at Banish changes every day, and that’s what I love about it! I assist with the digital marketing for Banish and the BRAD Program, assist & educate customers and workshop participants, pack our online orders and look after the store. I also proudly co-parent the Hub’s indoor plants. 
What’s your favourite part of your job?
I tell her constantly, but I love working alongside and learning from Lottie. She is a wealth of knowledge and experience, and her commitment to the cause and hope for a greener, cleaner future truly inspires me. I also love meeting the people that come into the Sustainability Hub, and seeing them get excited by what we’re doing at Banish. 
My favourite sustainable swap is definitely a well-insulated keep cup, like the Pargo Insulated Stainless Steel Coffee Cup. I use it all the time; coffee, tea, miso soup - you name it! It keeps things piping hot for ages, and is so handy particularly when I’m in a rush.
What is something you wish everyone knew about sustainable living?
I think a lot of people, young people particularly, can get quite disheartened about the seemingly uphill battle in front of us when it comes to protecting the planet. I wish everyone knew that the small sustainable changes you make in your day-to-day life really do add up, and are making a difference- and that there’s plenty of good happening in the world of environmentalism and sustainability. 
In your own words, what does your role at Banish entail?
I’m primarily engaged with the everyday operations of the Banish sustainability hub - which can include a lot of different things! Some of these include overseeing the shop and interacting with customers, packing online orders, managing the BRAD recycling drop offs, and preparing the space for our various workshops and talks.
What’s your favourite part of your job?
I love talking to people about their own experiences and environmental journeys. At the Central Station hub we see people from all sorts of backgrounds in the environmental space, and I love that I can help uplift people’s efforts to live more sustainably. It also means I’m always learning new things about the environmentalism and sustainable living!
One of my favourite sustainable swaps is probably period underwear. Sanitary products are an essential for all people with periods but because of their single-use nature, traditional products can create a lot of waste. Not only are period undies designed to be washed and reused (like any other piece of clothing), they’re also so much comfier than pads cause it’s just like wearing regular underwear! I love that there are different varieties based on how heavy your flow is and you can wear them overnight without fear of leaking.
What is something you wish everyone knew about sustainable living?
There isn’t one way to be sustainable. Sustainability will look different to different people depending on their access to resources, their lifestyles, and their individual values. It’s not all or nothing, so do what works for you, and leave the rest :)

For us, sustainability isn't a nice to have it is a must have. Sustainability is at our core, it is the reason why we created Banish, a place for people to learn how to live more sustainably. 
In January 2022, we officially received B Corp certification. B Corporation certification is the highest standard of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.
We launched the BRAD program in November 2020 as a way to help our community recycle their hard to recycle household items (blister packs, toothbrushes and beauty products.) The program has grow exponentially over the last 18 months, we have helped over 5,000 Australian households recycle over 5.8 tonnes of waste, or the equivalent of almost 72,000 pieces of plastic.
We want to help you outsmart the greenwashers while providing you with sustainable alternatives to help you shrink your ecological footprint.  There are countless amounts of nasties out there in many of the things we consume, way too many to keep track of for one person. For that reason, we’ve done all the hard work for you by rigorously vetting all of our suppliers and giving you full transparency behind our process. 
The sinners: BPA, Sulphates, Synthetic fragrances, Microbeads, Palm Oil, Parabens, Oxybenzone, Formaldehyde.
We choose only to partner with carbon neutral delivery services like Sendle and Australia Post. Additionally all of our Banish orders are packaged without any plastic whatsoever (no plastic post satchels, bubble wrap or sticky tape!).

Banish acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of the land where we work, the Gadigal people of the Eora nation. We pay respect to Elders - past, present and emerging - and recognise their connections to land, sea and community, with knowledge and stories that have been handed down since time immemorial. We extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and culture today.
