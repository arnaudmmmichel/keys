Yes. There is a 3-month minimum commitment per mentee. However, you can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice.Â 
What information will be shared with employers?
All information shared within the mentoring sessions remains confidential between the Mentor and the Mentee. However, program engagement and performance outcomes will be reported to the Team Manager.
Whatâs the difference between mentoring and coaching?Â 
While similar, we approach mentoring and coaching differently at esuite.Â 
In mentoring, the focus is on an individualâs personal development and progression. Mentors help Mentees find answers by asking probing questions, sharing their experiences and providing support where required. Self-discovery and reflection are a key parts of the development process. Mentoring relationships are often continuous and longer-term.
In coaching, we help businesses reach their pre-defined goals. These goals may be at a business, team and personal level. While the Coachee is responsible for executing, the Coach will bring industry expertise, connections and accountability to help accelerate the Coachee reach their goals. Coaching can be continuous or project bound.
Will you recruit my team member?Â 
At esuite, we are determined to help businesses get unexpected results by working with them to build people-powered businesses, culture-led workplaces and ambition-fuelled teams.Â 
We ensure that there is a distinct barrier between recruitment and mentoring. While we can not dissuade Mentees from applying for new roles, we guarantee that we will not approach Mentees for new roles that esuite represents.
Payment is due monthly via automated recurring payment.
