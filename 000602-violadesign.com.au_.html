About - Viola Design — Viola Design
We are Viola Design—a unique communication design studio committed to sustainability. We deliver meaning and clarity through innovative design, all the while contributing to a healthier environment.
Change for good starts with a single step. Formed in 1999 as one of the first eco-graphic design businesses, we took ours with sustainability in mind. While the designers in us see the world in CMYK, our decisions are always made through a certain shade of green – from the clients we choose to work with to the paper choices we make.
At Viola Design, we believe good design can feel as good as it does. That’s why we stick to a rigorous eco-design process. By making smart choices from inception, we can be sure that nothing leaves our studio unless it has a positive impact. From changing the conversation around women’s empowerment, to making health accessible for all, caring for our planet or kick-starting a revolution – we like to fulfil design’s prerogative in re-shaping the world we live in. So, if you’re of the same mindset, please walk with us. Design is the first step to big change.

In 1999, Anna established Viola Design as a conduit for purpose-driven work. As Design Director, she is the driving force behind the studio’s strong identity and warm client relationships. Her love of educating and motivating fellow designers and businesses about sustainable design has yielded a book or three – the most recent being 365 Nature (2015), a nature-inspired book that has been translated into ten languages. Design, sustainability, social change and photography have all taken her to the ends of the earth and back. Whether lecturing in Chile, photographing in Timor Leste or climbing Mt Kilimanjaro – Anna seeks her passions far and wide, and is always looking forward to the next adventure.
As a graphic designer, Megan’s main focus is on the creation of clear and purposeful communication. With an MA in Communication Design from RMIT she has worked at a handful of respected studios — collaborating closely with small business, government agencies, and not-for-profit organisations. She is intent on working with engaging ideas to produce thoughtful and sustainable outcomes with lasting impact.

Kasia’s inquisitive spirit has been an integral part of what makes Viola Design unique since 2008. From Melbourne to Brisbane and London, she has fine-tuned the art of designing for local context. Her rich academic background plays a significant role in informing the way she delivers her innovative communication strategies. Collaboration, curiosity, storytelling and a commitment to social justice are at the core of Kasia’s practice.
Nicholas is Viola Design’s number cruncher who helps keep the balance, somewhat literally. His attention to detail and practical outlook on life ensures each day in the studio is a constructive one. His respect for the intrinsic value of all people can be seen, and heard, in his friendly and professional approach. When he’s not keeping the books, you’ll find (or, rather, not find) Nicholas off the grid in the wilds of nature.

Sustainability - Viola Design — Viola Design
Sustainable design is smart, creative and enduring. It inspires change and is gentle on people and the planet. It is economically sustainable. Clever design uses minimum resources for maximum exposure.
Sustainability is alive in each aspect of our design process – from concept ideation and choosing the medium for delivery to the colour palettes or paper choice. It is not an afterthought; rather, it is ingrained in our standard practice. We think about environmental impact early in the design stage; we even apply abstract measures, such as a design’s emotional durability.
This is how we design for humans.
What’s the most effective way to get your message across? Do you truly need a publication or printed item to reach your audience, or can you deliver it digitally?
Multi-purposing is a big bonus. Can one publication or printed item serve multiple purposes?
Size does matter. Does the paper printout need to be that big?
Discuss minimising paper wastage with the printer. What’s the best design format for that?
A lesser number of ink colours also means less resources used
It’s a simple one, but choose recycled materials where possible
Find out whether the publication or printed item can be re-used and recycled
Tell your audience about how the work was produced in an environmentally sensitive way
Does it have a high post-consumer recycled content?
Does it come from sustainably managed plantation timber? Look for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification
Is it free of chlorine-bleached fibres? Look for Process Chlorine Free (PCF), Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) or Elemental Chlorine Free (ECF) certifications
Does it come from a paper mill that has an environmental management system certification? Look for ISO 14001 or EMAS
Is it made in Australia? We like to support local industry to reduce the environmental impact of transportation
Ask the printer if they recycle and separate solid waste – paper off-cuts, cardboard, printing plates, ink containers, cleaning rags, palettes, screens and metals
Does the printer have an environmental management system in place? Look for the environmental certification ISO 14001
What is the VOCs emission rating from the printing process? This includes inks, coatings, cleaning solutions, dampening solutions, glues. The less emissions, the better
Can we skip the hard-copy proofs and stick to digital proofs?
Try to use vegetable inks on uncoated paper
Can we avoid metallic and fluorescent inks? These contain heavy metals
Choose aqueous varnish over UV coatings and plastic laminates

The International Women’s Development Agency started in 1985 with a mission – to achieve gender equality for all women. Since then, they’ve worked across the globe supporting women and empowering them to lead. IWDA’s outreach is powerful, meaningful and life-changing. Our Creative Director, Anna Carlile, captured the real-life stories behind that outreach through her photography in the field. Anna went to Timor-Leste, where IWDA partners with Alola, a not-for-profit organisation that not only advocates for women’s rights, but nurtures and empowers local women to become leaders. Anna’s portraits of these leaders in the field are intimate, authentic and direct.
