Our assessment and recommendations for management during delivery focussed on outcomes of engagement with 1000’s of Canberrans, as well as connecting the Project to the ACT Wellbeing Framework; an established community-led indicator framework which guides decision making in the ACT.
Refresh Vaucluse Diamond Bay Review of Environmental Factors
bd infrastructure led community engagement for public display of the project Review of Environmental Factors to divert ocean outfalls to a Bondi treatment plant. The brief was to engage community members about the project and potential construction impacts, drive awareness of the project benefits and maintain a groundswell of support.
The pandemic required all engagement to transfer to digital delivery. We held a co-design workshop with Council and the project team and transferred values and aspirations to a visual brand and campaign motif for the engagement program, which involved virtual information sessions, post-card drops and an innovative ‘shareable App’ instead of door knocking, and an online submissions process.

Ausgrid Regulatory Reset Engagement Framework and Energy Resilience Deliberative Workshops
Ausgrid is the largest electricity distributor on Australia’s east coast, providing power to 1.8 million customers. Every five years Ausgrid is required to submit a draft pricing proposal to the Australian Energy Regulator about its proposed business operations and service delivery. bd infrastructure led a series of workshops to design a customer advocacy model for the reset process. This resulted in the establishment of a Reset Customer Panel that will oversee the process and provide ‘depth’ of customer consideration. We then co-designed a broad and comprehensive engagement framework and developed a graphic design to communicate it, visually signposting key customer groups and phases of the engagement. bd infrastructure is currently undertaking engagement through a series of targeted customer discussions and round tables, and a comprehensive deliberative process.
EnergyConnect is an energy interconnector between South Australia and New South Wales, with an added connection to Victoria. The route passes through renewable energy zones in all three states, enabling future renewable projects in these areas to connect to the grid and supply energy into the network. bd infrastructure provided environmental and planning support to the SecureEnergy Joint Venture. The contractor is delivering the NSW-Western and NSW-Eastern portions of the project, consisting of 700km of new and upgraded transmission lines. As part of the pre-construction approvals process, bd infrastructure prepared construction environmental management plans and pre-construction approval documents, managed technical specialists and provided advice to the design and construction teams.
bd infrastructure provided strategic and practical support to the Central Station precinct renewal team at Transport for NSW. bd infrastructure was commissioned to help prepare for the exhibition of the Central Station Precinct Strategic Vision, the first phase of a new State Significant Precinct assessment process. The team led the preparation of a vision summary, drafting copy, negotiating approvals, developed engagement collateral and illustrative maps and led logistics to support community drop-in sessions, supported media coverage and provided creative services to support the Central Station Precinct Strategic Business Case.
Building on our insights, we developed a strategic engagement approaches document for TfNSW to assist with the next stage of the planning process – the development of the Central Precinct Planning Study. The approaches focussed on opportunities to partner with community and stakeholders and build long term social value and benefits.
Redfern North Eveleigh Strategic Vision community workshop design and facilitation
Transport for NSW engaged bd infrastructure to design and facilitate three community workshops during the development of the Redfern North Eveleigh Strategic Vision. Using digital collaborative tools, our innovative approach facilitated a high level of collaborative involvement and project visioning, overcoming the challenges involved with working remotely in a Covid-safe environment. The insights gained supported planning advice that bd infrastructure also provided to the Redfern North Eveleigh team through a separate commission.
The Parramatta North Program involves a number of strategic projects and initiatives that will help realise the Government’s vision for a globally-significant innovation district at Westmead. bd infrastructure supported Infrastructure NSW and the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment to develop a comprehensive stakeholder map and plan for the precinct. Our work included participation at a cross-agency stakeholder mapping workshop, development of a stakeholder engagement plan to navigate immediate issues and medium-term outcomes and objectives while also persuasively articulating a long-term vision for the precinct.

reconciliation action plan | bd infrastructure
in 2022 we started our journey
bd infrastructure recognises the gap between First Nations people and others in the community and want to use our influence to drive positive change to address this long held injustice.
Communities are at the heart of what we do; we work on projects that influence the ways in which people live and our goal is to make a positive difference to the quality of life of communities as well as to the preservation of the natural environment. We interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and Country through our projects, so it is critical that we remain engaged and educated so that we can work in ways that are respectful and beneficial to all parties.
Our reconciliation journey started with a conversation about including an Acknowledgment of Country in our
email signatures and it quickly became evident that there was much more that we as a business could and should do in regard to understanding previous and current challenges faced by First Nations people and what our role could be in supporting reconciliation.
Our vision for reconciliation is one that fosters a workplace culture that continually values and upholds equity and acceptance of First Nations communities. It is one that sees our business positively influencing the projects we work on, and it is one that continually looks for ways to improve and better listen to our First Nations communities.
bd infrastructure is developing a Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan to educate and facilitate decision making at a whole of business and employee level so that we can play an active, effective and respectful role in our nation’s journey to achieving reconciliation.
