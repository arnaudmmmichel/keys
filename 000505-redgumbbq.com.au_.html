How do I account for our kids or guests with special needs? 
All children over 1 year old should be counted in your booking party number. Please let us know if you will require a high chair. If you can let us know about other kids or individuals with special needs in your group, add it to the notes. It will help us find the best spot for you and your group.

During busy periods, all tables have seating limits of 1 hour 30 minutes for parties of up to 4; 1 hour 45 minutes for parties of 5-6, and 2 hours for parties of 7+. If you would like more time, let us know when you arrive and weâll do our best.
Parties of 10+ will be required to dine from our Happy as a Pig feasting menu 
Why am I being seated next to people I donât know? 
Traditional BBQ is served on big, share tables amongst friends and family. Smaller groups are often seated together across one of our large, wooden tables. You also may be seated on a table by yourself and if you have a preference either way, please let us know in your booking notes – weâll do our best to accommodate.
Can we sit near the kids area? 
When booking, be on the lookout for âFamily Diningâ. This booking will put your group right next to our kidâs Mini Red Gum BBQ play area. They are really popular spots so if youâre unable to find a booking in this area, let us know your preference in your reservation notes and weâll do our best to accommodate. 
We love dogs! But not in the restaurant, unfortunately. We are unable to accommodate your furry friends in either our inside or outdoor dining spaces.
Our outdoor area is weather dependent and cannot be pre-booked. Please make a note on your booking if you would prefer an outdoor table and we will do our best to accommodate.Â 
What can I expect to spend? 
Our per person spend is around $50 – this is for our guests who get a selection of all the stuff. If you are working on a budget, let your server know and theyâll help tailor your menu. Please note – there are weekend surcharges of 10% that apply to all bookings and a 15% Public Holiday surcharge.Â 
What is the difference between Standard & High Top seating? 
High Top Seating refers to backless, bar stool seating and is generally not suitable for elderly people, small children or groups requiring highchairs. Standard Dining is our regular bench or chair style seating.  .Â

BBQ Road Trip FAQs - Red Gum BBQ
** SCROLL DOWN FOR DELIVERY POSTCODES **
When and How will my BBQ Subscription Box be delivered?
Your BBQ Subscription box will be delivered door to door by our HACCP trained,Â  refrigerated courier service partners.Â 
BBQ Subscription Boxes are sent out mid-month, every month – we’ll send you an email reminder the week before, to get excited. Your delivery windows will be sent to you via SMS on the day prior to delivery, advising a 2 hour delivery window estimate.
Melbourne Metro, Geelong, Yarra Valley, Bendigo, Ballarat – 
*Delivery days are subject to change.Â Â 
Your BBQ Box goodies will be nestled in an insulated cool bag and under an ice pack. They will be nice and safe until you are able to get home and pop in the fridge the same day.
Orders placed after the 10th of each month will receive their first delivery the following month.Â 
Melbourne Metro delivery – Free Shipping
Regional Victoria –Â  3 month subscription: $15 shipping.
Regional Victoria – 6-12 month subscription: $30 shipping.
It doesnât seem youâre delivering to my postcode (scroll down for postcode list) – how can I get BBQ?
We attempt to deliver BBQ goodies throughout Victoria, far and wide with the assistance of our logistics partner. Unfortunately, there are some areas that we just canât get to at this time. But reach out to 
 and let us know that youâre interested – we are always expanding and looking at ways to reach more BBQ lovers!Â 
Iâm moving, can I take my subscription with me?Â 
If your moving address is within one of the many post codes we currently deliver to then yes! With our regular notice required for orders (by the 10th of the previous month), we can redirect your order to your new address. We do not offer refunds for subscription boxes but are happy to redirect to another recipient. Contact us at 
My order isnât as expected – itâs wrong, missing items or is just not as expected. What can I do?
Devastating! While we spend so much time, care and love ensuring that your packages are absolutely perfect and something we are really proud of, sometimes mistakes happen or you just donât love what we do. First things first – please get in touch within 5 days via this email: 
 and include images and details of your concern. We will seek to remedy these asap through replacements or refunds.Â 
We do not offer âchange of mindâ refunds for 3 month subscriptions but will refund the remainder of a 6 month or annual subscription less a cancellation fee of $150. In your message with this request, please do let us know how we did not meet expectations – we always strive to improve!Â 
What packaging does my delivery come in?
Items come in an insulated recyclable box with ice-packs to keep them fresh, delivered to your door via refrigerated van.Â 
Like you, we are always frustrated by the amount of packaging used in stuff that comes to our house. Particularly food boxes! So weâve spent a lot of time and energy ridding our boxes of single use plastic and shifting to zero waste. Weâll include details of how to recycle, re-use and compost this packaging.
How do I care for my BBQ?
Rest easy friend – all will be explained. When you receive your box you should open and refrigerate immediately. In general, you should plan to eat your goodies within 3-5 days of delivery but each box will include specific reheat, care and serving instructions and suggestions.Â 
Iâd like to send a BBQ Subscription Box to more than one person
Great idea! Share the BBQ love. If you are ordering more than one Subscription Box, they will need to be ordered as separate transactions. Should you want to add additional items of BBQ merchandise (caps, Tâs, BBQ Sauce and Rubs etc), these will all arrive together with the first BBQ Subscription Box delivery.Â Â
