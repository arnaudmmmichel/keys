About Futureproofed: showing cities and businesses the way to a low-carbon future
We help cities and companies lead the way towards a low-carbon future
Cities and companies need to spearhead the journey towards a low-carbon future. Only actions bring us closer to that future. At Futureproofed, we make it easier and more rewarding for you to take climate action, decrease your carbon footprint and change the world.
Our founder Serge de Gheldere has been on a mission to change the world for decades. In 1999, he established an ecodesign focused engineering company. In 2006 he became one of 
Al Goreâs two first European 'Climate Ambassadors'
Climate expert Steven Van Praet, who studied with Serge, soon joined him in his mission. Since then, they have gathered an enthusiastic team of engineers and domain experts.
In 2016, we initiated the third phase of Futureproofed: evolving from a consultancy to a SaaS + services company. We developed the Futureproofed SaaS platforms, which we combine with our expert advice to help cities and businesses reduce greenhouse gases and build climate plans to transition to a low-carbon world. Â Willem Delbaere, successful serial SaaS entrepreneur and co-founder of Teamleader (sold to Visma), and Officient (sold to Exact)Â  joined as CTO to lay the foundation of the Futureproofed SaaS platforms.
Everyone single team member at Futureproofed is here to help reduce our collective impact on climate change and help build an attractive, sustainable future.
Futureproofed is a team of 25+ enthusiasts with a mix of idealism, expertise and business thinking. Weâre all passionate about being part of the solution. So, weâre constantly refining our software platform and deepening our know-how to help you lead the way towards a low-carbon future. From understanding your carbon footprint, to managing it and taking action. Weâre always available. Weâre in it together.
