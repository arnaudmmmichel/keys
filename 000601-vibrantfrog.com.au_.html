Vibrant Frog | Culture Shaping + Leadership Consulting
The world is turbulent, fast-paced and complex - right? And all the evidence is that it’s only getting faster. Bigger. More. So, the ability for organisations and people to respond quickly and well to an increasingly dynamic environment is paramount.
And yet, at the same time, it seems to be getting harder and harder to get anything done with the kind of agility and speed that you crave, that customers and boards demand and that technology ought to provide.
Welcome to the Frog.  We are Culture Shapers and Leadership Consultants.
We help you do hard things so you can thrive in this stormy world. We work next to your leaders to shape culture with intention and get the results you’re after.  The good news is that most of the energy, purpose and skill needed are already there. We will help you remove the non-value adding work in everyone’s world (hint: it’s more than you think) and use the recovered time to ignite your people’s passion and direct their purpose.
Then, we’ll help you get out of their way.
We’re the people you call for the tricky situation, to work with the challenging team, to be the boost you know you need but are unsure how to deliver. All in service of better, more sustained results, and with no fuss.
Fortunately, ambiguity is where we thrive, connecting humans with systems, strategy with detail, reflection with speed. Getting forensic and drawing on instinct and experience (yours and ours), together we identify the right levers to crank for the critical outcomes. Through size, expertise, mindset and approach, Vibrant Frog epitomises genuine ‘agility’ in its most considered form.
Creativity, imagination, and willingness to take calculated risks will be key differentiators now and into the future.
The Frogs encourage the pursuit of simplicity and effectiveness. We use and teach systems thinking, so your people can adjust the ecosystem to deliver on your strategy by understanding why and how things happen. We consider every situation unique, so creativity is our natural and necessary response. The element of fun we bring to your biggest hitches is intentional, ensuring optimal brain function and relationship in problem solving.
The Frogs bring bucket loads of heart. We are real. We encourage real.
We have genuine compassion for the people we work with and the challenges they face. We connect people, for their own health and for organisational vitality. Concurrently, we hold people to account through the climate we create.  People enjoy the ride.
We’re pretty attached to some foundational models for removing complexity, unleashing courage and capability, and aligning the ‘stuff’ of organisations to get the best results. But we know their limitations.
Strong relationships with our clients are foundational to any work we do, so that what’s possible and practical becomes the focus.
This looks like balancing new ideas with your tried and true, and implementing clear and simple steps to generate significant cultural and business SHIFT. Our culture shaping and leadership consulting is always tied to your work results – the projects that need better traction, the process that’s been in the too hard basket for too long.

From a brief investigation that brings clarity, to a longer term culture-shaping engagement, we don’t mind where we start. But we do mind how we work. Big or small our focus is always on SHIFT

Soft skills … screaming out for a brand refresh
Much business conversation focuses on being outcomes driven, delivering value, thinking strategically, taking responsibility, accountability, ownership, … getting results.  And rightly so. Typically, the way leaders pursue these things is by telling their people to do them, be them, achieve them.  This might look like stating the vision or goal, restating it now and again,…

Culture?!  The water in your fish tank is murky but you’re doin’ your best.  Or, it’s ok but could definitely be cleaner
You’re spending too much time doing stuff that other people should be doing or that shouldn’t be done at all
You know you have similar skill gaps across layers in the organisation – it’s a real block
You feel like there’s an issue but the things you’ve tried so far don’t seem to be working well enough
You’ve got great people who could be even better given half a chance… you’ve also got some key people needing some love  
There are leaders in your world who could do with 1:1 attention, tools that are right for them right now, and help using those tools 
The team is new, feels clunky or isn’t playing nicely with others – there’s definitely room to grow

Why the Frogs for winc? (a client’s story)
I’ve worked with the Frogs for more than 10 years of my career now.  It has been a joyful and satisfying ride. It started at Staples (now winc), where it was a collective belief that the quality of our leaders was key to our commercial success (made my job easier!).  So, as National Organisational Development…
Your coach is not your friend
Well, they might be, but that’s not their job. So, what is their job? (Excellent question.) At a macro level, there’s probably a spectrum from ‘questions only’ at one end to ‘a bit of everything’ at the other. ‘Questions only’ does what it says on the tin.  But what, in practice, does ‘a bit of…
(But is that the most useful question?) I’ve never found it easy to describe nor to translate.  I really don’t know why.  And yet, you’ve gotta be clear on what you do so you can sell it, right?  Perhaps, more specifically, I find it difficult to describe the power and value gained from it.  I’ve…
The Frogs play in the leadership + culture space.  This hasn’t traditionally prompted conversations about sustainability policy + practices with clients – as businesses or as individuals.  In fact, we used to tiptoe around it – each to their own, right?  We’d focus on how to boost their leadership or shift their culture.  Yet it…
Every crisis brings opportunity, forcing us to act radically, at least in the short term.  COVID-19 has seen countries around the world shut down their borders and economies to defend against the pandemic.  Governments are delivering huge temporary monetary injections to help people and organisations stay afloat.

Need I even set the scene?  Everyone’s in it.  We can’t go 5 minutes without talking about it.  Everyone’s feeling it, to some degree.  COVID-19 is working its way across and around the world.  While it was predicted (check out Bill Gates TED talk, 2015), we weren’t ready.  Arguably we’re still not ready.

At 46, I was lucky (some said ‘stupid’) enough to try on women’s AFL.  A friend convinced me to just ‘give it a go’.  I rocked up to the first training session.  I felt I should at least go to the second.  I had a strong urge to give the third a go.  I really wanted…

Machines more like people.  People more like machines.  Huh?!
In the push for AI, machine learning, and all that progressive jazz, business still needs and will continue to need, people.  Flesh + bone, thinking + feeling.  People.  For the stuff that AI wont be doing – the collaboration, connection, relationship, energy, creativity that comes from engaged human hearts and minds.  After all, organisations are…

Winding down more than 90% of its APAC operations (including making 3,600 people redundant), the task of keeping staff engaged to manage risk exposure and meeting client, regulator and parent company deliverables was a unique and complex project.
After years of autocratic leadership, staff cuts, cost reduction initiatives and reorganisations – all with the associated cultural toll – a new Exec team wanted to upgrade their own working methods, revitalise culture and equip the next level of senior leaders to handle increased autonomy.
The business was experiencing rapid evolution in many directions at the same time. To thrive in this turbulence and succeed in their ever-expanding roles, required senior leaders to develop a leadership culture that supported high performance in a rapidly changing environment and maintained their results trajectory.
The business was experiencing a combination of pressures: aggressive growth targets, switching from product focus to consulting, tensions between sales and delivery, and sprinting for a place in the IoT, mobility + security landscape.  A significant yet optimistically-led shift was needed that improved business results and lifted employee engagement.

Soft skills ... screaming out for a brand refresh - Vibrant Frog
Soft skills … screaming out for a brand refresh
Much business conversation focuses on being outcomes driven, delivering value, thinking strategically, taking responsibility, accountability, ownership, … getting results.  And rightly so.
Typically, the way leaders pursue these things is by telling their people to do them, be them, achieve them.  This might look like stating the vision or goal, restating it now and again, reiterating the results they need (sometimes louder than last time), telling their people to “think more strategically” or behave like ‘business leaders’.  Encouraging them to finish things, get the report in, revisit those numbers, … get their teams onto it.  When this doesn’t work, they get annoyed and step in and fix it.  
  Because in the moment (under pressure, when they don’t have very much time and reporting deadlines are looming) it feels like it’s the best option.  It often feels like it’s the only option.
At the same time, there’s a wealth of research, training, and discussion around how people and teams often don’t perform to their potential.  Leaders ‘know’ (intellectually, at least) that they all need alignment on direction, stronger collaboration skills, increased team cohesion, better engagement, higher motivation … all that stuff that improves performance.  All the while keeping an eye on everyone’s mental health.  Focusing.  Juggling.
And then there’s this: when people become leaders, there’s this underlying assumption (a false and dangerous one) that miraculously they’ve gained both the understanding and skill to lift their people’s performance and unleash their potential.  After all, they’re leaders now – that’s their job.
The skills that these leaders desperately need to do their job – to help people perform at their best – are some of the hardest skills to master.  Hard core leaders (the leaders most interested in the success of the business, who understand their role in that) have them in bucket loads.  Yet, they’re often called ‘soft skills’.  Sometimes the ‘warm and fluffy’ stuff (typically by those who don’t have them).
‘Soft’?  I see marshmallows and fluffy slippers.  I hear a nurturing tone.  It’s a mother’s hug.  The stuff for girls.
And as soon as the word ‘soft’ or ‘warm’ or ‘fluffy’ comes out of someone’s mouth in relation to capability, eyes glaze over and minds move on to more important things (the work – “let’s talk about the work”).  Who wants to spend time getting better at soft skills?  Not me.  So senior managers, often struggling to motivate their people and encountering all kinds of people problems that have them stumped, jump into another meeting about work.  ‘Soft’ means many brush leadership skills off as unnecessary extras.
Perhaps this reticence is because soft skills aren’t so much about 
 you can do (although the doing part is firmly in the mix).  They are more about 
how you choose to show up
.  They require courage, vulnerability, authenticity, resilience, humour, heart, and critically, a desire to be better.  While not easy to master, they have a huge impact (just ask anyone reporting to anyone else).

 knows, including the PM’s leader.  Everyone talks about it ad nauseam.
Then they work around that person.  Other problems (unexpected ones) arise.
What’s needed is a direct conversation (and frankly, this is the most compassionate and valuable option for the PM 
 the business).  The PM’s leader needs to take the lead (“what’s going on?” would be a good start… ) and (probably) put a performance plan in place.  But that depends on what comes out of the conversation.
 miraculously gain the skill to lead others when promoted means they won’t have this conversation on the top of their ‘to do’ list.
Have the potentially tricky performance conversation?  Not so much.  (Soon … just not right now.)
It will definitely be on their mind, depleting their battery, and causing angst.  And the impact of their PM on others and on results will certainly be getting uglier.
Then a restructure.  A new manager.
Some time to assess (“we have to be fair and give them a real go”).
Realisation of what is needed (a performance plan).
Oh, other ‘more urgent’ matters to deal with.
Yep, the conversation needs to happen, but not right now.
And maybe ‘not on my watch’.
Since we apparently prefer (read: feel more comfortable with) the ‘hard’ stuff, let’s talk costs.  What’s the cost of 
Caused by the bottleneck of ‘missed work’.
And what about the stuff that’s harder to measure?

Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts
– William Bruce Cameron (American sociologist).
Call them hard, call them soft – measures, skills.  Whatever you want to call them, they’re all connected.  Organisations are systems, ranging from small to massive – everything impacts everything else.  And the soft skills are more instrumental in getting you your hard results.
What do these critical leadership skills need to be called for your business and its people to make them a priority?

 – seems globally pertinent just now. Our time has come.
It’s a big call. Trickier when the people in organisations we work with are unable to pay attention. Pre-COVID, they were bombarded – hourly, daily – by the ‘urgent’. Now, many have plunged into a world of increased complexity (and it was hardly ‘simple’ before), uncertainty + isolation. They’re trying to maintain performance, while juggling short term household logistics (including staying sane, keeping fit, and supporting those around them). No wonder ’emotional whiplash’ is common. That’s a lot to ask, of all of us.

We invite reflection, sharing, practise and experimentation with new skills, so you can work out better ways to show up. In each of the many roles you play. You define and achieve things that are important to you. Your entire ecosystem benefits. And you can breathe.
I just feel more on top of things
” – from a recent Action on Purpose (AOP) member.
Vibrant Frog works mostly at the macro level across businesses, to help them shift culture and implement strategy. But we love to work with people one-on-one, in more intimate groups. Now seems the time for connecting smaller groups, injecting energy and helping people shift to sometimes very different ways of working, alone and collectively.
AOP gives us the gift of stronger and deeper connection. For clients, they often say “It was life-changing” (yep, they do!). Sometimes we get immediate feedback on how things have improved. Sometimes it’s a year or two afterwards, an email or LinkedIn message out of the blue, explaining where they are now and how AOP helped.
That’s soul food for all of us
For some, Action on Purpose is a nuanced look at life, and a re-commitment to things they’ve overlooked.
For others, it is an opportunity to focus clearly on what needs to happen right now, but in a way that retains balance with the wider world and the longer game.
The great thing is that, whatever your starting point, AOP gives an opportunity to draw a line in the sand, to take stock, and 
AOP has proven invaluable for organisations and can be used programmatically to help leaders transition, to make talent shine brighter or to help people recommit to the business.
Leadership should be like a lighthouse: unwavering, assuring, constant and most of all, a bearer of light to show the way, come rain or shine. – Dr Moses Simuyemba
Here’s what it looks and feels like:
Individual coaching (personalised attention) – at the start, the end, and wherever else is required
10 x weekly 2.5 hour virtual + interactive workshops with a small brains trust: to think, connect, challenge, learn, experiment
Personal audit, including understanding what really drives you, and how to harness your motivation – a critical way to ground yourself as change speeds up
Relentless practise in getting meaningful stuff done – the stuff that counts
A spruce-up of your self-image, because the decisions we make come through the lens of our self-perception. You need one that supports where you’re heading!
Action on Purpose is our intentional approach to supporting people through the current (and likely future) uncertainty.  It’s invaluable at the best of times. It’s critical now. A Facebook post and access to online mindfulness meditations may provide some respite for some people, if they actively participate more than a couple of times. The discipline required to start a new practice is challenging… just knowing that you 
 doesn’t get it done.  Action on Purpose gives you a helping hand: the tools, techniques and ways of thinking to swim strongly and master the waves rather than get pulled under. With a coach and a brains trust by your side.
Because ‘being your best’ isn’t an intellectual exercise. You don’t just watch a TED talk, listen to a podcast, read a book, have a bit of a think and ‘Eureka’! If nothing changes, nothing changes.
It is called ‘Action on Purpose’ because you have to 
It is like having a personal trainer for the mind, building the muscle to follow through on the things you’ve decided are important and valuable.

So join our multi-business virtual Action on Purpose.  If getting the right stuff done and feeling more in control sparks joy for you, give us a call and talk to us about what you are after:
It’s a quick and easy way to decide if there is a fit.
Expect to shift. Expect to challenge your thinking. Expect new friendships. Expect more. We will expect it of you, too. We will support you gently and firmly while you explore what’s possible.
