A new era of business education, training, coaching, and mentoring programs to help time and resource-poor Startups & SMEs reach their goals faster. 
As if they had an extra hour in the day and day in the week. 
Growing your business while managing day-to-day operations can be challenging.  It may feel you never have the time to work on your business as you’re too busy working in your business. You know you need to do something to help you get to the next level, however, you don’t know what you don’t know or may not know where to start.  Don’t give the power away to a consultant or agency, build your own internal capability edge by letting us help you build your strategic agility to grow your business. 
Elevate your community's economic development with our expert guidance. We'll help you harness innovation, entrepreneurship, and digital transformation to drive decent work, growth, and job creation. Together, we'll build the confidence and capabilities of your business community, creating opportunities for success today and in the future. We create custom programs, highly personalised to your community and have high standards of measurement to ensure they’re transformational.
Whether you’re an early-stage startup seeking to engage investors, partnerships or attracting early adopters or a scaling startup that is actively raising funds, strategic partnerships or trying to increase your customer acquisition, you need to articulate the value of what you do to several audiences succinctly so that they want to take action. With limited resources, every action counts and whilst it may be easier to do it yourself, it isn’t always the quickest or most impactful. Let us help you get there faster.
We are a B Corp certified passionate team of people who provide business education, training, coaching and mentoring, but not as you know it. We’re different in a lot of ways, but we think these three things stand us apart from anything else out there:
 to the specific needs and goals of a business or business community; not a one-size-fits-all approach. We focus on providing the knowledge and skills you need to level up and achieve your goals, with an emphasis on learning and implementing actions that will help you meet impactful outcomes.
Our teaching and learning methodology, whilst evidence and best practice-based and developed by people with academic backgrounds in teaching and education, is different. It’s developed specifically for Startups & SMEs, who are time-poor. It’s hyper-personalised , 
micro, it fits in with busy schedules
, it’s fun and makes frameworks and concepts easy to understand and implement. We’re pioneering a new age in education and training. This is unlike anything you have done before. 
, helping you to apply your knowledge to get the results you need faster. Our experienced mentors help you to come up with those gold nugget ideas and overcome any obstacles. This could be choosing and implementing a CRM system, a workflow, a marketing campaign or an innovation program. We coach you to build your internal capability edge by empowering you and your team to build your skills and confidence and not have to rely on external agencies.
Imagine a world where there is decent work and economic development for all. Local communities are thriving because challenges are being solved through business and business is providing opportunities for the community. We’re big believers that business can be a force for good so we’re going to work hard to help your business thrive.
Small to medium sized businesses are the backbone of global economies and yet they often face the greatest hardships in changing markets. Research often indicates the failure of an SME is down to the lack of direction & planning, lack of market research or sales & marketing, lack of strategy or inability to execute, lack of knowledge and skills, or an inability to adapt to market changes in time. In our experience, in most cases, it isn’t due to the lack of competence of the business owner or leadership team, but the lack of time to invest in the above.
If only they had an extra hour in the day or an extra day in the week (25hours and 8 days, if you will). 
That’s where we come in, we’re here to help Startups & SMEs adopt practices that will not only ensure their survival but will see themselves, their business and their community thrive.

Entrepreneurs, innovators, teachers, learning designers, creatives, digital specialists, futurists, analysts and mentors
From the same team that founded Marketing Entourage in 2015, 25eight evolved to meet the need of high-quality, fair cost up to the minute business education, mentoring and implementation support for time-poor Startups & SMEs. Challenged with growing their business but wanting to help the startups, small businesses and SMEs that had little time and/or budget but needed expert advice and support to grow their business, they knew they needed to create a solution.
The founders, Sam and Phil, are passionate about making an impact and believe business can be a force for good. They knew they could make a difference to smaller businesses if they gave them the right tools and helped change their mindset. Recognising that a lot of education and support for businesses was transactional or transient they have used their academic understanding and extensive industry experience to create transformational outcomes for the people they serve.
We believe that we can deliver the most impactful business training for Startups & small to medium-sized businesses. And we constantly measure this. Our North Star Metric is an increase in capability and confidence, which we know also leads to more traditional measurements of success.
The entrepreneurship and business are valid careers, often providing opportunities for decent work and the opportunity to continuously develop your knowledge and skills., however, quality and accessible education to help more people enter this career is lacking. 
Entrepreneurs have solved some of the most pressing societal and environmental issues and in the process driven innovation for their local communities and enabled economic benefits. But equally credit should be given for local SMEs that provide jobs and opportunities for their communities. 
There should be equity in access to resources to support all businesses, especially those in remote or regional areas, and where barriers to participating in entrepreneurship are felt.  We design our programs to address this and also hope to lessen the digital divide. 
Business leaders don’t need to spend months and thousands of dollars to get an MBA to be credible. However, they do need to invest in building the right strategy to get the maximum results from their effrots. No point learning how to do something, if they don’t know why they should and how it will help achieve their vision.
There should be less focus on the one-off, transactional relationships with agencies, RTOs, and ‘educators’ only focused on telling them the same thing as they tell everyone else. Education should be transformational, it should transform what you do.  That’s why we focus on building strategic agility in every program we deliver.
With several digital transformations under her belt in her 20+ years of industry experience, Sam likes to sit at the intersection of business, creativity and technology. Her Master of Teaching is the icing on the cake as she drives high standards and best practice to ensure what is learned is adopted and impactful.
Like many of the team, Kim has had interesting and diverse roles within the startup and business community and her ability to fit the pieces of the puzzle together coherently and create order from chaos is what makes her the powerhouse of the business. Kim’s natural ability to translate concepts into actions and nurture others to achieve helps set us apart.
If 10,000 hours is the benchmark for excellence, Phil reigns supreme as a mentor. His extensive experience leading brands is married with his ability to identify opportunities for smaller business to give them the ‘gold nuggets’ they need to get traction. His ‘serendipity hacking’ is the magic sauce in the business.
When Georgina left one of her previous roles it took three people to replace her. She is an executor and in the nicest possible way, no checklist or to do list is safe in her presence. Her humble ability to create highly effective systems and processes is only matched by her magnificent ability ensure our team and our company remains ultimately human.
Driving innovation is at the heart of this continuous learner who is adept at making change accessible and comfortable. Emma’s background in scaling tech start-ups, business marketing and digital transformations is complemented by her experience in Edtech passion for adoption and the people side.
What do you get if you cross academic excellence in educational practices with technical nous and creativity? It’s a rare find and we’re very lucky to have Anna. To top it off, her passion and enthusiasm for creating exceedingly impactful and amazing customer and learning experiences help us delight and engage whilst building confidence and capability.
25eight forms a strategic alliance with Industry Capability Network (ICN) to help build the capabilities of Australian businesses to win more contracts, expand into new markets, and build the profile and perception of their business. 
Being a B Corp saved our business
Having a purpose and being driven to make impact helped 25eight forge through a tumultuous time for many SMEs. Not only that, but this super focus has helped drive growth and scale ambitions that wouldn’t have been possible before .

Our vision is decent work and economic development for all
We want time-poor businesses to have the confidence and capability to thrive in competitive and evolving markets. Such that it positively impacts the society around them. 
We want them to stand tall against larger enterprises. 
By 2030 we will ensure a minimum of 20 million business leaders overcome the challenge of time and money to grow their businesses. 
Our mission is to reduce the number of fallen small to medium-sized businesses and empower business leaders with the smarts,  tools and support to survive and thrive. 
Why do we do what we do?
Small to medium-sized businesses (SMEs) are the backbone of local communities; providing opportunities for meaningful work, fostering local economies and account for 60-70% of jobs in most OECD countries. SME’s account for 99.8% of Australian businesses and contribute significantly to Australia’s economy. 
However, small to medium-sized businesses have a much lower success rate than larger business and face greater hardships in extreme market conditions. SME’s are less likely to have digital strategies or have adopted digital transformations due to a lack of time, resources, confidence and/or knowledge to do so. 
By building their confidence and capabilities to develop effective strategies and use cutting edge practices , they can increase revenue, time, job creation and the longevity of their business whilst developing future of work skills that will help them now and into the future. This not only benefits them personally but contributes to the community around them. 
We believe that business education, training and support should be accessible and transformational. It should help change mindsets and lead to adoption (the implementation of the learning) continuously. In order to do this, we must first deeply understand the needs of the individual and business as well as best practice in adult learning and the latest innovative practices. We measure this with an assessment, data and a dedication to research.
Average engagement and completion rates of free and paid courses and business support programs are typically quite low. Participants have to be highly intrinsically motivated to complete them. We set ourselves high targets in engagement and completion rates so that we provide a support environment that encourages all participants to complete a stage in their learning journey. We measure this throughout our engagement.
Our unique assessment allows us to pinpoint the sweet spot of learning for our participants, allowing them to develop self-efficacy to action what they have learned. We measure that confidence and continue to measure the impact of the learnt frameworks and tools on them and their business. We believe that continuous confidence in action leads to greater business maturity and a willingness to innovate.
The real measurement of our success is if our programs have created decent work and economic development.  We measure further to the completion of our engagements to understand the impact on revenue, time and efficiencies, job creation, profitability and confidence in their abilities and resilience to market change. We know our programs are truly transformational when tangible changes are recorded.
If small to medium-sized businesses succeed, the community succeeds
SME’s contribute to local economies by bringing growth and innovation to the community in which they are established. They also provide employment opportunities for many people, including those that may experience disadvantage, to achieve financial success and independence. 
We love talking about the change we want to see!

What we do to help you grow your business
You are serious about growth but have never had the chance to properly review your business to identify opportunities to improve or innovate because you spend so much time working in the business. You just need to know where to start. Our diagnistic can help. A low cost, low time commitment service that pinpoints exactly what you can do to grow your business. You can decide what to do from there.
You may need help in a specific area (e.g., strategy, digital, new product development or creative) and do not want to hire; haven’t had a great experience with agencies and lack the time to do it yourself. You may just need something set up so you can get on with growing the business. We’ll combine capability building training and our in-house support services to get you there faster.
You want to increase your capability but want to make sure you get the most from your investment in time and money. You have taken some education and training before, but had various degrees of success. Our programs are aimed at helping you adopt what you learn for maximum return on investment. They are designed to fit into your busy schedules and can be done in as little as one hour a week. Designed by SMEs for SMEs.

Core areas in education, mentoring & support
Rowing harder doesn’t help if you’re going in the wrong direction.  This is one of the most important areas to get right and one where new practices and tools can help you navigate the changing markets around you. We are influenced by strategic foresign, design thinking, human centred design, blue ocean strategy and lean startups to help you become an innovative leader of the future 
If you don’t have customers, you don’t have a business. As the role of sales and marketing has changed over the years and the prominence and importance of the customer experience grown, our education and mentoring ensures you connect with your customers with the best message on the right channel at the optimal time.
If you’re not online, does your business even exist? That’s the current sentiment of consumers. technology can be a powerful enabler in your business but, regardless of your confidence with digital, it is often overwhelming to navigate the right choices for you, your business and your customers. Our training helps you digital transform for better customer experiences and greater efficiency.
Innovation is vital for Australia’s future and SMEs face significant challenges in accessing services and the support they need to adapt (especially when so much is changing around them and doing so at speed).  Imagine feeling like Tesla with your own innovation department focused on identifying how you can improve your business based on your customers need. We can help you do that.
Standard Ledger is an accounting firm embracing virtual and doing things differently, serving startups and high-growth SMEs. They had huge ambitions to expand their markets domestically and internationally. They needed a growth strategy and guidance to implement it. Over time, as their team grew, they needed support to ensure their systems and processes and how best to utilise the tech they invested in for each team didn’t compromise on the customer experience and their growth ambitions.
Standard Ledger were one of the founding participants of our Startup Marketing Program, a year-long strategy and capability-building program that included mentoring and accountability. At the end of the year, they had a detailed growth strategy, however, still felt that they lacked the internal skills to fully implement it. Standard Ledger is the reason that the 1:1 service began as we worked with them in 90-day periods to support the implementation of their strategy. The strategy was working and the team and offices growing. so we then started to focus on the systems that supported them so they could effectively scale. We assessed their tech stack and prioritised a strategy that included the tech they invested in alongside training the team to use it efficiently. Over the course of the three years (and counting), we have helped in three key areas:
Developed a clear unique value proposition
Mapped the sales funnel, CTR and conversions to find gaps and inefficiencies to be addressed
Updated the entire sales process - implemented new nurture emails, workflows, feedback forms, checklists, automation and more, and met with the team to execute
Created internal reporting dashboards and work with the team to execute regular reporting cycles
Marketing messaging, landing page design and support for campaigns throughout the year
Revamping high-traffic website pages for a smoother customer experience

Standard Ledger is an accounting firm embracing virtual and doing things differently, serving startups and high-growth SMEs. They had huge ambitions to expand their markets domestically and internationally. They needed a growth strategy and guidance to implement it. Over time, as their team grew, they needed support to ensure their systems and processes and how best to utilise the tech they invested in for each team didn’t compromise on the customer experience and their growth ambitions.
Standard Ledger were one of the founding participants of our Startup Marketing Program, a year-long strategy and capability-building program that included mentoring and accountability. At the end of the year, they had a detailed growth strategy, however, still felt that they lacked the internal skills to fully implement it. Standard Ledger is the reason that the 1:1 service began as we worked with them in 90-day periods to support the implementation of their strategy. The strategy was working and the team and offices growing. so we then started to focus on the systems that supported them so they could effectively scale. We assessed their tech stack and prioritised a strategy that included the tech they invested in alongside training the team to use it efficiently. Over the course of the three years (and counting), we have helped in three key areas:
Developed a clear unique value proposition
Mapped the sales funnel, CTR and conversions to find gaps and inefficiencies to be addressed
Updated the entire sales process - implemented new nurture emails, workflows, feedback forms, checklists, automation and more, and met with the team to execute
Created internal reporting dashboards and work with the team to execute regular reporting cycles
Marketing messaging, landing page design and support for campaigns throughout the year
Revamping high-traffic website pages for a smoother customer experience
Created various supporting documentation on how the system works for each team and trained them in their specialist areas
Cleansed the HubSpot system and made optimisations based on how SL use the tool
Deep tool analysis - List, Form, Workflow and Property review, feedback and updates to logic to improve efficiencies
Ensured the tech stack was in working order - connected integrations, accounts, pixels, analytics and other various tools

Accelerate the success of your Startup
Whilst building your own strategic agility 
Founding a Startups can be exhilarating, but it comes with a few challenges. Operating in an environment of uncertainty, with no guarantee of success is incredibly stressful even for the most passionate of founders. Often, you have limited resources, be that financial or operational, and are competing in established markets.
You need to differentiate yourself and gain market share from established players with greater resources and brand recognition. 
You need to deeply understand your target audience’s needs and how your solution meets them. 
Any action you take needs to be strategic, you don’t have the luxury of time to try and figure it out, you need effective marketing and customer acquisition strategies, you need to win investors and partners over and attract the right talent. 
Education & Mentoring Programs that support you and your success
We have been helping Startups since our days with BlueChilli in 2015. We have rolled out programs supported by LaunchVic and Austrade to accelerate the success and expansion of Australian Startups. 
We’ve developed simple frameworks that get incredible results fast because we know that time is of the essence and resources are limited. 
We wrap these into education programs that don’t take you months to complete and are supported by industry expert mentors that guide you to reaching your goals and connect you to the right people.
Your messaging is the most important aspect of your business. The lesser known you are the better your messaging needs to be. If you can’t convey the value of what you do to anyone, it will be incredibly difficult for you to grow.  Getting your messaging right can make a significant difference to the results of anything you do, whether you’re pitching for investment, acquiring customers, winning over partners or attracting and training talent. 
A winning business pitch that can be tailored to different scenarios and audiences is your secret weapon to Startup success. 25eight’s Pitch Training Program has helped hundreds of Australian founders take their business to the next level.

Goal based hyper-personalised learning experiences for time & resource poor business
Level up what you already know and do
Our ‘trainers’ don’t have a background in HR or organisational behaviour, they are experienced entrepreneurs, subject matter experts and expert mentors. They practice what they preach and they’re on top of their game. Not only will they help you build your strategic capabilities but they’ll offer those gold nugget ideas that will help propel your business
With a bunch of academics on the team, we have high standards for engagement and completion rates. We follow best practice for our teaching and learning to make sure what you learn sticks and is easy to implement. On top of that, it is highly personalised to you and your goals and designed to fit into busy schedules, micro-learning, simplified concepts - whatever we can do to help you build lasting capability quickly
Get help to action what you learn
Sometimes you just need someone to do a bit of the heavy lifting to help you implement what you’ve learnt.  It may be getting your CRM properly set up, creating a design template, sales playbook or innovation program. We have a team of specialists that ensure the power remains with you whilst providing their strategy, digital and creative support services.
We build your capabilities to lead a thriving business
It is relevant to you, to your business situation, to this time in the market, to your literacy levels and your industry segment. This applies to our group programs despite your going through the program with others, it’s still specific to you. It’s extremely personalised for our 1:1 clients.
Doesn’t sound too exciting, does it?! However, we believe that anything can be taught as long as it follows a process.  Innovation and creativity actually thrive on process. We make it really simple to incrementally build on what you have learned through a very structured process
We’re a bunch of nerds that nerd out on strategic foresight, design thinking, work/life hacks, tech hacks, growth hacks. This stuff lights our fire. What makes us even happier is if we can take the essence of high level concepts and make them into easy to follow frameworks so a business of any size can follow it. 
This is one of our values and we live it.  We take our work serious but we take having fun at work even more serious. We’re not going to get you to do anything you feel uncomfortable with but we do make it engaging (it’s one of our measurements) so you want to finish a program with us. 
One of our greatest pleasures is hearing past participants teaching other people what they have learned through one of our programs because that shows that they fully understand and have been able to action what they have learned.  This means that what you take with you is not only tools that will help you now, but tools that help you in the future
Heaps of companies say that they care about you but don’t live it. We’re different, we care so much about you you’ll feel like we work for you. We form close relationships with our clients and have built a lovely community of business leaders with increased confidence in their entrepreneurial capabilities. We’d love for you to be a part of that too.
