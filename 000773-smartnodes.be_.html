Light point - Connected management - LACROIX City
LACROIX City consists of 650 “smart city” professionals in France and Europe helping local authorities to build the smart roads necessary to secure and streamline all types of mobility and to ensure an ecological balance for our towns and territories.
Connected management of the light points through a scalable RF communication network 
transforms the street lighting network into a scalable communication network for other city sensors
 thanks its ecosystems of nodes and gateways, while providing a solution to manage light points.
 through dimming strategies and detection (movement and speed)
 with nodes adapted to NEMA and Zhaga standards
 thanks to the embedded GPS in nodes, their automatic configuration and the interoperability of NEMA and Zhaga nodes
Avoid power grid constraints thanks to the
Transform the Street Light infrastructure into a
 scalable communication network for the Smart City
