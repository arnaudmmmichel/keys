The road to a clean planet.                
                      Our planet is running out of road. The time to move is now. 
                      And we're here to make a real difference, today.
                      MOTION ENERGY is more than a name. 
                      Emotive, because we're excited to be driving real change. 
                      And passionate about cleaning our planet's air.
                      Energetic, because we're optimistic about a cleaner, better future. 
                      And respectful of the vast energy it takes to get there.
                      A future where our air is as clean as our collective conscience. 
                      And where the only transport we use is electric.
                      The change is already in motion. 
                      And we have the energy to accelerate it.
Welcome to Motion Energy. Impact, backed by integrity.
Right now, transport accounts for around 23% of the world’s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, with road transport responsible for 70% of those.
                      Communities all over the planet are suffering. The WHO has identified that around 99% of the world lives in air that’s polluted above acceptable limits. The
                      world desperately needs to move to clean air, while there’s still time.
                      Working alongside world-leading carbon accounting and impact standards, we’ve created a more meaningful platform -- with integrity, and real impact -- that’s
                      solely focused on supporting clean transport uptake.
                      We provide unique dual certification, backed by explicit, measured, impact outcomes resulting from clean transport activities, aligned
9 of the Global Goals for Sustainable Development.
                      We provide valuable carbon finance for electric vehicle activities, supporting decarbonisation for your supply chain, your local area, or global
                      sphere of influence. For your stakeholders, your children, and for generations to come.
