meta description:CSR

HELIOZ is a strategic partner for the European and Indian Companies in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), specialized on high quality project implementation and developing impact in the global south while providing unique content and supporting its partners in communications and marketing. This enables HELIOZ customers to stand out over its competition and increase brand value.
„Corporate Social Responsibility is a management concept whereby  companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and interactions with their stakeholders. CSR is generally understood as being the way through which a company achieves a balance  of economic, environmental and social imperatives, while at the same time addressing the expectations of  shareholders and stakeholders.“
Customers expect companies to act responsibly and tackle social and environmental issues which have put a spotlight on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives of companies around the world. CSR activities are important for internal and external stakeholders such as customers, employees, shareholders, and suppliers. They are documented in annual reports and used for marketing activities. HELIOZ offers made to measure CSR programmes of all scales. Developing and working closely together with our customers we ensure successful CSR initiatives that create true impact around the topics of safe drinking water, education, women empowerment and much more.
Besides Europe, we have identified India as special CSR target market with a huge growth potential due to the legal obligation of large companies to invest 2% of their profits in the common good. From 2015 to 2017 the CSR market volume in India has grown by 134% to approximately € 1,87bn with a specific potential in the area of water/sanitation of € 470m per year. There are some NGOs and private initiatives in the CSR area of the Companies Act, but this market is currently still very fragmented and open to new players in the field of water.
Over the years HELIOZ has been building up reference projects for local governments in East Africa, Bangladesh and India, demonstrating our revolutionary approach and strong impact at a community level.
The Global Water & Climate Crisis
Water is a finite and irreplaceable resource that is fundamental to human survival and well-being. However, in many parts of the world the availability of safe drinking water is still not secured and millions of people lack access to safe, sufficient and affordable water. In 2012, the governments at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development confirmed that safe drinking water is at the core of sustainable development.
Climate Change is one of the biggest challenges of our lifetime and the largest threat to current and future generations. To limit global warming to 1.5°C, global carbon emissions need to decrease to 55% of 2010 levels by the year 2030. To reach this ambitious goal, the United Nations have created the Agenda 2030 and defined 17 Sustainable Develop-ment Goals (SDGs).
Climate Change is a race against time. There are only 10 years left to reach the Global Goals. The clock is ticking, and immediate action is needed to mitigate global warming and protect our planet and its most vulnerable inhabitants.
Low income households in rural areas of the Global South are lacking access to safe drinking water and due to the consumption of contaminated water are facing additional costs for water treatment solutions or health treatment. The main technologies currently available for household water treatment are boiling with firewood, filtration, UV light and chlorination. These products are expensive, require regular maintenance and supplies or do not provide efficient protection against viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Boiling especially leads to additional pollution and health issues through carbon emissions and problems to the respiratory system.
HELIOZ is an Austrian Social Enterprise active in the field of water disinfection and development of climate projects. Relying on its easy-to-use and environmentally friendly solution for water disinfection, the WADI device, HELIOZ is providing safe drinking water to thousands of families across India, Africa and South East Asia – creating high social, economic and environmental impact. WADI is designed for water treatment at the household level. A crucial point of action when it comes to preventing water-borne diseases, especially for the youngest community members under the age of five. A systematic study of various methods and strategies revealed that treatment of drinking water at home prevents 39% of diarrhea cases – compared to 11% when using improved water at the source.

By replacing the boiling of water by using firewood with the method of Solar Disinfection (SODIS) with WADI, HELIOZ is generating CO
 certificates for the voluntary carbon market. These certificates originating from premium climate projects offer a big range of co-benefits and are of high interest for corporates who want to communicate their carbon neutrality. 
The facts are clear: Climate Change has an accelerating impact on the big issues of our time, threatening the well-being and livelihoods of people around the world. The changing conditions lead to an additional threat to existing resources.
In India, 140,000 children die every year due to diarrhea alone. The cause? A lack of access to safe drinking water sources. In rural communities in Asia and Africa people still depend on limited, microbiologically contaminated water sources to satisfy their basic needs. Unfortunately, the most common method of water disinfection, boiling the water with firewood, results in high CO
 emissions – directly affecting the environment. In addition to being time-consuming and expensive for the people, widespread use also has dire effects on people’s respiratory health and local forest cover. Innovative and affordable solutions are needed to tackle the global water and climate crisis, improving people’s living conditions without creating dependencies and additional problems.
To mitigate global warming it is inevitable for companies to decrease carbon emissions. Currently there are industrial and corporate emissions which cannot be reduced or avoided, due to a lack of technical possibilities.
Companies can offset these unavoidable emissions by supporting climate projects that contribute to global CO
 reduction somewhere else. The consequence is that global pollution is reduced and global warming can be decelerated.
Creating positive environmental impact and integrating sustainability-based activities in the HELIOZ project design are key aspects of the operations.

While providing safe drinking water to rural households, HELIOZ is generating significant impact in the project region, leading to unique marketing content. Customers receive tailor made impact reports as well as human interest stories, photo and video material for social media channels enabling companies to add value to their brand and influencing global trends to conduct business responsibly. HELIOZ as a full-service provider is offering an above project-oriented approach to federal and state governments in India and selling its technology and know-how to international NGOs (e.g. Plan international, Welthungerhilfe)
Our projects will be certified under Gold Standard, the leading standard for verified emission rights (VER) guaranteeing the highest standard for CO
 certificates which are sold on the voluntary carbon market.

WADI foundation | HELIOZ Future Economy
WADI foundation of India aims to provide all people of India with easy access to safe drinking water. By implementing safe drinking water projects with HELIOZ's technology "WADI", the foundation wants to raise awareness and create actions that significantly improve the livelihoods of people living in rural India. 
Regional disparity causes unequal access to safe water
The National Family Health Survey (2019- 2021) of India highlights a regional gap in water supply across the country: While access to drinking water from improved sources has increased in the surveyed 22 states compared to the National Family Health Survey (2015-20163), rural areas lag behind urban areas. The prevalence of waterborne diseases leads to an estimated economic burden of approximately USD 600 million per year in India. In Madhya Pradesh, the largest forest state of India endowed with diverse forest resources, more than 60% of households don’t treat their drinking water and another 28% rely on cloth filtration.  According to the National Family Health Survey (2019-20216), access to clean fuel in rural areas (23.6%) is also significantly behind urban areas (84.3%).
WADI foundation follows a holistic project approach. We focus not just on providing communities with WADI as water treatment solution, we want to ensure that our projects generate real impact to all people involved. Therefore the basis of all our projects is built on 3 core principles:
WADI is a solar-powered UV measuring device that visualises the process of solar water disinfection (SODIS) in transparent bottles. WADI is placed next to bottles that are filled with contaminated water and exposed to the sun. Once the process is completed, a smiley face on the WADI confirms that the water is safe to drink.
WADI is approved by the WHO and meets their microbiological performance criteria. Solar water disinfection (SODIS) describes a natural process in which the sun‘s UV radiation eliminates harmful pathogens in water, such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa. The SODIS method was explored and developed by the Swiss water research institute Eawag and is recognised by both the WHO and UNICEF.
WADi foundation has an established network of local implementation partners. In accordance with our “train the trainer” concept, community workers are trained to create sustainability, further adding value to the regions.
All participating households are visited and supported by our implementation teams regularly throughout the project. We create and organize inclusive group meetings to enable community members to exchange their experiences and encourage them to share their devices to help support as many people as possible. We also implement comprehensive recycling measures, ensuring all bottles that have reached the end of their life cycle are disposed of and recycled properly.
Our sustainable project design and the systematic change of water treatment at a household level ensures a reduction of water-borne diseases and thus leads to a reduction of health costs per family. The reduction of sick days also increases the number of days spent at school and at work. We work hard on improving health and well-being for children and young adults through sensitizing communities on the causes of waterborne diseases and supporting long-term behaviour change. We work in local schools, support the building of water tanks, encourage awareness raising competitions and campaigns.
All of our activities make a positive contribution to climate protection. By using WADI, the CO2 emissions of each family are drastically reduced, and the deforestation of important forests is prevented, as the water no longer has to be boiled with firewood. We plant fruit trees which enable further reduction of CO2 emissions as well as embody a source of either food for own consumption or as goods to sell. We passionately focus on women empowerment, making women primary providers of safe drinking water which elevates their standing within their families. With every project we aim to make a true and long-lasting impact for the communities involved.
