Transforming the Migration System - Grant Round
We are now welcoming expressions of interest from organisations and communities working to transform the immigration system to ensure all migrants, regardless of immigration status, have dignity, power to shape change, and agency to determine the quality of their life, community, and future. 
This funding round seeks to strengthen the capacity of organisations led by, and working with, people of colour who are or have been temporary visa holders, people seeking asylum, and refugees. Tripple recognises that the current migration system is a product of white supremacy and is deeply rooted in racism and colonisation, and that justice for migrant communities is impossible to achieve in the absence of racial justice. 
We invite expressions of interest of no more than 200 words from organisations and communities committed to this important work. We value the work that you are doing more than your ability to complete an application form so we have endeavoured to keep the process as simple and efficient as possible. 
Click here for the expression of interest form. 
Initiatives that are led by and working with people of colour who are or have been temporary visa holders, people seeking asylum, and refugees working to transform the immigration system.

Transforming our public institutions to become significant investors in, and champions of, racial and social equity, and supporters of initiatives that address systemic inequalities in our society.
High-impact public interest litigation that benefits large numbers of people, leads to significant law reform, and raises public consciousness about important issues affecting migrant communities of colour, people seeking asylum and refugees.
Strategic communications and shifting the national narrative on migration in Australia:
Shaping media coverage of immigration to ensure that migrant communities of colour, people seeking asylum, and refugees voices and perspectives are represented fairly and accurately.
Storytelling, messaging research and strengthening positive narratives, public support, and building public will for migration policies that are just and inclusive.
Challenging ideologies, attitudes and movements within the migration system that encourage racism, sexism and xenophobia.
Building grassroots movements and, community and organisational power:
Developing core organisational infrastructure, which can involve capacity-building initiatives, including training, leadership development, and strategic planning.
Community organising, base-building, and leadership development initiatives that help to build sustainable and powerful movements for change.
Alliance building and forging coalitions and collaborations with other migrant and refugee organisations, or with other intersecting movement organisations, to build solidarity and advance shared goals.
Mobilising quickly to respond to a strategic crisis or opportunity within the immigration system. 
Activities must primarily take place in Australia and its territories, which includes territories where there are Australian detention centres. 
Organisations need to be not-for-profit focused but do not need to be registered on the ACNC.
We prefer that organisations are a registered legal entity, however we recognise that in some circumstances that is not possible due to visa status and/or regulatory requirements. If this is the case, please email or call our Philanthropy Lead at 
Recipients do not need to hold DGR status.
The total funding pool available is $150,000. 
The exact grant sizes will be determined based on the applicants, however we expect to grant: 
Please consider these amounts when submitting your EOI. 
The maximum grant amount an organisation can pitch for is $50,000. Each organisation can only apply for one grant. 
We encourage all applicants to factor in wellbeing, safety and sustainability costs in funding requests.
Tripple's guiding principles for this funding round:
 Tripple supports the creation of projects which utilise community strengths rather than highlighting problems.
 Tripple centres, trusts, and supports the leadership of directly impacted people, in particular those who are less visible, to lead the refugee, people seeking asylum and migrant justice movement, shape strategy, make decisions, and transform the systems that directly impact their lives. 
Tripple recognises that justice for migrant communities is impossible to achieve in the absence of racial justice. We prioritise support for organisations advocating for systemic change and anti-racist solutions promoting equitable power, access, opportunity, treatment, and outcomes for all people.
 Tripple strives to resource the work of the refugee and migrant rights movement more equitably. With the understanding that those closest to the problem are closest to the solution, Tripple structures our grantmaking to be more accessible to communities that have been historically marginalised and underrepresented in decision making processes, including those living at the intersections of multiple identities and compounding oppressions.
 Tripple prioritises support for collaborative efforts that deepen solidarity and alliances within refugees, people seeking asylum and migrant communities of colour and cross-movement collaboration between partners fighting for immigrant justice, racial justice, disability justice, climate justice, economic justice and other inclusive visions for society.
 Tripple knows that layered identities— of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, class, and economic, educational, and professional differences— can make people more vulnerable within the immigration system and society at large. We acknowledge these complexities and seek to understand them to inform thoughtful solutions.
If your work aligns with the ‘what we fund’ and eligibility criteria, please submit an expression of interest via the form below.

We have a meeting at the completion of the funding period to share learnings, reflections, impact, challenges, etc.
We don’t require written acquittal or progress reports at any stage, although you’re welcome to send us updates about your work if you wish to.
