Who is ClarkeHopkinsClarke, exactly? Pick apart our name and you find our founders: RMIT Architecture graduates Jack Clarke, David Hopkins and Les Clarke. Chalk and cheese. Unlikely friends. True believers in the power of architecture to connect people and communities, fulfil needs and enrich lives.
 was a legend of Australian Rules Football who captained The Bombers to their 1962 Flag and gave his brother Ron, the world-record-breaking distance runner, a run for his money in the fitness department. Jack was a one-off, reserved and hardworking. David Hopkins, on the other hand, was the quintessential extrovert: energetic, charismatic, mischievous. Les Clarke AM was the visionary and unofficial leader of the trio: curious, passionate, humble. He brought out those qualities in others, too, and was a cherished mentor to many of our current leaders right up until his retirement at age 80.
The founding Partners were people people, one and all. Optimistic, resourceful, creative. The ink was barely dry on their graduation certificates when they began Clarke & Associates from a small office in Hotham Street, East Melbourne, back in October 1960. By day they learned the ropes in graduate roles with established practices before making the leap into full-time private practice.

In the early years Jack ran the iconic 
. As a result Clarke & Associates were approached to design and build residential homes right across the country.
The SHS is a celebrated chapter in Australian architectural history. A collaboration between Boyd, the Royal Victoria Institute of Architects and The Age newspaper, its mission was to popularise modern home design in Australia’s suburbs. The service created economical architectural plans for well designed compact homes that did more with less and championed timeless passive design principles like good solar orientation and maximising living space and outdoor connectivity.
Each week, a house plan by an anonymous architect was published in The Age accompanied by a Boyd column discussing modern design and the new ways of living it allowed. Myer sold blueprints for five pounds each, ready for use by local builders in the new suburban subdivisions opening up at the time. The impact was staggering. It's estimated 5000 SHS homes were built, or around 15% of all homes constructed in Victoria at the time.. In his later years, keen to address negative impacts of suburban sprawl, Boyd embraced new medium density typologies. Architect and writer Rory Hyde speculates that these days Boyd would likely advocate for a Small Homes Adaptability Service. Architects would function a little like GPs, offering residents and neighbourhoods regular interventions over time to find creative ways to share space, energy and resources and evolve more caring, productive, self-supporting communities.

The trick? Never losing sight of the ultimate goal: happier, healthier people consciously embracing their interdependence on natural environments and thriving communities.
Our lens on the world has expanded, along with our sphere of influence. We’re now hosting industry events like the

Expanding into diverse sectors and multi-disciplinary projects started early at ClarkeHopkinsClarke. Les led the with way in the 1970s with a foray into educational design sparked by a disappointing search for an innovative school close to home for his daughter, Helen. “Design your own,” advised client and friend Bert Stevens AM, principal at Essendon Grammar, whose introductions got the ball rolling. The result was 
, a multi-award-winning school lauded for a progressive learning environment featuring strong links between interiors and landscape.
Eltham College (one of many longstanding clients, and the secondary school for the two boys of a current Partner) was born from the community consultation and specialist partnerships that became part of our practice DNA. It led to a string of celebrated projects including Gladstone Views Primary School that helped transform learning environment design in Victoria and beyond and pioneered project delivery by architects rather than governments.
In the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, ClarkeHopkinsClarke was actively involved with the Building the Education Revolution national stimulus initiative, delivering important projects at State, Catholic and Independent schools in suburban and regional areas. Later, ClarkeHopkinsClarke was selected by the Victorian State Government to create 15 Public Private Partnership schools – again, many in outer suburban and coastal towns – boosting community infrastructure and creating flexible activity hubs for new neighbourhoods. Current Partner 
 and, like his team, deeply engaged in award-winning design that creates unique environments shaped by each school’s particular pedagogical approach and community needs. Fellow Partner

Growth at ClarkeHopkinsClarke has been partly organic and partly strategic. Trusted relationships, inspiring collaborations and invitations too good to refuse led us naturally from homes to schools to community design. But after the recession of the early 1990s the practice consciously diversified to help weather further storms. Hence our embrace of technically challenging 
 that often involves elements of all these. Throughout this growth and diversity we’ve deliberately maintained focus on people and the communities and environments that nourish and sustain us all.

In 2021 we marked our 60
 birthday by taking the next step in our evolution as a practice: relocating to Melbourne Connect, a purpose-built innovation precinct on the former Royal Women’s Hospital site in Parkville. We’re thrilled to be anchor-tenants and the only architects invited to join this Property Council A-Grade Building with world-leading ESD credentials including a 6-star Green Star rating, 4.5-star NABRS water rating and 5-star NABRS energy rating and on-site rainwater harvesting and geothermal and solar energy. Led by Melbourne University and Lendlease, Melbourne Connect is a community of world-class researchers, industry, government, startups, students, SMEs and new institutions like Science Gallery Melbourne – all at the intersection of design and emerging technologies and driven to collaborate on socially responsible solutions to our most pressing shared challenges. As a practice determined to use business as a force for good we’ve found our tribe at Melbourne Connect. We’re thriving in a dynamic environment that’s all about elevating our collective impact.

The B in B Corp stands for “benefit,” and refers to businesses that benefit workers, the community and the environment. We have been a registered B Corp since 2016.
To gain certification, businesses must meet the highest verified standards of social and environmental performance, transparency, and accountability, to score at least 80 points out of a possible 200.
Being a B Corp is also about finding ways to ensure equal opportunities for all. From diversity of staff, ownership structures and engagement of third party suppliers.
