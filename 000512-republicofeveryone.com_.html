Who do you believe? - Republic of Everyone
You may have noticed we’re in a sustainability revolution.
Everywhere you look these days, there’s a brand or business championing its credentials.
We asked 2,000 Australians to tell us which brands they believe are acting to improve society and the planet; how that impacts what they buy, and who they want to work for; and what convinces them a company is walking the talk.
Read on for a sneak peek of what we found.
And if you can’t wait, you can read the full report here.

Power and the Passion - Republic of Everyone
We care a lot, but about what?
We asked 2,000 Australians to tell us about the social and environmental issues that matter most to them. We then looked at the actions we’re taking to improve them…and what we want from the brands and companies we buy from.
Read on for a sneak peek of what we found.
And if you can’t wait, you can read the full report here.
Unprompted, global warming is the #1 thing people call out as their biggest social or environmental concern.
When we take COVID out of the picture and ask people to choose from a list of 20 social and environmental issues,
Concerns are consistent across generations, with a couple of exceptions:
Who’s going to do something about all this?
We expect brands to act, too.
of us say brands and products should support causes or make changes to their products that address social and environmental issues
say they purchased a product (at least in part) within the last month because they thought it would help solve a social or environmental issue
So what are we buying better?
Takeaway in a box that I was able to put in the recycling instead of plastic which sits in a landfill for years
Fruit/veg that would otherwise have not be sold due to it not looking “pretty”
Took out house & contents insurance and by doing so, the company has pledged to plant a tree
I bought one of the reusable plastic/container lids that replace the traditional glad wrap
Peanut butter made from all Australian grown produce and made by a small Australian family owned manufacturer
Changed my brand of juice to Aussie owned – it’s something
I purchased cruelty free skin care where part of the money went to RSPCA
We’ve turned the study into two reports: one for interested individuals, and one for brand and marketing professionals. Let us know what you want, and we’ll send it straight to your inbox.

Posting pollutes. The average mailing creates around 39g of greenhouse gas and every year over 841 million parcels are sent across the country.
Sendle is 100% carbon neutral. Australia’s largest postal service is not. So how do you tell that story, and challenge the big guy to follow you?
Get a sticker, stick it on your parcel, snap it, tag it on social media and Sendle will carbon offset it…no matter who delivers it!
And an updated website to launch the campaign from and to.
And guess what? A few weeks into the campaign, Australia Post announced they would be going carbon neutral too.

But they don’t always know what makes their clothes so much better for people and planet. Patagonia challenged us to develop a brand campaign that makes sure everyone wearing the logo, knows what makes it special and builds on their mission, “we’re in business to save our home planet”.
Using key garments, we helped build the idea that championing the environment starts with better products.
By shining a light on what makes each garment special.
The campaign is short on words, big on impact.
All of which helps make sure that everyone wearing the logo knows what it means and, helps keep recruiting a new generation to buying less and better.
