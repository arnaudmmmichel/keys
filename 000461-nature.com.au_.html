meta title:Who we are - Nature
meta description:N/A

Nature is a 17-year-old agency with offices in Melbourne and Sydney. Over this time we have grown steadily to cater for growing demand, achieving an enviable record of both client and employee retention.
With a strong boutique ethos and working style, our guiding beliefs and principles are the same today as when we started. At their heart these are about putting our clients first and adapting around their needs, delivering on our promises, working collaboratively to produce great results, and fueling excellence through passion, curiosity and inquiring minds.
Nature is in the business of 
We’re the agency to work for if you’re after an employer who cares about your professional and personal development, if you want greater control over your success, want to exert greater influence over your environment, and if you want to be part of a winning team.
We’re the agency to work with if you’re after a partner that consistently delivers the methodological excellence and robust research and analytics needed to underpin important decisions, with insights delivered in an accessible easy-to-understand way. What really sets us apart, though, is the care and passion that supercharge the Nature approach to client service.
Committed to more than just our work
When Nature first started 17 years ago, we specialised in quantitative methods,  but we have since broadened our capability. Our diverse team of marketing scientists, brand strategists, qualitative researchers, quantitative consultants and data translators work together collaboratively on client engagements to create clarity for our clients and provide end-to-end capability across the majority of insights-related engagements.
As a business and a brand, people are at the heart of everything we do – from the people who work with us to the people we work for, and the people we aim to understand. Our whole business is built on solving tomorrow’s problems by better understanding people, and that flows through everything we do. 
We follow through on being people-first by implementing market-leading policies to provide the best opportunities for our people to learn, grow and thrive. We ensure our people do their bit to give back to others, share knowledge and respect our leadership position in the industry. 
Our culture is underpinned by five values:
Encouraging an owner's mindset in our team
Being absolutely committed to the individual growth and development of our people
Ensuring a collegial and collaborative way to work
Providing a safe, inclusive space to bring one’s full self to work
Adopting a caring mindset, expressed toward each other and the community
We love our craft and the substantive difference we make to our clients, but the higher purpose of helping create a better tomorrow for our community, the planet, and our people – as well as our clients – drives us strongly.  It provides meaning and fulfilment beyond the commercial, which also underpins the passion and enthusiasm of our team in all we do.   
We live and die by our actions, and we are proud of ours as they demonstrate commitment to our pro bono clients, the time our team spends on charitable causes, as well of course as our association with numerous NFPs such as St Kilda Mums, Fitted for Work, Movember, Safe Steps, WiRE, and the 
Our culture is one of collegiality and collaboration, which intentionally involves the sharing and challenging of ideas and points of view on the briefs we are tackling and how best to approach them.
If you have a curious and passionate mind and you’d like to be part of our team, we’d love to hear from you.

So, what does it mean to work at Nature?
At Nature, we make a point of staying true to the values that built our business and reputation. Each one of our five values is as important as the others. Living all values simultaneously is where the magic happens and where we do our best work.

meta description:N/A

Nature is in the business of informing tomorrow to help our clients solve complex questions. Part of that means being aware of our own impact on tomorrow.
We are determined to ensure that this impact is positive for our people, our community, and our environment.
We’re using business as a force for good.
Our goal is to operate in a socially responsible way by giving equal consideration to people, planet and profit.
To remain accountable to our commitment to tomorrow, we use the B Corp framework. This recognition involves a rigorous certification process that assesses an organisation's commitment to people and planet.  
Nature received B Corp certification in August 2022. We are now proud to be part of a global community of over 5,000 companies that are using the power of business for positive social and environmental change.
Certified B Corporations are for-profit companies that use the power of business to build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.
The certification process uses credible, comprehensive, transparent and independent standards of social and environmental performance. Companies are measured across five categories: governance, workers, customers, community and the environment. 
In order to achieve certification, a company must demonstrate high social and environmental performance by reaching a B Impact Assessment score of 80 or above.
For more information about B Corp certification, 
How to get B Corp Certification?
To receive B Corp certification, companies must complete the B Impact Assessment, which measures a company’s performance on environment, community, customers, suppliers, employees, and shareholders. Nature’s B Impact Assessment Score is 92. This is above the threshold score of 80 required to meet B Corp’s certification standards, and well above the median score of 50.9 for ordinary businesses who complete the assessment.

Nature works across industries, including a wide range of FMCG categories, financial services, retail, apparel, public transport, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals, utilities, insurance, and wealth management.
Our client has enjoyed an enviable position over the past two decades, growing from a simple start-up to a leading global digital player with strong brand equity, exceptional shareholder returns and incredible agility to investigate new ventures. 
To arrest declining share in a shrinking category, our client was looking to reinvigorate its offering through improvements to its core product and brand positioning. 
Our client, a leading financial services provider, was migrating customers to a new product over a 12-month period to align with the strategic direction of the business.
Our client, one of the leading Universities in Australia, was looking to understand a future state experience in a yet-to-be-built student precinct.
Previous research had identified that a significant number of people taking out general insurance were not aware of the finer details of their policy – resulting in significant issues for customers, providers and the industry, particularly at claims time.
Our client’s marketing team was challenged to broaden its category strategy with a shopper lens.

I would definitely recommend Nature in the future, as they have been a great provider of added insight, direction, and added value. I certainly consider Nature to be a highly valued strategic partner to our business”
Senior Consumer Insights Manager at Mondelez
“What we found in Nature was not just a research agency but a group of intelligent strategic thinkers who immersed themselves in our brand's problems and opportunities. The team at Nature became part of the team at Patties and whether that be for internal workshops or customer facing presentations, our partnership is born from a truly a collaborative approach, which is a credit to how Nature manage their client relationships”
“I've worked with Nature on a number of projects for the past six years and have always found them to be client focused with high levels of client engagement, easy to work with as they take the time to understand your business needs; and the data quality is outstanding“
Senior Insights Officer at Public Transport Victoria
“Nature’s difference lies in the people, who are energetic, experienced and inspiring. Nature do all the basics very well, but the team really excels when solving complex marketing problems, offering creative and innovative research solutions. They are the complete package.”
“Nature managed to start as a boutique company and retain that boutique-y feel. Really, they challenge us, they really force us to think further and get a better outcome.”
Head of Consumer Insights and Performance, Bega Dairy & Drinks
“I think the big difference in working with Nature is having constant access to senior leaders. They roll their sleeves up and they get involved in the day-to-day activity and are always visible and involved.”
“What you get with Nature is a team that has actually thought through your problem. They bring things you don’t expected or hadn’t thought of, with a strong commercial lens as well
General Manager, Strategic Program Delivery, Bulla Dairies
“A hallmark of my relationship with Nature across multiple businesses and categories is that regardless of the scale and complexity of the project, the service levels of the team, their interest and willingness go above and beyond is exceptional the whole way through. What also distinguishes Nature is just the elegant simplicity of storytelling and presenting data in a way that makes it easy to understand what to do with as opposed to what it says. I candidly don’t know how they do it but from the most senior members in the business who I’ve been dealing with for 5 years right through to new recruits. There’s clearly something in the water in the agency”

“What makes the Nature team really stand out is their ability not simply to design and run incredible research programs and deliver genuine insights; it’s their unique capability in taking that additional step - working with an organisation to embed the insight into the team. Bringing a spirit of true immersion and collaboration in the project we have worked on together has been a real treat for us. It has elevated this work from being a great project to an incredible one, which offers our business lasting value and utility.”
