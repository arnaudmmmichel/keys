Who we are - Our purpose | iPropeller
iPropeller offers boutique strategy consulting services. We attract clients who are eager to create innovative solutions to tough societal and environmental challenges. Solutions from which both business and society benefit.
We work with for-profit businesses, non-profit organisations, public authorities, civil society actors, and social-profit enterprises. What unites us with our diverse clients is the conviction that it is perfectly possible for an organisation to be normally profitable and a force for good in society.
We are change agents driven by “Do Good, Get Better”. We work with clients to reappraise business models, redesign operating models, leverage technology, unlock mindsets, engage employees, and recalibrate stakeholder relationships.

meta title:Our beliefs | iPropeller
meta description:We believe we can build a better world through sustainable business that provides value for all stakeholders. Three fundamental principles guide all actions at iPropeller: people, impact, and performance.

We believe we can build a better world through sustainable business that provides value for all stakeholders.
Three fundamental principles guide all actions at iPropeller:
Everything starts with people – all the people: our team members, our clients, our business partners, even our financiers. If you take care of people, they will take care of you and your business.
We share a strong, overarching ambition to make the world a much better place than it is today. With every action we take, we strive for having a positive impact on all the people whose life we touch.
We are called upon to perform and create value for all stakeholders. And as agents of positive change, we must also be the change we seek in the world.
Our well-being statement reflects our vision about what we can and should be:
“Our success is defined by an inclusive culture where each of us develops in harmony with oneself and others to create lasting societal value.” 
iPropeller is on a continuous journey toward making that vision a reality.

meta title:Our track record | iPropeller
meta description:Our founders were convinced that innovative entrepreneurs could play a vital role in tackling the large-scale challenges faced by the world, such as persistent poverty, a changing climate, rising inequality, dwindling biodiversity, and the spread of chronic diseases. That is why in 2007 they created iPropeller.

More than 10 years of being a force for good!
Our founders were convinced that innovative entrepreneurs could play a vital role in tackling the large-scale challenges faced by the world, such as persistent poverty, a changing climate, rising inequalities, dwindling biodiversity, and the spread of chronic diseases. That is why in 2007 they created iPropeller.
Public parlance has evolved since then – recall “corporate social responsibility”, “people-planet-profit”, “shared value” or “sustainable development goals”? Whatever terms have been in vogue, we have stayed faithful to our founding purpose: “Do Good, Get Better”.
Innovating towards business value and societal impact
For over 10 years we have been supporting companies to bring to market innovative products and services with a positive financial and societal impact. Think of reducing food waste, stimulating healthy eating habits, strengthening medication adherence, improving patient quality-of-life, enabling ageing-at-home, entering the renewable energy market, providing sustainable housing solutions for low-income families, giving health insurance coverage for chronic conditions, reducing the risk of bad debt for vulnerable households, enhancing public acceptance for large and necessary infrastructure projects, switching to eco-friendly packaging, building better relations with civil society, and more. We have done so for clients in a wide range of sectors, including food, life sciences, healthcare, financial services, telecommunications, retail, construction, energy and government.
Landmark achievements and B Corp Certification
Our achievements in the public domain include contributions to the establishment and growth of several emblematic social enterprises in Belgium and beyond; landmark research initiatives by the European institutions on the topic of social innovation and social entrepreneurship; the Business & Poverty Platform by a group of private sector companies and civil society organizations to tackle poverty in Belgium; and the conception and set-up of the 
, the most reputed platform for social innovation and social entrepreneurship in Flanders.
In 2018 we were awarded the 
, which sets the gold standard for good business. We are deeply proud of this achievement, while staying more than ever committed to making the world a better place by harnessing business as a force for good.

What we do - Our promise | iPropeller
A simple equation summarizes the promise we deliver to our clients:
Businesses have unique assets and capabilities for creating innovative solutions to pressing societal challenges. They can do so in a way that generates both business and societal value. Being a force for good must not be at the expense of profitability.
Among our clients are subsidiaries of multinational companies, small and medium-sized enterprises focusing on their domestic markets, public authorities at supranational, national, regional and local level, social-profit and non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, umbrella organizations, foundations, and social enterprises. We often partner with consortia of clients across the for-profit, social-profit and non-profit spectrum, collaborating towards common goals.

meta title:Our distinctive approach | iPropeller
meta description:Our way of working builds on our four unique capabilities: innovation at the core, co-creation across the spectrum, tested solutions at scale, and a personally committed team…

Our way of working builds on our four unique capabilities:
We know how to do good through innovative business models, products, services and processes. We bring ‘doing good’ from the periphery of the business to its center. We turn ‘doing good’ from an afterthought into a driving force. We go far beyond ensuring compliance and securing a permission-to-play. We create and capture value at the core.
We know how to mobilize organizations with diverse purposes yet complementary capabilities toward a common goal. We establish bridges between for-profit, social profit and non-profit organizations in support of innovative solutions. We provide access to hard-to-reach customer groups having oft neglected needs. We guard both the financial and societal bottom-line.
We know how to design, pilot, evaluate and scale innovative solutions. We manage an end-to-end process, from articulating the opportunity over field-testing the solution to readying the scale-up. We crowdsource viable ideas from social entrepreneurs, civil society organizations and other lead-users. We apply proprietary methodologies and proven approaches to address a societal or environmental need and secure an impactful outcome.
We know how to bring the best out of the combination of your team and ours. Each of our team members is authentically passionate about doing good for the world, and is genuinely convinced that business can be a force for good. Each of us is highly committed to work with you toward real-world solutions that have impact and create value.
