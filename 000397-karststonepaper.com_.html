Our design process starts with a simple question.
Made from 100% sustainably recycled stone, and without any bleaches or acids, Karst Stone Paper™ is rebuilt from first principles to be better than wood-pulp paper: more durable, more sustainable, and infinitely smoother to write, scribble, doodle or draw on.
We've never done things by the book
Made from sustainably recycled stone, and without any bleaches or acids, Karst Stone Paper™ is rebuilt from first principles to be better than wood-pulp paper: more durable, more sustainable, and infinitely smoother to write, scribble, doodle or draw on. If there’s a better way to make paper, we haven’t found it. And if we do, we’ll be sure to let you know.
Our paper baffles the senses. The lack of plant fibers and grain direction makes writing effortless and hand-cramp free. 
It’s possible to make paper without waste. Without chlorine or acid. Without water. Without trees. Made from recycled stone and without any bleaches, acids, or trees, Karst Stone Paper™ is rebuilt from first principles to be better.
That means more durable, more sustainable, and infinitely smoother to write, scribble, doodle or draw on. If there's a better way to make paper, we haven’t found it. Yet.
Our paper has a 60% smaller carbon footprint, and we offset the rest to make your purchase carbon neutral. Then to shift the needle back towards equilibrium, we plant a tree with every purchase via our aptly named partners One Tree Planted.
We keep all our colour natural.
Our paper is naturally bright white, never dyed or bleached with harsh chemicals like chlorine or acid. The subtle variation in colour comes from natural variations in stone, so each batch is unique to the next.
Calcium carbonate is one of the principal bases of superhydrophobic coatings. Which is a fancier way of saying that our stone paper is completely waterproof. So your morning coffee can’t ruin your eureka moment, and the rain can’t steal your thunder.
Our paper is made from calcium carbonate, a repurposed construction waste. Our process has been redesigned to eliminate elements of waste that would have been unavoidable in the traditional paper-making process.
Smoother doesn’t begin to describe it.
Our paper is unlike anything you’ve ever drawn on. Completely friction-free, pens glide across our pages because there is no grain direction, and ink never bleeds through. The result is a truly pleasurable writing experience.

Karst Stone Paper vs. Traditional Paper
Karst stone paper is an alternative to wood pulp paper that offers a superior writing experience and multiple environmental benefits. Our hope is that your notebook can serve as a foundation to do more and create more, responsibly.
Whether Elon likes it or not, we’re all going to have to live on this planet for a while yet. To us, that means living with it, too. Putting back some of what we’ve all taken. So, in addition to the environmental benefits of stone paper, Karst is B Corp Certified, has partnered with the One Tree Planted Foundation and is 100% Carbon Neutral.
