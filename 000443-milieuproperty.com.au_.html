A response to place from day one
Milieu, by definition, refers to the space or environment in which one lives or is influenced by. As a company, we’ve long been influenced by our environment, and we’re guided by a belief that our homes, neighbourhoods and surroundings aren’t merely observed, but are felt.
Founded in 2010, we are inspired by the culture of cities and each Milieu project is conceived to make a positive contribution to its setting. Through our diverse activities, we seek out opportunities to foster connection, explore innovation, cultivate the everyday culture of design, and enable a well-lived life.
Based in Melbourne, Australia, the Milieu Group includes, Milieu Property, 
. Part problem-solving, part curatorial process, we focus on weaving together the physical and intangible fabric that brings cities to life.
We view all projects as an opportunity to draw on our collaborators’ unique talents, explore new perspectives, elevate the standards of urban design, and advocate for more progressive ways of living.

Hospitality plays a pivotal role in our approach to cultural production. Whether it’s a dining venue beneath a Milieu residential project, a stand-alone restaurant, an event or a social initiative, we view hosting as an opportunity to enrich the day-to-day life of a neighbourhood.
Through Milieu Hospitality we stay connected to our projects and purchasers long after settlement.
Our culture is positive, collaborative and open. Expressed through initiatives that advocate for our approach, refine our understanding of the evolving context in which we work, and strengthen our connections with local communities, our culture guides every aspect of our business.
Our aim is to redefine development as a creative act

Every Milieu home is designed to complement the aesthetic, personality and individual spirit of the occupant. Our residents apply their own character to their apartments, demonstrating that a true living space is made from living. We invite you to share the beautiful homes of Milieu residents.
Dean and Sam at Peel by Milieu
Dean and Sam first heard about Milieu through friends in the design industry, immediately adding a layer of trust and comfort to their decision to buy an off-the-plan apartment.
      Dean and Sam at Peel by Milieu    
Lis at Nth Fitzroy by Milieu
Lis' spacious, dual aspect Nth Fitzroy home is a beautifully bold and perfectly executed ideal in melding vintage and modern design pieces with a healthy punch of colour and texture.⁠⁠
      Lis at Nth Fitzroy by Milieu    
Ellen and Sam at One Wilson Ave, Brunswick
Introduced to Milieu through family, One Wilson Ave offered Ellen and Sam the opportunity to right-size to a home filled with light and within close proximity to amenities—things they felt were lacking in their previous home.
      Ellen and Sam at One Wilson Ave, Brunswick    
Timothy at 223 Napier Street, Fitzroy
Nestled within Fitzroy's Golden Triangle, Timothy was initially drawn to the simple and relaxed material palette at 223 Napier that echos Australian modernism.
      Timothy at 223 Napier Street, Fitzroy    
Martina and Vince at Breese Street by Milieu
When considering a new home Martina and Vince were seeking a building that supports a sustainable way of living, enhancing their relationship with their neighbourhood with close proximity to services.
      Martina and Vince at Breese Street by Milieu    
The Johnson-Devery's at Nth Fitzroy by Milieu
“We flipped our mindset on a smaller place” says Patrick, of their decision to purchase in Milieu’s North Fitzroy development.

Lorri at Breese Street by Milieu
Lorri will forever hold the crown of Milieu's first repeat purchaser; upgrading from her Dight Street apartment to a large and airy two bedroom apartment at Breese Street.
      Lorri at Breese Street by Milieu    
Juliana at 223 Napier Street, Fitzroy
Juliana’s design background is undeniable with a bold and considered use of colour and texture engaged to personalise their space.
      Juliana at 223 Napier Street, Fitzroy    
Shin & Jess at 223 Napier Street, Fitzroy
With backgrounds in architecture and visual merchandising, Shin and Jessie's Napier Street apartment is a rich and unique representation of their Korean heritage, providing a vessel of sanctuary from the noise of the outside world. With the confidence of previous Milieu developments in the area, Shin and Jessie didn't think twice about buying off-the-plan and have created an impressive home that celebrates the thoughtful bones of the interior and truly captures their excellent design sensibilities.
      Shin & Jess at 223 Napier Street, Fitzroy    
Lorri at Dight Street by Milieu
Lorri's first Milieu purchase was an exercise in downsizing to an inner city sanctuary whilst still remaining connected to the vibrant community of Collingwood. An eclectic collection of artwork and furniture pieces comfortably fill the interior with a healthy dose of plants softening the edges of the muted interior.
      Lorri at Dight Street by Milieu    
After an extended period of living overseas, Ben was ready to move back to Melbourne in 2020. After hearing about Milieu through friends in the design industry, he knew we wanted to live in a Milieu development.
Jutta at 231 Napier Street, Fitzroy
After being introduced to Milieu by her son, Jutta found her forever home in a fully customised penthouse at 231 Napier Street, Fitzroy.

Milieu’s first project, 50 Moor Street was designed as a direct response to place and served as a benchmark for future work
Plant Street by Milieu is our first project in Melbourne’s leafy south-east suburb of Malvern. Developed in partnership with Penfold and MaxCap and working with some of Melbourne’s most progressive architects and designers, this is an opportunity for us to bring our innovative design approach to the city’s south, as part of our ongoing commitment to design focused creative development and Building Better Cities.
With equal focus on architecture, interiors and landscaping, Plant Street has been considered from a variety of perspectives to arrive at a truly cohesive design. Intended to unite internal and external spaces, the design centres on striking, textural and classically robust architecture, paired with warm, inviting and functional interiors, and softened by beautiful landscaping integrated throughout.
An exercise in balance and restraint, Plant Street is defined by solid, textural forms tempered by layers of greenery. Designed in collaboration with local architecture practice RITZ&GHOUGASSIAN, the building is underscored by a mix of bush hammered concrete panels and smooth slab edges that creates moments of depth and difference, while horizontal planes punctuate the façade at various heights.
Plant life envelops the building and internal open-air atrium to gently filter the streetscape without creating disconnection from the neighbourhood. This confluence of architectural detailing and thoughtful landscaping allows for generous views and apertures towards the surrounding gardens and nearby suburbs.
Designed by local studio Georgina Jeffries, these nurturing and light-filled spaces exemplify the curatorial approach the studio is known for. Elegant, tactile and highly functional, the material palette of honey timber joinery, brown ash brick, terrazzo and natural stone emanates warmth and welcome throughout. 
Custom-made lighting, designed by Brunswick East-based Volker Haug Studio, complements the material palette. Hand-picked by Georgina Jeffries, these pieces reflect the studio’s refined approach to design, which celebrates local craftspeople and prioritises lasting comfort.
Intended to soften the built form and unite the architecture, interiors and outdoor areas, the landscaping features a dynamic mix of deciduous plants and trees that will shift across the seasons. These tactile and emotive outdoor areas are crafted by Acre, an award-winning multidisciplinary practice based in Collingwood.
This relationship between the building and plant life is present at every level of the design. At ground floor, a dense yet soft layer of trees, plants and grasses extends naturally from the streetscape into the building’s open-air atrium. Beyond softening the architecture and complementing the neighbourhood’s surrounding flora, the landscaping evokes a sense of calm as residents enter and exit the building. Continuing this sentiment throughout the homes, ground floor apartments have generously landscaped gardens and upper-level dwellings have planters and creepers on their terraces.
Situated 10 kilometres south-east of the CBD, Malvern is known for its leafy streets, sprawling parklands and heritage architecture. Close to Malvern Road, Glenferrie Road and High Street, the building is connected to an excellent range of retail spaces, dining venues and community facilities, as well as public and private schools. While much of the area’s offerings are within walking distance of home, the area is well serviced by public transport, including a tram stop adjacent to the building.
In collaboration with emerging development practice Penfold and Capital Partner MaxCap Group, we’ve assembled a team of exceptional talent who share our values and complement our approach to design. This project will be designed in partnership with award winning architects RITZ&GHOUGASSIAN, small yet dextrous interior design practice Georgina Jeffries and esteemed landscape architects Acre. 
Additional contributions include lighting by local designer Volker Haug Studio, artwork by Melbourne gallery Otomys, and appliances by Swiss innovators V-ZUG.

Otter Place by Milieu represents a decade of creative development. It encapsulates and distils our socially-driven approach to urban living and it marks another step in our goal to cultivate an everyday culture of design in our cities. The design draws on our projects completed across the decade and gets to the heart of who we are, what we represent, and what we envision for urban development.
As Milieu’s new home, this building will be a tangible expression of our values. The essence of Milieu, and what we stand for, will be felt in each detail. Situated moment’s from Smith Street—the cultural and culinary heart of Fitzroy and Collingwood—this building is created in collaboration with international studio 
. As long-time residents of Otter Street, we’re proud to contribute to its streetscape and community. We’ve worked here for seven years—and we look forward to many more.

Hassell is a multidisciplinary design practice with a global reputation for innovative, socially-driven architecture. With significant experience across the UK, Asia and Australia, the studio is well regarded for large scale, complex civic, cultural and public works. In this rare residential project, Hassell has applied that same thoughtful and rigorous approach to Otter Place.
Assembled in two distinct forms, this building reflects and celebrates its local surroundings. Composed in brick, the lower levels are a nod to the masonry of the industrial architecture throughout the area, while the simple, elegant glass form above captures, reflects and amplifies the shape and detailing of neighbouring buildings.

As our sixth project in partnership with 
, Otter Place is the result of a decade of experimentation and refinement. Guided by an elevated yet functional design response, the interiors are assembled with distinguished materials and complemented by flexible layouts suited to modern living.
Taking cues from the simple yet effective styling of gallery spaces, the interiors are well planned and thoughtfully detailed, utilising smart technology throughout.
