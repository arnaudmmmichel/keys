The most loved underwear on the planet
The fabric feels beautiful and extremely comfy.
My husband finds these really comfortable, breathable and smooth. Great all day wear!
As a 16D bralettes like this don’t often give me enough support or coverage, but this one is so comfy!
Great - love the fabric, colour, length and thickness of these socks. Super comfortable.
These shorts are the perfect fit and feel, I love to get into them when I get home from work and wear them around the house in summer. SO SOFT!!!
Just as comfortable as you would expect with a Boody product and provides that extra bit of support to give a nice bust shape for the fuller busted person.
Love these pants! The feel of the material is amazing against your skin and they are as comfy as track pants but stylish enough to wear out and about.
Just the right thickness for mid season wear.
Hands down, best I’ve ever bought. Incredibly soft and comfortable. I ended up buying 3 pairs and will buy more.
Great colour, perfect fit, just as in the photos. Another reliable Boody buy.
Good for you & the planet 
We're so confident you'll love the comfort and fit of Boody that we will gladly refund the purchase price of your first pair of socks or underwear if you're not 100% satisfied within 30 days of your purchase.
We’re Australia's first B Corp certified underwear brand, recognised in the top 5% of B Corps globally and endorsed by Dr Jane Goodall. On a mission to help people reduce their negative impact on the planet from the bottom up, we emphasise quality, simplicity and sustainability in everything we do.
Bamboo was chosen as our hero fabric deliberately for its comfort, breathability and softness. It has so many natural benefits including being anti-bacterial, thermoregulating and odour-resistant - all ideal properties for garments that sit so close to the skin everyday.
We’re loved globally and sold in over 15 countries. Having received over 56,000 5-star ratings, our community is a huge part of what we do. We love seeing you tag Boody on social, learning how it makes you feel and seeing our community love grow. Mentioned in Vogue & Harpers Bazaar, Boody is also gaining celebrity love, seen on Bella Hadid and Billie Eilish.
that’s as easy as changing your underwear.”
As a brand built on sustainable values, badges like this are a constant reminder of why we do, what we do
For too long, we’ve seen an unrealistic portrait of women who menstruate and leak.
Sometimes, especially when we’re in pain or feeling fragile, it’s okay to just be.
Introducing our Period and Leak-proof underwear campaign, #DoLess
Ahh, your top drawer - an easy and great place to start your eco swaps. Did you know? Your skin is the largest organ for absorption, so what you put on your body is just as important as what you put in it. No pesticides, insecticides or fertilisers - bamboo is naturally organic and doesn’t require chemicals to enhance its growth. Bamboo fibre smoothly falls into place in its weave, leaving gaps open for air to flow freely.
So, you have heard the term zero-waste and you’re interested to learn more.
A zero-waste lifestyle is about being mindful and considered in your everyday actions.
Did you know that sleep is the third pillar of health? Nutrition, exercise and sleep combined are crucial to healthy living. What is also important to note though, is that sleep is often a forgotten aspect of one's health. In the pursuit of eating right, exercising and making time to relax, it is sleep that can often fall to the wayside and not truly considered in your wellness routine.
One person who knows a thing or two about mindfulness is Laura Kelly, yoga and meditation teacher. From her spiritual journey to her favourite Boody picks, read on to get to know Laura Kelly in our interview.

What do I do if I have a faulty Boody product?
Oh no! This isn’t good but we’d really appreciate it if you could let us know about this by reaching out to our team on 
. We’ll make sure this is resolved with you.
Can you tell me about Boody?
 to find out all about us.
Our badges of honour can be found right 
Great question and there are a whole tonne of reasons! Enough to list separately over 
What does Boody have in place to ensure safe and ethical working practices?
A fundamental pillar of Boody is our approach to ethical sourcing and production. The Boody Code of Conduct defines our expectations of Boody Production Partners to meet ethical manufacturing requirements so the workers and the environment are respected and cared for. The Boody Code of Conduct can be found 
Our products are crafted in China, Vietnam or India. We hold all of our suppliers to the highest standards for environmental and labour practices and are proud of how our factory workers are treated, and of the responsible approach we take to manufacturing with minimal environmental impact. See more 
Boody is slightly more form-fitting which can explain the snug feeling but with this in mind, our products do tend to shape to your body. We do recommend going up a size should you find yourself to be in-between sizes. For our Lounge range however, you may prefer to size down as these are already intended for comfort.
What is Boody Lounge sizing like?
These styles are designed to have an oversized and relaxed fit - perfect to help find your downtime. Go for your usual size if you prefer an oversized look and go down a size for a more snug fit." Our personal recommendation would be if you're in between sizes to size down (rather than up like other Boody products) and if you're going off your size from our undies/leggings the current size would be fine but you could also get away with sizing down for a more "streamlined" look.
How do I find out the fabric composition of a Boody product?
We are all about the functionality of our products and we choose the best fabric mix accordingly. If you'd like to see the composition of any Boody product, you'll find it under the 'Fabric and Care' tab underneath the images,
How do I wash my Boody?
We recommend a warm machine wash with similar colours, using a gentle bio-degradable detergent. Boody can be dried in the sun however in order to best colours vivid, we'd say to dry your beloved items in the shade. If you need to tumble dry, please use the lowest setting, or set to 'delicates'. Iron on a low setting, do not dry clean.
While hand washing is ideal, a gentle machine wash and spin is best to preserve the original aspect of our Padded Shaper Crop Bra. We recommend that you ditch the clothes dryer as the heat will break down any elastics and can simply cause dimpling in your padding. For these reasons, we also recommend that you simply take out removable padding before washing.
Our undies can take a few washes before panty liners stick to them - generally 3 - 8!
Can I find Boody in a store?
We’re a global brand and hope now matter where on our beautiful planet you are there can be a Boody stockist near  you. To find out, head to our Store Locator 
No worries reach out to our team on 
 and we’ll love to get you a (human) answer

 These coins can be redeemed for rewards immediately.
These coins need to be verified before you can redeem them. This typically applies to purchases and referrals. The approval period is 30 days which corresponds to our 30-day window for returns.
CAN I EARN COMFORT COINS IF I PAY WITH A GIFT CARD?
We award coins for gift cards purchased. 
However, you unfortunately cannot earn coins for all or part of your order paid with a gift card.
CAN I PURCHASE A GIFT CARD USING MY COINS?
As coins are redeemed as a discount at checkout, and not a form of payment, coins can not be used to purchase a gift card.
