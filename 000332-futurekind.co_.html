It has been a pleasure to work with Futurekind as our valued marketing and advertising partner. Futurekind has been exceptional... [delivering] on-promise and understanding our needs with timely and professional execution. 
...your clear insights and understanding of our business has shown a deep caring for our growth in the way we had hoped and intended.
— Paul Benhaim, Founder Hemp Foods Australia (Elixinol Group)
It has been an absolute pleasure to work with Seb and his team. With world class creative & strategy and also fun to work with - what sets Futurekind apart from many other creative agencies I’ve worked with is a commitment to purpose alongside really exceptional work.
As our lead agency at SumoSalad, Futurekind have been integral in leading the creative, strategy and media for each of our seasonal campaigns over the last couple of years. Some of their stand out work has included the concepting and delivery of the Spring campaign, This Is How I Flex - with direction and production of 3 brilliant video commercials featuring Commando Steve, Erin Holland and Dr Zac Turner.
Seb and his team have demonstrated a deep care for the people and businesses they work with - showing compassion, integrity and inspiration in their dealings. They have consistently gone above and beyond when the pressure is on, in doing so helping us to achieve outstanding results... and I can’t recommend them highly enough.

With extremely limited time and a strict budget, Futurekind were able to pull together an entire production, delivering content that was extremely high quality, and providing a complete promotional solution to help drive our product sales. They are a great team to work with.

Futurekind put a strategy together for the growth of the radio station, which helped us grow our audience from 55,000 listeners to 97,000 listeners in one month and get much better engagement with our social media platforms
Seb and the Futurekind team have gone absolutely above and beyond, exceeded my expectations, and over delivered at every possible turn! I couldn’t recommend Futurekind highly enough and look forward to working with them on ‘future’ projects
‘Switched-On’ is the phrase that comes to mind when I think about Futurekind, Seb and his team. [they’ve] provided every possible support for RecycleSmart - creative, strategy, social media, campaign management, tactical and commercial support, deal structuring and proactively offering their key personal and professional networks to assist in every way possible. Above all, I was impressed with Seb’s ability to commit to the success of my business and bring its values to life. Futurekind would be a true asset for any purpose-driven business or enterprise wanting to make its mark. Seb and his team come with my heartfelt recommendation. 
Futurekind are like a breath of fresh air!
