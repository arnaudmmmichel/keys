Practice management software and 24-hour customer support for free?
Yes, and it's not too good to be true, it’s simply our business model. In fact, half of our users don't pay for anything in Halaxy, and that's completely fine with us - our mission is to provide software that makes healthcare better for everyone everywhere.
We’d prefer to be making a little bit of money from many people rather than a lot of money from a few. This way we can help as many people as possible!
Yes, Halaxy is free, but that doesn't mean you're missing out or compromising on quality. In fact, Halaxy has built a reputation for being one of the world's best health technologies - and we provide real-time phone and email support 24 hours a day, Monday to Friday!
We're one of the largest providers of practice and patient management software in Australia, with more than 50,000 happy practitioners signed up to Halaxy and almost 5 million patients treated monthly.
Halaxy is also free for patients
Halaxy's Personal Health Record (PHR), also known as the Patient Portal, is an online hub linked to your Halaxy account that allows your patients to manage their health at home and securely share medical information with their care network.
Halaxy calendar: It keeps working while you take a break
Worrying about work when you should be enjoying a break is no fun. But knowing that your Halaxy Calendar manages everything for you, and that you can access it anywhere anytime is what real peace of mind is about 
Appointment Journey: How to use Halaxy's clinical features in your practice
By using Halaxy's clinical features before, during and after the appointment, you not only save time during the actual appointment but also improve your patient's experience and outcomes in the long run. 
Auto Payments: Save 4 minutes per appointment and boost your practice's revenue
Halaxy is the only practice management software that can process patient appointment fee payments automatically, saving you 4 minutes per appointment. Check the case study to see how our payment rates and service compare!
