Super happy with product. Have been using for a few months now. Love the fragrance. 
Absolutely the best shower gel I have ever used. Had to repalce my last order as I can't get enough of it. Cannot recommend enough. I won't use anything else again!
Stuff Cedar and Spice Full Body Wash is Spicier than a Pink Flamingo Shower Cap! I love the consistency, the lather and the smell is fantastic! Manly and nothing like all the crap you find in the supermarkets marketed towards men. It lasts too leaving you feeling washed, fresh and ready to be Spicy! Woohoo! Will be buying again! Cheers! 
Smells so manly and unlike all the other chemical filled crap, the smell actually stays with you, plus, it feels great on your skin. Will definitely be buying more
This is a simply great product that smells terrific and makes your skin feel alive. I love this stuff
Use this daily, make a bigger pack size as you go through it quick if you also use it as a shampoo
I only bought the small bottle as I have always been a soap person. I am really impressed with how much it lathers up and gets me clean. Great product and I am happy to support the cause. 
Wish I could get this at the shops. Such a good product
Love this! As you can see, there is already a new, bigger bottle ready for when the previous one runs out!!
Smells great, feels great. Even my 11 year old loves it. He actually stays in the shower for more than 3 seconds now!!
This thing looks so cool in my shower, great packaging
Love the smell and way it feels on my skin. 
Smells great, like that I can match it up with the Deo having the same scent
Smells warm and woody, really nice and different to the usual stuff we get
Smells good, supports charity, Aussie made. I love the STUFF!
Tried this at a friend’s house and loved it. Such great packaging and fresh feels and fragrance. Bought it in a bundle and it gives me a lift each day. 
Great product smells great was a present for my son in law he absolutely loves 
Love that this replaces 2 products in my shower. Just need you guys to get a conditioner into your range!
This Stuff is fantastic !! Best stuff I have ever used for my head and body. Wish I had known about This stuff before 
Foams up nice, smells good! What else do you need?
But omg terrible logistics in terms of ordering and receiving 
So great - even my mum loves it so had to buy her one. 
I was looking for a men's shower wash for gifts for the men in my family. Looking online I found your product and it seemed perfect. The order arrived promptly and I was pleasantly surprised by your great customer service. I'm sure it will be popular with my family members. Wishing you great success and a safe and merry xmas.
So good, I just wish it came in a bottle 3 times the size or you did plastic free refills! 
It’s fair to say this has improved my chances, I smell awesome!!!
Got this from my Mum and use it everyday
Spearmint and Pine body wash smells great and leaves you feeling fresh!
It’s fair to say this has improved my chances, I smell awesome!!!
Fantastic smell, great wash and so easy to get it delivered. The deodorant has a great smell as well. Hooked on it already.
Super cool body wash, have been using this the last month and love it. I have sensitive skin and doesn't irritate me at all
Loving this head and body wash - will certainly be purchasing more!!

This is deodorant. It won’t make potential lovers magically flock to you, but it lasts long, smells nice and keeps those nervous sweats in order. What more do you want? A clean formula too? Well, you’re in luck as this flashy AF deo is free from aluminium and parabens.
Find full list of ingredients here.
 Remove lid, aim for pit (you can’t miss), and swipe as desired. Works best after bathing and before you put your shirt on. Also works well if you can’t make it to the shower and need a speedy refresh. Throw one in your gym bag, desk drawer, uni bag, car console, etc etc, you get the idea.

Son says it's smells good an not sticky good
I had quiet bad irritation from other aerosol deoderant and after using “Stuff for your pits”  I have cleared up all rashes and never smelt better. Great product and the body wash is also something I recommend. Smells unreal! 
Brought for a friend he loved it
I have an aluminium allergy so Stuff is ideal for me as it's all natural, lasts a long time even at the Gym and rolls on smoothly. I also love the scent, much nicer than the supermarket type of deoderants.
Love this deo! Takes a bit of getting used to if you're used to the antiperspirant ones. But after a week of using it i'm sold and won't be going back!
Great value, lasts a surprisingly long time compared to the aerosol options.
Love the smell of this deo, reminds me of some of the Aesop colognes with its woodyness
I have been enjoying using my Stuff deodorant, keeps me fresh all day.  However now it appears my sons' have also taken a liking to MY Stuff.  Wish I had stuff when I was a teenager.
I recently made the switch over to natural deo and really impressed so far. You will sweat a bit more, but won't smell and my armpits have felt really smooth, not the usual irritation you get with spray ons.
I've been having massive issues with irritated armpits so made the switch to this aluminium free deo, has been doing the trick so far! Armpits are back to normal, and havent missed the anti-perspirant spray on so far
Just getting used to the ball roller. Apart from that, nice smell and it works all day, even after a hard workout. 
Hard to find a good natural underarm think this is quiet good, tho may need to apply twice a day if you are working up a sweat. 
Takes a bit of getting used to, but am now hooked on this deo
My new favourite deodorant! Got this at 30% off at woolies
Great all natural, roll on deodorant. Awesome scent & long lasting properties 
Can feel a little wet initially but I'm really liking this product now I'm used to it
Smells good and love that the proceeds go to charity
Such a nice smell! So many men's deos fall into the fresh/sporty fragrance profile so its great to use something a little different.
Massive fan of this brand and these deos!
As a man enters the forest in search of the darkest part of the forest to him. He discovers part of himself that smelt terrible and needed some protection. His awakening moment was when his armpits stank and discovered he is the forest himself and is walking the cedar spice path.  4/5 would recommend.
Finally found a natural deodorant that actually works. This scent is great and lasts me all day. 
the pits have never smelled better, it's great to have a deo with a natural scent. Also my white t-shirts underarms are actually staying white - an absolute godSCENT! 
The scents seem nice - but blokey on the description of your product. Seems unprofessional 
Finally found a natural deodorant that actually works. This scent is great and lasts me all day.
Good deodorant, not as irritating as rexona which I used to use. Would recommend it to friends

Do you need stuff for the shower? For your face? How about your hair, pits and, ah, other bits? Then this is your lucky day because we’ve got you sorted: you’ll be looking and feeling the goods in no time. And the best bit? Buying STUFF helps fund life-changing mental health programs through our charity partner, The Man Cave.
Check out the video to see how buying STUFF positively impacts hundreds of boys.
 are all supercharged with fresh ‘n spicy botanicals. Not only are our products Australian made, vegan and cruelty-free, they also feature no B.S nasty ingredients (such as parabens and aluminium). Our bottles are made from recycled plastics and are recyclable too, meaning the good stuff doesn’t become bad stuff the moment you’re done with it. 
, a leading preventative mental health and emotional intelligence service for young men. 
For every $1000 in sales, STUFF sponsors one boy to experience one of The Man Cave's life-changing mental health programs.
As a large shareholder of STUFF, The Man Cave will have a sustainable revenue stream to continue scaling their important work to the communities who need it most. How good!
STUFF is proud as punch to welcome Olympic champion Ian Thorpe into the fold as an investor and ambassador.
“I believe passionately in STUFF’s mission to support men as they navigate a new era of healthy masculinity.”
“None of us are immune to the challenges of mental health, myself included. It’s refreshing to work with a brand that embraces both product and purpose to achieve real change in this area.”

Back in 2017, I was sitting in a cafe with one of my great mates (and co-founder of The Man Cave). We were due to give a presentation to a local school on purpose-driven businesses and, true to form, we weren’t nearly as prepared as we should’ve been. 
We began rattling off brands and realised that there was nothing in the masculinity space that was really driven by purpose. Not only that, none of these brands actually reflected us or the people we knew. It was all old-school, outdated stereotypes that were cringeworthy to watch.
We saw a massive opportunity to create a brand that represented a more modern, authentic masculinity and one that was built with social impact at its core. Drum roll please…introducing STUFF, a personal care brand which had our charity, The Man Cave, as a majority shareholder.
Right now, it’s a pretty confusing time to be a man with mixed messages coming from every direction. So alongside creating high quality products, our goal for STUFF is to support men as they navigate a new era of masculinity so that we can create a movement of men living a life of connection, purpose and positive impact.
Uncomplicated STUFF for men, with purpose.

No, never! Our products are 100% cruelty-free and vegan. We do however, regularly engage dog models to feature in our campaigns. They are willing participants and we pay for their services in the form of tasty treats.
The good STUFF is manufactured in Australia.
We’re very proud to say that there are no BS nasty ingredients such as parabens and aluminum in any of our products. Also, our final formulations went through rigorous rounds of testing via the rigs, hair and pits of our friends at The Man Cave. They tested the goods, and felt the goods too! It all had to be poifect. You can find the full list of ingredients on each individual product below.
How much of each product should I use?
Well, that all depends on the size of your scone and height of your ‘fro, but roughly speaking: 1-2 pumps of the Face Wash and 2-3 pumps of the Head and Body Wash. That should provide a nice amount of lather.
What about those fresh n’ spicy roll-on deodorants? That’s got us stumped TBH. That’ll depend on armpit meterage multiplied by sweatiness and times that by speed of swipe. So, we’ll leave that up to the armpit owner to work out. 
How often? We recommend that you wash both your face and body daily. Why can’t I just use water? Great question. You wouldn’t just wash your dinner plate or your car with water. Same goes for your hair and skin. If dirt, sunscreen, souvlaki grease and so forth doesn’t get removed then you’re up for all kinds of damage bills: blocked pores, blackheads, breakouts etc.
Can I use this STUFF if I have sensitive skin?
All our formulations are designed for everyday use and to suit a variety of skin types and conditions. That said, it’s always a smart idea to patch test a small amount of product on the skin of your arm. Please consult your dermatologist if you have any concerns. 
How do I recycle my STUFF?
With your deo, pop the ball out and give the inside a quick rinse and then you can whack both the bottle and ball into your council recycling bin. 
With your bottle, unscrew the pump top and give the bottle a ‘lil rinse before popping that into your council recycling bin. 
*Make sure the pump goes into the rubbish bin as local councils are unable to recycle them.
