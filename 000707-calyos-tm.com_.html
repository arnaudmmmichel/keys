Calyos is a leading expert in two-phase heat transfer technologies
In 2014 Calyos set about achieving our mission to provide sustainable, passive, two-phase cooling solutions. Calyos is a spin-off from 
, who successfully developed similar two-phase technologies for the space industry. Initially our research and development focused on adapting the technologies for earth applications, including moving to a flat evaporator and utilising a dielectric working fluid. Calyos now produces solutions primarily targeted at batteries, power electronics and processor cooling.
Calyos believes in two-phase cooling because this technology brings a clear set of benefits to our customers
Calyos specializes in using a dielectric, green refrigerant, removing the risk of short-circuits in the event of damage.
Our products are helium tested for tightness before they leave our factory, ensuring long lifetimes and zero maintenance.
All of our two-phase technologies harness the waste heat to vaporize a fluid, using the problem to power the solution.
By being 100% passive and having no pumps it removes the most common point of failure in liquid cooling systems. 
Vaporizing a fluid is an incredibly efficient and results in systems with extremely low thermal resistances.
We make applying these advanced heat pipe technologies feasible
We produce the best wick structures that provide the maximum pumping capacity (and therefore performance).
Built from real-world data we have created accurate in-house models. Plus we use standard software where possible.
Typically we use R1233zd(E), a low GWP (<1), dielectric, non-toxic and non-flammable refrigerant. Other fluids are available.
Built for small series production and prototyping it allows us to work efficiently and react quickly as it is side by side with our design team.
Experts in adapting the solutions to your application, without which the value of two-phase cooling cannot be delivered.
Calyosâ dedicated test engineers can provide advanced thermal testing of prototypes and solutions, replicating real-world scenarios.
Ideal for static applications such as charging infrastructure, our unique heat pipe solution is a little different from traditional heat pipes. Thanks to our expertise in two-phase technologies we are able to use our grooved wick structure in combination with a unique mechanical design to provide the best cost to performance ratio. 
loop heat pipe for power electronics
Utilizing our flagship technology, our solution offers the only passive alternative to direct water cooling. It is ready for the latest, high-heat density (GaN & SiC) components and can be deployed either by combining with, or by replacing an existing cooling system. Our solution provides an ultra-reliable, maintenance free, long-lifetime power electronics cooling solution.
loop heat pipe for embedded electronics
This is the most flexible solution for cooling embedded electronics on the market. Ultra reliable and maintenance free, our solution is ideal for even the most harsh environments. The system is able to access any remote cold source no matter the size or type.
loop heat pipe for data center servers
Our trusted flagship technology has long been deployed in server environments and more recently we have expanded into the telecommunications market. Calyos utilises standard components to build a solution specific to your mechanical design, with our inherent fit-and-forget reliability.
loop heat pipe for data center racks
Calyos aims to accelerate the sustainable transition of data centers from air cooling to full liquid cooling, notably enabling heat recovery capabilities. The inevitable next step for our product development is to transition our technology from single server to full rack cooling.
micro channel heat pipe for batteries
Placed in between cells, these tiny heat pipes can assist in both warming and cooling cells. The cross sectional shape can be completely customised and these solutions are incredibly cost effective to mass produce. Using a dielectric refrigerant inside removes the risk of short circuits, maintaining Calyos' fit-and-forget reliability.
Thermal challenges used to be resolved easily with a simple, solid heat sink. Fast forward to today and we have exhausted the design possibilities of traditional heat sinks. As electronic technology reduces in size it increases in heat density requiring more and more powerful thermal systems to dissipate this heat. With the rapid and continuing rise of electrification and data processing, thermal management of electronics faces rapid demands. In combination with the demand for sustainable, environmentally friendly solutions Calyos is in a unique position offering 100% passive thermal solutions in a market of pumped liquid cooling.
Thermal management is the most critical reliability factor for electronic components. A good thermal system extends the lifetime and increases the performance of both processors and power electronics.
Both power electronics and battery cooling are critical to the speed and efficiency of a vehicles charging time. Cooling affects both components inside the vehicle and the charging infrastructure itself.
Waste heat from data centers is typically released into the ambient air. Heat recovery provides the opportunity to heat greenhouses or residential buildings, reducing the data centers environmental impact.
Typically EVs use up precious energy to power their cooling systems. Switching to passive cooling can save this power for the e-motor increasing the range of any type of hybrid or full electric vehicle.

Get your free initial feasibility study 
to provide you with estimates for the thermal performance, mechanical design, and cost. 
With no moving parts, our solutions are extremely reliable and inherently maintenance free.Â Therefore they are ideal for reliability critical environments.
Our systems simply operate when heat is applied, adjusting their performance depending on the amount of heat to dissipate. There is no control system to potentially breakdown or fail.
By vaporising a fluid our systems have the potential to be the most efficient form of heat transfer. For you this means the lowest thermal resistance.
Once the specification is validated, heat pipes are a simple solution with a low unit cost, proving them to be a popular option for static applications.
The beauty of two-phase is the ability to harness the latent heat of vaporisation, using it to power the cooling system is the most sustainable solution.
When heat is applied to a section of the heat pipe it causes the liquid inside to vaporise.
This vapour then flows up the center of the tube as it is the path of least resistance against gravity.
The vapor condenses back into a liquid due to the temperature difference of the cold section.
The wick structure on the inside of the tube assists the liquid in returning to the heated section for the process to repeat.
Our ability to innovate is fundamental to our mission. Applying our world-leading two-phase knowledge and experience we design the best passive thermal management solutions.
The wick structure enables the return of the liquid. In traditional heat pipes it can be a grooved structure, unlike loop heat pipes that are more complex.
Calyos typically use a safe, green, dielectric refrigerant r1233zd(E) as its Global Warming Potential is <1. Plus we have experience using other fluids as required for different applications.
Our skillset is in customizing two-phase solutions to maximize the performance while making sure they are non-invasive and easy to adopt.

The only 100% passive alternative to active (pumped) water cooling.
We remove the risk of damage from costly water leaks using a dielectric fluid. Downtime is also reduced by removing the need for a pump.
By vaporizing a fluid our systems have the potential to be the most efficient form of heat transfer. For you this means the lowest thermal resistance.
Our systems simply operate when heat is applied, adjusting their performance depending on the amount of heat to dissipate. There is no control system to potentially breakdown or fail.
LHPs are unique in their ability to operate against accelerations. This provides one of the only passive, two-phase solution to operate under such conditions.
Our systems can scale to your requirements. It doesn't matter the number of heat sources, thermal power, transport distance, or physical size.
The beauty of two-phase is the ability to harness the latent heat of vaporization, using it to power the cooling system, making it the most sustainable solution.
The porous wick structure inside the 
absorbs the incoming liquid and pumps it towards the baseplate creating the capillary pumping force to move fluid around the system passively.
The liquid evaporates as it contacts the baseplate as it is in contact with the heat source and therefore conducting heat. The vapour exits down the 
The vapour continues to the cold source and condenses back into a liquid due to the temperature difference. The liquid then flows back to the evaporator down the 
This process continues indefinitely when heat is applied to the evaporator baseplate and the

Our ability to innovate is fundamental to our mission. Applying our world-leading two-phase knowledge and experience we design the best passive thermal management solutions.
The wick structure, including a patented micro-layer are the critical elements Calyos has mastered and they provide the best pumping capability of any LHP evaporator made today.

to provide you with estimates for the thermal performance, mechanical design, and cost. 
This complex new technology has great potential for many applications.
With no moving parts, our solutions are extremely reliable and inherently maintenance free.Â Therefore they are ideal for reliability critical environments.
Our systems simply operate when heat is applied, adjusting their performance depending on the amount of heat to dissipate. There is no control system to potentially breakdown or fail.
By vaporising a fluid our systems have the potential to be the most efficient form of heat transfer. For you this means the lowest thermal resistance.
PHPs are unique in their ability to operate against accelerations. This provides one of the only passive, two-phase solution to operate under such conditions.
The beauty of two-phase is the ability to harness the latent heat of vaporisation, using it to power the cooling system is the most sustainable solution.
When heat is applied to the pulsating heat pipe it causes liquid to vaporise and therefore vapour plugs inside the heat area expand.
As the vapour plugs expand it causes pressure instabilities in the heat area in turn causing the fluid inside to oscillate (or pulsate).
Due to a lower temperature the vapour condenses back into a liquid, expanding the liquid slugs inside the cold area.
This expansion and contraction of the liquid and vapour inside causes repeated stochastic movement of the fluid maintaining the heat transfer.
Our ability to innovate is fundamental to our mission. Applying our world-leading two-phase knowledge and experience we design the best passive thermal management solutions.
Calyos has experience designing and developing these complex solutions. As this is a relatively new technology this knowledge is invaluable if you wish to deploy such a system.

A passive solution capable of cooling the latest high performance processors.
Calyos uses a dielectric, safe, and green refrigerant inside our systems. This removes the risk of short circuiting expensive equipment if the lines are damaged.
Our systems are built for the latest components and can handle heat-flux hotspots up to 250W/cmÂ². Calyos is developing solutions to take this even further.
Combining standard components with custom lines to suit your mechanical design ensures our system can be adopted on both new or existing hardware.
With no moving parts, our solutions are extremely reliable and inherently maintenance free. Therefore they are ideal for reliability critical environments.
The beauty of two-phase is the ability to harness the latent heat of vaporization, using it to power the cooling system, making it the most sustainable solution.
Adapt the system to your needs
No application is the same, hence each of our solutions is adaptable to the your specific needs and design. Below we outline how several key parts of the solution can be modified to suit the thermal challenge you face. 
If you have multiple heat sources we can add extra evaporators as needed, combining them into one complete system. Calyos can also adapt the size of the mounting plate to suit the component socket or PCBÂ design.
The lines join the evaporator to the condenser. They can also integrate multiple evaporators in parallel if needed. Their route, direction, and length can easily be customised. Flexible sections are typically included to ease maintenance and installation.
Calyos can use any size of air exchanger, located anywhere within the server. Accessing remote locations can improve the performance thanks to better airflow. Calyos can also use a liquid to liquid exchanger at the back of the server chassis for heat recovery.
Our solution sheet includes on general specification, operating information, system materials and typical evaporators and condensers.
There are thousands of use cases for our technology. Here we have selected a few typical applications. Don't be afraid if you have something different - reach out to us and we can validate the application through feasibility study.
Here Calyos was targeting two 350W CPUs inside a 1U server chassis. The design was optimized for 75 CFM, ensuring quiet operation.
Here one 600W CPU, with >150W hotspots, is inside a 2U chassis with 300CFM of airflow. Transporting the heat to the rear of the chassis enabled maximum airflow.
Here a very low case temperature was targeted for a 300W FPGA in a 1U chassis by transporting the heat to an area where the air exchanger size and airflow can be maximized.
Calyos strives to meet the cost target for each application, whether it be through our own production or licensing the technology to a partner.

If you have multiple heat sources we can add extra evaporators as needed, combining them into one complete system. Calyos can also adapt the size of the mounting plate to suit the component socket or PCB design.
Parallel lines provide the liquid entry and vapour exit paths from the evaporators. Their route, direction, and length can easily be customized. Flexible sections are also included to ease maintenance and installation.
The liquid and vapour lines join a core loop using quick connectors. The core loop connects every sever in the rack together taking the heat to the condenser.
Calyos can use any type or size of condenser, be it air (including chillers), liquid, or a conductive plate, notably including recovering the heat for another application as outlined below.
Our solution is ideal for heat recovery. As we are vaporising the fluid, a two-phase solution like ours produces the highest temperature fluid possible. The higher the temperature of the fluid the better the ability to recover the heat. Combined with the fact that unlike single-phase active (pumped) cooling systems, LHP-DCR is pump-free, proving it is the most sustainable solution.
of data centers are air cooled
Air is an insulator. Air cooling inside data centers is inefficient and ineffective, proving the need for change.
of DC energy consumption is cooling
Switching to targeted, passive cooling can drastically reduce data center energy consumption.
Energy is wasted because power is spent cooling rooms and racks rather than the specific components that require cooling.
the opportunity of combined heat & compute
By combining a cooling system with heat recovery you are creating the most sustainable data center cooling solution. This is the clear direction for the future and combined heat and compute offers fantastic possibilities for recovering data center heat and reusing it for other, additional applications. Heat recovery is feasible both at small and large scales, aligning with the secondary application as required.
Waste heat from data centers could be used to heat high-density residential or community buildings. The heat collected from a data center can be used to pre-heat a hot water system.
Waste heat from data centers could be used to heat greenhouses to grow indoor crops, especially in cities. The heat collected can be used to pre-heat HVAC systems used in such environments.
Many water cooled solutions also offer heat recovery. But they require a huge consumption of water to do so. Our system is different using a green, safe, and dielectric refrigerant instead.
Calyos strives to meet the cost target for each application, whether it be through our own production or licensing the technology to a partner.
We are currently testing the solution in a variety of environments. If you would like to join our test program, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
Calyos is currently developing this rack level cooling system.
In the future we will further develop the solution for mass production.

A solution capable of cooling up to 800W, completely passively, using the conductive plate as a cold source. The design also operates in anti-gravity and has passed stringent military testing including dust, vibrations, accelerations, impact, and liquid ingress.
Using a 280mm radiator mounted above the evaporator this solution is capable of cooling a processor dissipating 300W. This is ideal for reliability critical applications due to the inherent fit and forget nature of an LHP-EE solution.
Implementing a Calyos solution enabled the use of the high-power LEDs totalling 300W. The exchange surface was reduced from 3.8mÂ² to 2.1mÂ² and the weight by 1.5kg. Notably the LHP-EE system was operating against gravity.
In this application a high MTBF was critical. Our solution delivered that, while also ensuring an IP66 rating with a 100% passive solution (no fans). The cooling of two 150W components was achieved with completely natural convection.
This portable solution was designed to improve the lifetime of the Peltier module it is cooling. It solved the mechanical challenge with a drastic reduction in the size and weight vs the previous solution. The design features flexible lines to ease installation and use.
