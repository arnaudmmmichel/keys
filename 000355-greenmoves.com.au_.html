What our clients say about our work
							Service is a word bandied about by most businesses but they don’t even know what it means. In a world where service & efficiency have almost dwindled away, there are still a few gems to be found. Danie King is one such gem & I am only too pleased to recommend her & excellent service & thoughtfulness. 						
							She filled me with confidence & I knew I was on the right track.						
							The knowledge, enthusiasm and commitment of Green Moves consultant Danielle has inspired me to a greater consciousness of the need for environmental sustainability and motivated me to act with greater consideration in respect of my surroundings and the use of natural means to maintain our everyday comfort. The benefit of her practical advice is reflected in my greatly reduced power and water usage, and knowing what and how to recycle items means my bin is never full – reducing ‘tip’ fill. 						
							I am now sharing the knowledge of environmentally friendly solutions and how to let natural resources work to your advantage with my neighbours.						
							We chose GreenMoves Australia to complete an Energy Efficiency Scorecard after considering a number of local suppliers. The booking and assessment process was simple and prompt. We enjoyed having Lucinda visit and complete the assessment. She engaged well, was very thorough, answered a lot of questions, and explained things extremely well. The report provided complete observations, advice, and general information. Despite being stunned by the positive outcome rating we will be undertaking the few recommended additional improvements.

Get guidance on where to begin
Any business or organisation can take steps to be Climate Active certified. Green Moves can work with you and your business to create the best pathway to getting certified.
Steps to becoming certified Climate Active Carbon Neutral
To be certified, you must meet the requirements of the Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard. This essentially means you must measure emissions, reduce them where possible, offset the remaining emissions then publicly report the results.
1. Enter and maintain the licence agreement
Apply for certification with Climate Active. Once your application’s been approved, your business can enter into a licence agreement with Climate Active.
Calculate your greenhouse gas emissions which establishes your carbon account or carbon footprint. This gives you a clear understanding of areas to focus on reducing your emissions.
3. Develop and implement an emissions reduction strategy
Now you can focus on reducing emissions wherever possible by making changes to your business operations. Ways of doing this include reducing electricity or buying it from renewable sources, reducing waste, improving fuel and transport efficiencies, limiting or avoiding travel, and using certified carbon-neutral products and services. As part of our service, Green Moves will create an emissions reduction strategy for you.
You can eliminate or offset any emissions remaining by purchasing carbon credits. A carbon credit is a reduction in emissions generated by a project such as reforestation or renewable energy. Businesses can buy these offsets to cancel out their emissions. When you have cancelled out all your emissions, you have reached a carbon-neutral state. While we don’t sell offsets at Green Moves, we will guide you through the selection and purchase process.
Get your carbon-neutral claim validated by an independent third party. Green Moves can guide you through this process. We’re entirely independent and can organise the data validation for your carbon account.
6. Publish a public summary of your carbon-neutral claim
Climate Active will assess all your reporting documents that support your carbon-neutral claim. When you receive certification, your public disclosure statement is published on the Climate Active website so everyone can see that your claims are credible.
As sustainability consulting experts, we’ve been working with businesses and government organisations since 2009. We’re continually working on improving and refining our services to your specific needs. We’ll give you all the help and guidance you need to get certified Carbon Neutral. You’ll find us easy to work with, with sustainability solutions that are practical and financially viable.
