A strategic plan and investor memorandum before approaching a blended finance/impact investment funders
A robust financial model and projection to inform an investor ask

A solid pitch deck to wrap the story up

Partnering with Impact Seed brings our collective deep local experience, knowledge, capability and networks to bear on project with the WA community at their heart.

Proven Impact Credentials and Client Satisfaction
Our team has led some of Western Australia’s key enterprise development, and impact management and outcomes planning projects.. We also understand the importance of impact communications to support our clients in connecting their stakeholders to the impact and outcomes they want to achieve. 
“It was a really great engagement [on developing an impact strategy] . Impact Seed listened to my needs, prepared an easy to read brief, were patient to my schedule and produced great, readily-applicable report”
“Without [Impact Seed market building], I’m not sure who else would have “owned” it. Yet, you’ve also deliberately created structures that try to ensure you aren’t always ‘at the centre’ of it, so it becomes dependent or too associated with you. In that way, you’ve changed the landscape and inspired many others to be active in it.”
“Impact Seed supported a group of diverse philanthropic beneficiaries to find common ground for the purpose of gathering data to demonstrate our collective contribution towards funding impact objectives. This process helped everyone refine their understanding of impact and made reporting to our funders much more meaningful.”
“Turning a grassroots movement into a sustainable organisation requires insight, understanding and big picture thinking. Sven from Impact Seed provided all these through his invaluable advice and support in establishing a strong foundation for the Plastic Free July Foundation. He asked pertinent questions, challenged our thinking and helped us to navigate our way through startup options to establish our new entity with clarity and purpose”
“Very good tailored with plenty of support offered…Impact Seed were collaborative, managed relationships with stakeholders very well, prioritised impact and were patient and prepared for meetings.
Communication – both in keeping the organisation updated on the status of the work and also in communicating with stakeholders. Some consultants are too ‘academic’ , but in our experience with Impact Seed, they have had the right balance.”
“[Impact Seed] has played a crucial role in ensuring the market isn’t compromised by opportunists and worked to create an inclusive environment that yields value based outputs. Without Impact Seed, the social enterprise and impact investing sector wouldn’t have anywhere near the profile it has now…”
“Kylie and Sven were a breath of fresh air when we first meet in 2016. They truly understand social entrepreneurship and its importance to a successful startup ecosystem. Over the past two years, Impact Seed has continually supported us,, connecting us with a number of like-minded people and investors who understand social enterprise business models. Following the 2017 Impact Seed pitch night, we raised over $250,000 in seed investment. All of this was possible thanks to support and guidance from Impact Seed.”

Impact Seed is catalysing systems-change in finance and business in Western Australia.. growing an impact economy where businesses support communities, environment and culture to thrive, sustainably.
As a proudly West Australian based advisory our focus is on place-based projects that aspire to create deep-impact here in WA, leveraging our state’s greatest strengths: natural and geographical advantages, resource rich public and private investment sectors, entrepreneurial and innovation talent, and deep traditional Aboriginal knowledge of how to care for Country on which we all depend.
We are committed to building trust-relationships with our clients and partners, grounded in two-way learning, authenticity, tailored and fit-for-purpose approaches to engaging with our clients, and leveraging our extensive networks to support the outcomes they want to achieve.

Impact Seed has brought together a team of experts across disciplines passionate about working towards a WA where businesses support people and communities to thrive. We embrace flexible and inclusive work arrangements.
Impact Seed was the culmination of a chance meeting between Co Founders Kylie Hansen and Sven Stenvers in 2012.
After a 15 year background in tech, telecommunications and clean energy startups, Sven exited his renewable energy venture in 2011, continuing to focus his passion for building impact-driven ventures. Kylie was then Chair and CEO of Cambodian/Australian social enterprise, Empowering Communities, having just returned to a Perth, and was concurrently working in roles across the WA NFP sector and completing her Graduate Certificate in Social Impact at UWA.
Over the next 2 years Sven and Kylie sought to further align their life and work with with their values, exploring the innovation landscape for investable WA social enterprises.
They found the WA startup, innovation and investment ecosystem in 2014 was overtly tech-centric and you were identified as 
“either a business, or a social enterprise, and not both”. 
Not satisfied with WA’s lack of support for social enterprise development, social innovation, and impact investment, Impact Seed was formed. Almost a decade later, it has grown to become a trusted partner for investors, corporates, not for profits and Traditional Owner groups across Western Australia.

  – How long has 2020 felt like? Maybe you craved less noise in your inbox in this overwhelming year? We get it..so welcome to our first update in some time.  In this edition we bring a trove of reading, as well as let you know about a few happenings: We welcome Liz Jack as our new Social Enterprise Manager for the Kimberley, and our partnership with Environs Kimberley; Our Great Southern workshop/dinner series in Denmark and Albany; the ImpactInsights Corporate Social Investment workshop, the Perth UN Global Goals Jam..all next week.  And finally member pre-registrations are now open for the WA Social Enterprise Council.  Join us and the many other great homegrown social enterprises in the representative sector body that is helping grow social enterprise across the state.
: State Government Carries Significant ‘Old Economy’ Risks into the Post COVID World: We may have done well on COVID cases, but going into the second half of 2020, close to the end of the current State Government’s four year term, we have now had a massive COVID economic impact; We’ve had climate impacts and fires; Destruction of cultural heritage and continued environmental degradation. All the while the economy has stagnated and is now going backwards with the highest rate of job losses in the country. Trying to get back to business as usual without investing in the transition to a new, inclusive economic model creates a substantial risk to the WA economy. To be clear, nothing should go back to normal.  Normal wasn’t working.
: The West Business – Impact Investment WA Alliance urges McGowan Government to support the emerging sector amid coronavirus crisis: Proponents of impact investment are calling on the State Government to support the emerging sector, saying a lack of leadership is hindering progress despite a huge appetite for investments that have positive environmental or social outcomes.
: Impact Investment in The West Australian; Launch of National Social Enterprise Alliance; And 2020 local, national and global updates on the market from the Yunus Centre, Responsible Investment Association of Australia, and the Global Impact Investment Network.

Resilience and Regeneration: Supporting social enterprise to support us
: Building WA’s Blended Finance Fund – A Perth Masterclass & Case Study Showcase; Impact Management for Corporate Social Responsibility & Organisational Impact – A Perth Masterclass; Supply Chain/Provenance Certification & Protecting Traditional Knowledge – A Broome Workshop; Now in its 3rd year this perennial sellout series on entrepreneurship is on again 23 April.  All proceeds of each event go to a WA social enterprise. And more!
 Reflecting on 2019.. and a focus for 2020. 2019 and the start to 2020 so far feels like an unbroken stream of bad news and catastrophe enveloping us in the form of climate-induced bushfires, ocean and land warming, species and habitat destruction; while extreme politics, and ‘alternative facts’ have dominated our news feeds on entirely unregulated social media platforms. It’s enough to make an eternal optimist question their world-view.
Having read so many thoughtful articles on these topics, one thread emerges – we can either sink into depression and inaction, or do something, anything, at a personal or professional level that can help contribute to solutions. And have gratitude for the good things in our lives, our families, our friends, our communities, a still stunning (if scarred) natural environment; and the blessings in our lives and our work. On that last note.. we bring you our first newsletter and a focus for the year ahead.
End of year 2019 News – Launch of Australia’s First Place-Based Impact Investment Fund in WA.
  We are excited for the launch of the first place-based fund of its kind in Australia, and thrilled for the opportunities it affords the development of a thriving impact investment and social enterprise market that supports positive social, cultural and economic impact for WA communities.  
Early in the new year we will be holding information sessions on the WA Impact Fund.  Funders, investors, advisors and entrepreneurs are encouraged to attend these sessions which will outline the investment mandate and potential opportunities for WA investors, funders and entrepreneurs.
