meta description:About us Mkt. Communications

We’re commercial raconteurs, telling insightful strategic stories that reflect the unique characteristics of a brand, based on simple truths and insights. Founded in 2006, we help brands evolve by working across key disciplines specialising in strategic Public Relations as well as assisting many clients across digital and social marketing, strategic planning, activation, events and direct marketing.
We work collaboratively with local and international brands to deliver outstanding work with tangible results. We are driven by insights and build strategic campaigns based on simple truths. We’re honest. We have courageous conversations with our clients and we sometimes tell them things they don’t want to hear, with great outcomes. We listen and we encourage our clients to listen as we believe that brands have ears too. Like all story tellers, we realise it’s in the delivery and without a compelling story, we’re out of business.

How We Work – Mkt. Communications
Our storytelling workshops are a journey of discovery, a purposeful search for brand meaning and context that inspires and informs our direction.
Stories are the pathway in. The door through which brands are able to spark our imaginations, trigger our emotions and invite us into a relationship.
Cultivating what we unearth, we extract the essence of a brand’s story and use both tangible and intangible elements to craft a tale that resonates.
The world is evolving and so too must our stories. Now more than ever, brands are required to articulate their purpose, bring their values to life and respond meaningfully to an evolving world where everything is being questioned.

Ministry of Work – Mkt. Communications
We work with organisations in different ways – it could be simply to engage people – communicating the great initiatives already underway, or deeper project engagements where we help managers and leaders create new culture building programs that will drive movement within the organisation.
Using our proprietary Five Movement framework, we move an organisation’s cultural dial using leadership education, physical and emotional health practices, workspace assessments and purpose and wellbeing initiatives. These are held together by a belief that change happens in the interactions between people, making communication the central tenet to our work.
We work with businesses big and small across various industries with a common desire – to create a different approach to organisational change (let’s call it movement, shall we?) and step into the future of work.
To read more about the work we do, visit the Ministry of Work website
