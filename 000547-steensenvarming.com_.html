meta title:About - Steensen Varming
meta description:N/A

Steensen Varming was founded by Niels Steensen and Jørgen Varming in Copenhagen – but the seeds of a global outlook were already sown when Jørgen and his architect father before him, studied in the U.K. Not long after the war ended, the Dublin office opened followed by Edinburgh and London – all preceded by prestigious commissions with competition-winning architects. The Sydney Opera House commission with Jørn Utzon continued this pattern and the Sydney practice opened in 1973. Hong Kong and New York followed in our eightieth year.
we are built on firm foundations
We strive for technical perfection. We are driven to enable the best building design where functionality and wellbeing are paramount. We demand at least as much from ourselves as our clients and collaborators have come to expect.
We grew up with the Danish design approach to refinement and longevity in our formative years. Since our foundation, in 1933, we have attracted and employed gifted people with a shared ethos and commitment to optimal design solutions. We focus on offering a portfolio of specialist services and high levels of expertise, deliberately maintaining a scale of operation that does not outgrow our talent pool. We continue to innovate to meet and exceed the needs of the most challenging projects, to consistently deliver positive outcomes.
But it’s not all about us. Our reputation, as one of the most respected and awarded building services consultancies, is built on the foundations of inspirational architects, brave clients – and our way of thinking.
“The engineer in his own way is an artist too – and not just a dead fish with a slide rule.”
We are proud to lead by example and consider environmental and social issues to be essential to a responsible business. We exclusively support projects that provide benefit to, and advance society rather than those that irresponsibly exploit others or the environment.

Celebrating 90 Years - Steensen Varming
This year marks a significant milestone as we celebrate 90 years of looking forward and implementing positive change. As we reflect on this occasion, we take great pride in tracing our organization’s rich history of important projects, events, and milestones since our foundation in 1933. 
As we reflect on our history, we are reminded of the countless individuals who have contributed to our success. Their dedication, expertise, and passion have been instrumental in shaping our organization and driving us towards excellence. We are immensely proud of our team and grateful for their invaluable contributions.
Before our foundation in 1933, Kristoffer Nyrop Varming (1865-1936), one of the Royal Danish Architects of the day, played a vital role in our establishment: Being worried that his son Jørgen would end up playing the cello in jazz clubs all his life, Kristoffer sent him to England to do an engineering degree.
Encouraging his son to become an engineer may be something he regretted, at least in a humorous way, seeing his poem entitled 1906 (being the year his son was born).
Vast changes have taken place since our foundation in 1933, but to appreciate how far we’ve come we want to look back at the history and philosophy which we were built upon and have since developed.
90 Years ago, in 1933, Steensen Varming was looking forward to working on our very first commission – the University of Copenhagen’s Library.
Shortly after our foundation, Steensen Varming started working with Niels Bohr to further develop the Niels Bohr Institute, as his fast-developing science required constant equipment and facility updates to his institute. Working with and for Niels Bohr had a significant impact on the company and resulted in precious know-how and many subsequent scientific research facilities commissions.
In the heart of Aarhus, Denmark, stands the Aarhus City Hall, a stunning masterpiece of functionalist architecture. The buildings striking design is the result of a fierce competition to secure the contract for its construction, won by the visionary architect Arne Jacobsen.
Jacobsen’s determination to win the bid was evident in his phone call to Jørgen Varming, where he demanded that Varming secure the vote of an engineer to the jury.
The Beginning of an International Expansion
After the end of World War II, there was a surge in construction projects across Europe, as nations sought to rebuild their infrastructure and economies. In this context, Steensen Varming secured the first engineering commission outside of Denmark, hired by Irish architect Michael Scott to work on a project that involved providing engineering services for the Irish National Bus Terminal and Headquarters for Irish National Transport Authority. The project was significant as it was Ireland’s first major building construction in the post-war period.
Steensen Varming was well underway with its international expansion in the 1950s, but smaller local projects were no less special to the company. One such project was Varming’s House, a heritage-listed, humble yellow brick house located just north of Copenhagen that is celebrated for its iconic architecture and innovative engineering. One of the most notable features of Varming’s House is its air heating system, which was a groundbreaking innovation at the time of its construction and has been preserved to this day.
Encouraged by architects such as Sir Basil Spence, in 1957 Steensen Varming’s international expansion continued with the establishment of a London practice. This marked the beginning of a new era of growth and expansion with the first project undertaken by the London practice being the redevelopment of the old St. Thomas’ Hospital, a project on a major scale.
Steensen Varming was responsible for the design, documentation, contract administration, and supervision of all engineering services related to the St. Thomas’ Hospital redevelopment.
In 1964, Steensen Varming joined friend and renowned architect Arne Jacobsen in designing the St Catherine’s College in Oxford, England, providing mechanical and electrical engineering services while ensuring our designs aligned with Jacobsen’s vision for the building.
One of our most significant contributions to the project was the design of an innovative heating system that used hot water piped through concrete floors to provide radiant heating throughout the building. This approach represented a significant departure from traditional heating systems and enabled greater energy efficiency while providing more even heating throughout the college.
A Landmark of Innovation and Artistry
Healthcare has always been an important focus of our work, today and in the past.
While our international expansion in the mid-60s was growing more rapidly than ever before, Steensen Varming always stayed well connected to the Danish roots.  In 1965, construction of Herlev Hospital commenced, a project that came to span over a decade. Steensen Varming played a pivotal role providing planning and briefing advice during the early stages with expertise extending to design documentation, contract administration and site supervision ensuring flawless execution of mechanical, hydraulic, fire protection, communication and control systems.
By the 1970s Steensen Varming had expanded beyond European borders as the Sydney Opera House brought the company to Australia, where we left a lasting impact on this iconic landmark. Collaborating closely with Danish architect Jorn Utzon, Steensen Varming pushed boundaries of engineering excellence and sustainability while staying committed to aesthetic integrity.
By utilising Sydney harbour’s plentiful water to provide cool air, we enabled the iconic silhouette to remain unit–free – a ground-breaking initiative on a world scale and at the largest system of its kind, making the Opera House a shining example of sustainable design.
The largest public building construction in the U.K. during the twentieth century
In 1973, the planning, design, and documentation phase of the architectural project for the New British library began. Steensen Varming took on the responsibility of providing engineering services for the 200.000 square metre building complex. This architectural masterpiece was meticulously crafted to consolidate the various components of the British Library, providing a centralized space capable of accommodating approximately 3500 readers, 2500 staff members, and a considerable number of visitors.
The primary objective behind this project was to create an environment which was specifically designed to safeguard and preserve the invaluable collection of 25 million volumes of books and documents, housed in the largest building in England.

meta description:N/A

Mechanical engineering design is more than componentry, it is the knowledge of the fundamental principles of physics and the ability to apply these imaginatively. Mechanical services are integral to the success of the internal environment of a building and essential for its people.
Through active and passive means, we adjust the perceived temperature and humidity. We ensure optimum levels of clean, fresh air. We keep data centres cool, operating theatres clean and recital halls quiet. In an emergency, our smoke extraction and life safety systems support safe evacuation. We deal with medical and industrial gases, developing bespoke, often award-winning, systems. We put as much into the design of our invisible plant rooms as we do the visible components of our integrated systems.
Technological advancement and statutory development make it critical to stay ahead, to use the best, or the next, available means. Sound engineering involves buildability, space, operation, aesthetics, acoustics, capital and recurring cost, energy efficiency and environmental quality. We consider the holistic requirements and priorities, applying mechanical engineering solutions that create comfortable buildings.

Modern society could not exist without the control and distribution of electrical power and communications. Electrical services are its arteries and veins – critical to the smooth operation of a contemporary building and its business. They are taken for granted, as long as they function properly, but their complexity is increasing at the same startling rate as technology is developing.
Electrical lifelines range from power generation, supply and infrastructure reticulation to communication networks, security systems, fire safety and vertical transportation. Their design and delivery requires patience and perseverance; liaison with supply authorities, strategic advice on cost and space planning, clear and concise briefings and precise documentation detailing every system powering the building, running the air conditioning, controlling the lighting.
Day-to-day operational provision converges with our long-term outlook where life-cycle cost, energy saving initiatives, efficiency, security and sustainability are key, including planning for interaction with embedded generation and smart grids. We are experienced in complex and challenging projects with a portfolio covering the health, education, defence, residential, commercial, cultural, public, civic and urban design sectors.
