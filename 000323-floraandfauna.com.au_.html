Kinder to Planet, People & Animals
Our relaunch date is getting closer!
You'll be able to get your hands on all of your favourite Flora & Fauna goodies very soon, and believe us... we can't wait until that day is here too!
In the meantime, want to know what's been happening behind the scenes?
Many of you know there's been some changes going on at F&F, and... Julie Mathers (our founder) is back!
Julie and HealthPost have teamed up to acquire Flora & Fauna.
They‚Äôre a family-owned, online natural health and wellness store who have been leading the way as an ethical retailer in New Zealand for the last 35 years. Just like us, they‚Äôre a B Corp business, purpose-led, and match our passion for finding products and brands that are kinder for you, animals, and our planet.
Flora & Fauna is back in caring and knowledgeable hands.
There are a few things you can do before we relaunch...
