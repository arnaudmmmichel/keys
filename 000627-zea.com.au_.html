A Story that Begins in Tasmania
The Zea seed was planted over ten years ago in our homeland Tasmania. 
Founder Hayden Brass and his parents Michelle and Simon were travelling throughout Tasmania and Australia to promote and sell their health and wellness products at markets and expos. 
During this time, they learnt about a mysterious Australian plant called Kunzea (kun-zee-ya) ambigua. Having not heard of it themselves, they began investigating the benefits of this native botanical and became truly inspired by its impressive therapeutic and aromatic properties.
Hayden saw the potential in this spectacular plant, and so decided to take a family project and turn it into a real business that could help people all over the world.
After several years of testing, promoting and learning about Australian Kunzea Oil, the Brass family eventually developed their own range of ethical Kunzea Products, and thus, a new company called Zea was born!
What followed was Zea Relief (short for Kunzea Relief), a natural personal care range that contains the naturally therapeutic benefits of pure Kunzea Oil. Zea has since extended its range to include three new sub-brands. The first is Zea Essentials, which is a range of 100% pure essential oils and aromatherapy products. The second is Zea Gourmet, which consists of delicious Australian Native Honeys, Bush Foods and Condiments. And most recently is Zea Active, which is for pre & post-workout muscle and body recovery.
