Carbon Neutral Energy From Waste Heat | Qpinch
          Carbon neutral steam at the lowest variable cost in industry. 
 Our patented QHT - Qpinch Heat Transformer - transforms waste heat into carbon neutral process heat, with no electricity consumption, providing the best financials within its technology category.
 Qpinch holds a selection of impressive awards and top-ranking accreditations. Thanks to these organisations for acknowledging our efforts. 
Qpinch enables large scale processing plants reduce their CO2 emissions and improve energy efficiency. Our fast implementation track with actual value creation, will also free up budget for long term energy substitution or carbon capturing projects. Double win! 
It’s elementary: converting waste heat into industrial process heat
Steam, hot liquid and vapours contain a lot of residual energy that is now released in the atmosphere – either directly or via cooling. The QHT can absorb waste heat down to 80 °C.
The captured low temperature waste heat is transformed into high temperature process heat, using a physicochemical reaction. No electricity is needed to drive the temperature lift.
We recover 50% of your residual heat and transform it into new process heat with temperatures of up to 210 °C. Our technology is applicable on megawatt scale.
Reduce carbon footprint while increasing operating margin.
          Qpinch accelerates your decarbonisation timeline with no impact on your operations and safety governance. Our safe and sustainable QHT technology is an add-on to existing infrastructure and outperforms competing heat lifting technologies in effectively reducing CO2 emissions at the lowest possible cost of ownership, in terms of value creation, OpEx and implementation timeline.
As your requirements increase, we can quickly scale up to +10MW installations by simply numbering up. We have a verified 15MW production but are confident that we can keep raising that bar.
Depending on the physical state of your waste heat, the Qpinch Heat Transformer achieves jumps from 80°C to 120°C and 120°C to 210°C. Those are 40° / 100°C lifts in one single step. 
A QHT installation requires only marginal energy consumption for its operation because no compressors are used. A mere 40kW of electrical input translates into one MW of steam.
Our QHT tech is an add-on that can be fitted to most process industry infrastructure. It can handle multiple operating conditions and is equipped to smoothly deal with heat fluctuations, both in duty and temperature.

            Improving refinery industry margins with waste heat recovery
The extensive refinery processing infrastructure is rich in opportunities for energy efficiency improvement. QHT tech reduces your OpEx to the point of actual value generation, which supports your other abatement investments.
We have highlighted some examples that are relevant to refinery process activities. 
It is clear that every plant has other essentials and priorities. We are keen to help you evaluate the potential of your particular infrastucture. Provide us with the specifics of your situation.
In the diesel hydrotreater stripper, light fractions are separated from the desulfurized product. The overhead of this stripper and the diesel product are currently condensed or air-cooled. In this stage a QHT installation can recover waste heat and transform it to process heat.
In this refinery unit, bottoms are further thermally cracked with steam into coke on one hand and lighter products on the other hand. The diﬀerent non-solid products are separated in the coker main fractionator column. The diﬀerent coolers and condensers present in the side cuts of this distillation column are valuable waste heat sources to apply the QHT technology. Concrete examples are: coker gasoil coolers and the main fractionator overhead condenser, containing mostly heavy naphtha. The QHT can turn the load of these coolers into CO2-neutral and quasi OEPX-free steam.”
Three waste heat streams are available for energy recovery in each FCC unit: main fractionator overhead condenser, light cycle oil cooler, slurry cooler. Any of these waste heats can be captured by a QHT installation and lifted to industry standard process heat. 
In this example, hot water is generated by recovering the latent heat from the main fractionator overhead stream and by cooling down a number of side streams such as the light cycle oil (LCO). Pay back times are calculated to be less than 4 years if the alternative is a natural gas boiler with natural gas priced at 50 €/MWh and CO2 at 80 €/ton

Steam crackers are designed to be highly energy efficient because they are large energy consumers. QHT tech can raise their efficiency even further. One of the largest European ethylene producers is investigating how Qpinch can help to recover waste heat from the oil quench. In addition, pyrolyisis gasoline aromatic extraction presents another attractive case.
It is common knowledge that para xylene extraction from reformate splitter bottoms is an extremely heat consuming technology. Despite the intense heat integration, there still is significant waste heat production. Recovering this waste heat and transforming it into valuable process heat, is calculated to have an IRR of >20 % 
In chemical productions, distillation is frequently used to recover the latent heat from the overhead stream. An Antwerp based partner, is operating a Qpinch chemical heat transformer to recover the waste heat from the overhead condensors and convert it to valuable process steam.
The QHT installation can improve the energy efficiency of your distillation columns by 50%. The bottom of distillation column is heated to process temperature for their operation. We are using the waste heat from the column overheads to reinfuse it in the heating process of the column bottom.

            Reducing the intense energy consumption of absorption systems
In the ongoing energy transition, carbon capture and sequestration allows for impactful reduction of CO2 emissions.
QHT integration in carbon capturing operations
The upcoming decade will be the decade of carbon capture and the massive deployment of operational applications. 
In accordance with your needs we can configure a centralized QHT system that perfectly fits your carbon capture plant. 
We achieve this by using the following building blocks.
Separate pure CO2 from other vapours by condensing inside the QHT unit and get OPEX-free and CO2-neutral steam in return.
The colder the gas stream, the more efficient the compressor and absorber. QHT can cool down the CO2-rich gas stream (if T > 150 °C) before entering the absorber and give OPEX-free and CO2-neutral steam in return.
The colder the lean solvent, the more efficient the absorber operates. The QHT unit can cool the lean solvent down to 80 °C before it enters the absorber and give OPEX-free and CO2-neutral steam in return.

Talk to our food & beverage specialist
QHT integration in food & beverage operations
We are currently exploring the practical application of the QHT technology in the food & beverage industries. If you are open to discuss possible opportunities in your industry, please get in touch.
In the food industry, steam is widely used for sterilisation purposes. Food processing plants are traditionally known as major consumers of energy for production. 
The most relevant processes for Qpinch technology in the industry are found in food processing. More specifically in the cooking, sterilising and blanching of edibles.
Waste heat from these installations is presently vented to the atmosphere, losing its untapped potential. By recovering this residual heat and transforming it to process steam, Qpinch technology is an enabler to reduce the CO2 foot print of the food industry. This links in with the growing shift towards energy efficiency as a supplemental strategy.

meta description:Qpinch technology opens a highly flexible range of new efficiency improvements for chemical recycling processes.



            Chemical recycling is a diverse sector with a vast scope for optimisation
Qpinch technology opens a highly flexible range of new efficiency improvements for chemical recycling processes.
We are actively looking to deepen our knowledge about the chemical recycling industry. If you are open to co-create with our engineers or to discuss potential cases, please let us know.
Pyrolysis of plastics is an energy-intensive route for closing the carbon loop. The thermal process of cracking requires large amounts of energy. 
Recovering the waste heat from the thermal process and using it instead to create more process heat represents an opportunity of significant value, especially in large-scale applications,
This energy is required to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium. Once the process heat is used, it turns to waste heat. Recovering the waste heat and turning that into valuable process heat is a valid way to make plastic recycling less energy intensive.
Pyrolysis is a thermochemical decomposition of organic material in the absence of oxygen. It involves the breakdown of organic materials at elevated temperatures in the presence of a catalyst into smaller molecules, yielding combustible gases and liquids that can be used as biofuels (natural gas), or feedstocks for chemical synthesis.
Why QHT tech is the solution to reduce waste heat in the chemical recycling industry.
Your OpEx suffers increasing pressures from highly volatile fossil fuel prices. Cut back on up to 50% of your fuel expenditures thanks to our QHT tech and decrease your dependency on market fluctuations.

Build your business case for using QHT technology
          We can present many powerful financial arguments for introducing QHT tech in your industry. Below you can find decisive data and clear information to support your case.
Defining the challenges for large scale processing industries
High energy prices are here to stay. The present shift is caused by fundamental geopolitical changes. Letting go of Russian gas means sourcing costly LNG from the world market.
The prices of carbon taxes are greatly affected by the energy pricing and the advancement of the energy transition in time. Scarcity in tradable emissions will push the prices up far beyond what they are now.
Aiming for Net Zero by 2050 calls for strategic planning of decisive abatement investments. In some industries this is a race for survival. The ‘Fit for 55’ milestone for 2030 puts the pressure on.
Volatile energy prices are here to stay
          Energy OpEx = Energy cost + CO2 cost
                Variable cost per ton of steam in Euro
Qpinch is a hedge toward energy and CO2 prices
There is no single overarching solution. We will need to combine them all. But more importantly, we need to act now. Implementing Energy Efficiency solutions as a first step will accelerate your progress and slingshot your budget. 
Using less energy to perform the same task or produce the same result is the quickest way forward. QHT technology pursues this goal by recovering and reusing otherwise expelled waste heat. 
Finding commercially viable and durable alternative feedstock is at the heart of the energy transition. Together, we have agreed to phase out all grey energy consumption in the future. 
Carbon Capturing and Sequestration, along with its reapplication (Utilisation) are necessary intermediate steps that will be relevant far beyond the 2050 milestone. 
A carbon offset is a reduction or removal of emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases made in order to compensate for emissions made elsewhere. Offsets are measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent.
Strategic options for Net Zero in industry by 2050
          Aside from carbon offsetting we discern 3 technologies that contribute to the emission abatement targets.
Annual energy cost per MW steam
          The long term value proposition has increased by a factor of 2.5. The potential savings on gas procurement and carbon taxation are increasing in line with the rising energy prices.
10x less electricity consumption compared to conventional heat pump technologies
Requires only a fraction of Scope 2 energy and technology sourcing
Requires only a fraction of the maintenance for it has no rotating components
The cheapest and most sustainable way to produce industrial stream
Strategic options for Net Zero in industry by 2050
          Aside from carbon offsetting we discern 3 technologies that contribute to the emission abatement targets.
The abatement cost curve in relation to QHT technology
The abatement cost curve identifies the different technologies to fully decarbonize a industrial site and at which cost, expressed in € per tonne CO2 abated per technology. Technologies with the lowest cost per tonne of CO2 are positioned on the far left side of the curve; the most expensive technologies are positioned on the right side of the curve.
The ideal placement on the matrix is on the far left and as close to the x-axis as possible, or even below it, if feasible. This specific position represents the CO2 emissions reduction in combination with the lowest investment cost. Technology that dips below the x-axis typically, or below current CO2 price (ETS or tax), results in cash generation and fast ROI.
 Industry consumes a quarter of all energy  
Contrary to public belief, the bulk of our energy is consumed while generating heat, not electricity. 
This is particularly true for process industries, where heat is pervasive in the processes that produce the feedstock for the industrial sector as well as finished products for the consumer market. Surprisingly, when we introduced Qpinch at McKinsey’s 2017 SRP Summit in Stockholm, some of the attendees were equally astonished to learn that the industrial energy mix is very much biased towards natural gas and other fuels – not electricity.
International Energy Agency Governing Board Chairman Noé van Hulst pointed out in his commentary to the release of the agency’s Energy Efficiency Market Report 2016 that “energy efficiency is [the] energy resource that all countries have in abundance.”

Some key numbers that indicate to which results QHT technology could lead you. But every project has different ranges and ambitions. We analyse and determine the unique potentials, based on your input. 
The bottom temperature at which the phosphoric acid inside the QHT can absorb waste heat.
Minimal temperature lift capacity between absorbed waste heat and produced carbon neutral process heat.
Your maximum OpEx of electricity is 4% of the delivered output, resulting in a COP of 25.
The maximum achievable process heat temperature, equivalent to CO2 neutral steam of 18 bar G.
The smallest standardised QHT unit has a nominal steam production of 0.5MW absorbing waste heat from hot water.
The biggest customised QHT unit designed and approved by our engineers to date, provides 15MW process heat production.

Convert your waste heat to process heat with Qpinch
The bulk of process heat in the Oil & Chemical industries lies between 120 and 220°C. Waste heat starts at 150°C all the
way down to ambient temperature. Roughly speaking, many plants have large amounts of waste heat at 120°C and below,
even after having exploited its potential to further raise the efficiency of their processes. 
Increase your energy efficiency reusing waste heat
Aside from the attractive financials, Qpinch offers solid operational benefits to help you reach your decarbonisation targets without taxing your functional continuity. Our QHT is innovative technology that can be efficiently integrated on any site. Find out more about the actual implementation process. 
A QHT installation is built with industry standard components and uses no rotating parts or compressors, making the installation highly efficient, with low-maintenance requirements.
All industries we serve have strict safety regulations, which our project teams are well equipped and trained to handle. QHT is safe and proven technology, with 14 years of R&D and without chemical consumption or use of expensive catalysts.
The QHT can cope with a wide range of heat fluctuations, both in duty and temperature, with limited need for operator intervention. The modular design allows for the combination of multiple heat sources and swift capacity expansion by numbering or scaling up. 
The combination of marginal electricity requirements and low-maintenance demands of the QHT installation, results in the most efficient process steam output per euro spent: 40kW of electricity per MW steam. 
          Nature’s energy converter! The highly efficient & reversible biochemical ATP-ADP reaction is used by all living cells.
