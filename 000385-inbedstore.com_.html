Warm gentle machine wash with like colours
Line dry where possible otherwise tumble dry on low setting (ensure you do not use a high/hot setting as this will damage the fibre)

Do not leave sheets on the clothesline or in direct sun for a prolonged period as natural fibres are susceptible to sun bleaching
Change your sheets regularly (we recommend every 1-2 weeks)
