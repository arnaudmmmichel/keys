Honey tells the story of its local landscape like nothing else â€“ from its color to its flavor, it allows us to experience our environment in a brand-new way.Â 
Whatâ€™s more, our revolutionary Flow technology lets you harvest in small batches directly to your jar, without the blending of conventional harvesting. The result? Each jar has its own unique taste profile, depending on which flowers the bees have foraged from. Youâ€™ll be amazed at the rich variety of colors, flavors and aromas a single hive can produce!
Introduce a beehive to your garden and experience the pollination power of up to 5 million flowers a day!Â 
Bees and other pollinators are a vital ingredient to ensure your plants bear fruit. They get busy, and (before too long) your abundant vege garden is the talk of the street.Â 
Whatâ€™s more, honey bees produce lots of delicious honey (up to 44 lb per Flow Hive, in fact!)
            Step 2: Learn as much as you can
One of the most important parts of becoming a beekeeper is learning as much as you can and we have you covered!
We have a swarm of resources available to help you every step of the way, including a weekly Q&A with the inventor, email, chat, and phone access to our support team.Â 
To fast-track your learning easily and enjoyably, we created an online beginner beekeeping course â€“ TheBeekeeper.org. Learn in your own time with high-quality videos explaining what you need to know in order to feel confident looking after your bees.
              Step 3: Source a bee colony to call your own
There are several different ways to 
source a colony for your hive
A popular option is to purchase a â€˜nucâ€™ â€“ a small colony which includes a laying queen, workers, drones and 4 or 5 frames of brood and honey.
Depending on your location, there may be late season swarms or splits available â€“ contact your local bee supplier or beekeeping club to check.
If they're all out, be first on the list for next season.
You may even find a local beekeeper who will share a late season hive split with you.
Jamie Oliver recently answered our most common questions by newbees. He purchased his first 
 in 2020, and has now expanded to 5 Flow Hives. He shared his wisdom to his social media followers.
Flow Hives are a fantastic hive for beginners. Theyâ€™re easy to use and make harvesting honey so much easier for the beekeeper and so much gentler on the bees.
Itâ€™s easy to get started but important to learn as much as you can. Check out online resources or connect with a local mentor to kick start your learning.
Yes! People keep bees all over the world, even in urban areas. Anywhere that bees can naturally survive, you can become a beekeeper.
Keeping bees is an absolute joy, so maybe work is the wrong word ðŸ˜‰ The amount of time required is minimal, but will vary a little depending on the season.
When selecting your garden blooms, make sure to include some local native plants in a variety of different colors.
Bees, like humans, enjoy diversity. Include flowers of different sizes and shapes and plant in clumps to make foraging a breeze.
Find plants that bloom at different times of the year. Support a range of different pollinators throughout the different seasons. Trees and shrubs produce much higher quantities of pollen and nectar, however, smaller plants produce forage more regularly â€“ itâ€™s great to have a selection of both.
Building a new home for your bees is an exciting part of your beekeeping journey. Itâ€™s best to take your time and ensure that you get your assembly right. 
Check out our assembly videos here
Itâ€™s important to treat the timber on your hive to give it the best weather protection possible for your climate, especially the roof â€“ itâ€™s the first line of defence against the weather. 
The good news is, you can keep a beehive almost anywhere! Especially a Flow Hive, as there is no need for additional processing equipment or for lugging heavy frames full of honey for harvesting. From rooftops to balconies to backyards, itâ€™s now possible to harvest honey directly from your hive.
Here are some tips to make sure your location of choice is good for you and for your bees.
An important part of getting your new hive up and running is ensuring that itâ€™s registered. This step is a 
crucial part of becoming a beekeeper
Part of beekeeping is ensuring youâ€™re informed about things that may impact not only your bees but the wider beekeeping community, such as biosecurity. The good news is there are a number of simple steps you can take to support the health of your bees when youâ€™re getting started.Â 
From staying abreast of any industry news, to registering your hive, to knowing what to look for in terms of pests and diseases, understanding these practices now will set you up for success moving forward!Â 
                  ^Start your free online beekeeping lessons ðŸŽ“
Join us at the Flow apiary livestream every Wednesday 10am AEST on Facebook or YouTube. You'll learn direct from the inventor on how to use a Flow Hive, and have the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered live. 
Furthermore, after your purchase, weâ€™ll email you an invite to our specially curated online beekeeping course with TheBeekeeper.org.
The course is designed to fast-track your learning easily and enjoyably.
Learn in your own time with high-quality videos explaining what you need to know in order to feel confident looking after your bees. Â

Bee suits are designed to be worn slightly baggy over your normal clothing, so itâ€™s best to choose a slightly larger size than you would normally wear.
Be sure to give yourself plenty of room to move around with additional length for movement â€“ ankles and wrists need to remain covered when youâ€™re crouching, bending or stretching.
You do not want the suit to be tight fitting â€“ itâ€™s this loose fitting material that offers sting prevention.

How does a bee suit work?
Beekeeping suits work by helping to prevent bees from being able to sting you. Thatâ€™s because the material in a heavy duty bee suit is too thick to allow a beeâ€™s stinger to pass through to reach your skin.
Your bee suit should be properly zippered closed, with all sleeves and trousers tucked into your gloves and footwear. This ensures there are no gaps for a curious little bee to  crawl inside your beekeeper suit. Itâ€™s also really important that the mesh in the bee veil doesnâ€™t rest against your skin.
How much is a bee suit?
Our beekeeper suits and protective equipment come in a range of prices, depending on which product best suits your needs. Check out the pricing for every option on the page above.
Itâ€™s essential to wear protective equipment when keeping bees â€“ from our ventilated mesh bee jacket with hood, to our organic cotton bee suits, youâ€™ll find the perfect protection for your needs and budget.
What is a beekeeping suit made of?
Our standard bee suits, as well as our toddlerâ€™s and childrenâ€™s bee suits, are made from organic cotton. Our 3-layer ventilated mesh beekeeping suits and ventilated bee jackets are made from a polyester blend with organic cotton.
All our suits come with goatskin beekeeping gloves to protect your hands.
What is the best bee suit?
We love all our bee suit options, but our 3-layer 
ventilated mesh suit is our premium bee suit
 and is the one we use the most here at the Flow office. The 3 intersecting layers of fabric create a patchwork that protects from stings while still allowing air to pass through the bee suit â€“ a great option for working in hot weather.
If youâ€™re looking for a vented bee jacket rather than a full suit (perhaps youâ€™re coming and going a lot in your apiary), then our lightweight 
 in ventilated mesh is a winner.
If you live in a cooler climate, our 
 are perfect for durability and comfort.
What size is a beekeeper suit?
You can get a beekeeping suit in whatever size you need. Our 
 is suitable for the smallest (and cutest) beekeepers. Our 
 comes in a range of sizes for children and teens, and we have 10 sizing options for our menâ€™s and womenâ€™s bee suits.
Your beekeeping suit should be large enough to work comfortably in and allow a non-restrictive range of motion. If youâ€™re not sure what bee suit size to select, check out our handy bee suit size guide on each product page to help you choose.
