Skin is ever-changing—it responds to environment, lifestyle and diet. Our range is designed with this in mind, catering to different preferences and needs to guide you towards optimal skin health.
For normal, dry or sensitive skin
Formulations to support most skin types or concerns
Neither oily, nor dry—perhaps better described as ‘balanced’.
Can be fragile, flaky, and dull in appearance resulting from a lack of sebum.
Often shiny in appearance with enlarged pores due to an over-supply of sebum.
Both oily and dry in nature, and susceptible to change and reactivity.
Naturally depleted with diminishing oil production and moisture retention.
Delicate and prone to aggravation and reactivity; can affect all skin types.
By identifying the characteristics of your skin, we can recommend products best suited to you.
A celebrated practice at Aesop, blending two or more formulations together can provide added nourishment or textural enjoyment, or offer compound benefits to skin from ingredients that work in tandem.
