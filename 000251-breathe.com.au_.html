Leading the way for sustainable architecture in Australia
 sustainable architecture and design firm, and its most dependable. Our 
 succeed because each one balances the unique needs of people and place.
 in Melbourne and Olinda, we passionately lead a transformation in building design with environmental, social and economic sustainability at the heart.
Good design starts with social value. Whether itâs a home, a hotel, an office or a retail outlet, we build places for people to thrive in.
Each project is perfectly adapted to its environment, and crafted to last. We build places that are robust and timeless, for this generation and those to come.
Every client has a budget, and expects a return on investment. We donât begin a project until weâre certain we can deliver on both.
After bushfires ravaged large parts of Australia in the summer of 2019/2020, Breathe felt compelled to act. Mobilising a long list of generous suppliers and services, Breathe rebuilt the home of Cobargo locals David and Barbara Rugendyke. The result is a story of generosity, resilience, community, and hope.

meta title:The Breathe Approach
meta description:Breathe focuses on maximising positive impact by providing architecture, creative and sustainability services to government, multi-residential, hospitality, commerical and private clients.

Breathe undertakes meaningful projects we can be proud of â those that align with 
Since we focus on maximising positive impact, many of our projects donât fit the common definition of âarchitectureâ. 
We work to understand who weâre designing for. We strive to inspire, engage and support our clients and the broader communities we serve. 
We prioritise social, environmental and economic sustainability in every project. We question the status quo to pursue outcomes that are informed by, and seek to better, those that came before. 
Above all, we prioritise ethics along with aesthetics, and design without ego, to create the best outcomes for our clients and their communities.
Breathe has a proven reputation for robust, elegant, and highly efficient architectural solutions for residential, commercial, and government clients. Our work responds deeply to communities, cultures, and their localities, and our projects are built with future generations in mind.
Not every problem needs an architectural solution. Our creative team solves problems holistically, with bespoke, needs-specific outputs: strategic documents that assess feasibility or are used to attract funding, temporary installations, or even a piece of furniture or lighting range.
Breathe works on sustainability strategy at precinct- and city-scale. We identify the barriers that stop governments and planners from finding sustainable solutions, then work to dismantle them. Often this involves brokering relationships â between power generators, energy retailers, embedded network operators and residents, for example. We also advocate for sustainability in government departments and within the architecture, property and construction industries.
You have an idea, or perhaps a problem to solve. Together, we write a project brief and define its scope. Then, we propose an approach to a solution that solves the problem within your budget.
The design phase is exactly what it says: a series of iterative, developing design activities that are progressively more detailed. The result? A design that responds specifically to the project scope.
Through delivery, we work closely with construction and technical experts on an ongoing basis. This way, there are no surprises as we meet each project delivery milestone on time and on budget.

meta title:Breatheâs Purpose
meta description:Breathe are change agents. We use design as a weapon for good and practice architecture in accordance with our values. Proudly a carbon-neutral business.

We use design as a weapon for good, and a tool to build a better future.
We design built environments from a holistic, sustainable perspective: each project reconciles ecological and social impacts within the current economic climate.
Breathe are change agents, advocating for the people in the cities where we live and work. We create spaces that are meaningful and accessible to everyone.
We approach our work with integrity, humility, equitability and transparency. We work to our established values and moral compass.
We push through complexity to understand the issues behind the problem. We work to understand the needs of our stakeholders, how they live and work, how they aspire to operate, and how we can make their lives better through design.
We never cease to question the status quo, create new systems, and overturn convention when convention isnât good enough. We study whatâs been done before and strive to do better. We inspire each other to broaden our positive impact.
We always see the forest first, then the trees. We work smarter, not harder, build more with less, and always stop to ask the question, âShould we build anything at all?â
We holistically evaluate environmental, cultural and financial sustainability in every task we undertake. We consider liveability, material life-cycle, carbon footprint and building performance to establish industry-leading projects.
We embrace honesty in ourselves and in our practice. Our designs expose structure and services, and use natural, raw, robust materials. We accept their heritage and sense of purpose and we celebrate their imperfections and individuality.
Breathe has a long history of positive impact on the built environment. In late 2022, Breathe became a certified B Corp and thereby joined a global community of purpose-led businesses who meet high standards of sustainability and social responsibility. This affirms Breatheâs position as a force for good in the creation of spaces where people and the planet can thrive.
B Corp Certification means that Breathe has been verified as meeting 
 for social and environmental impact. These high standards span across five areas: Governance, Workers, Community, Environment, and Customers. Breathe has made a legal commitment to stakeholder governance, and is demonstrating accountability and transparency by disclosing this record of performance in

Our office is powered by 100% renewable energy, and operates in a building with a photovoltaic array and energy storage. We also purchase carbon credits to offset our businessâ carbon footprint. Breathe targets zero waste, and offers composting and recycling facilities. All catering is vegan and cruelty-free.
In 2022, the total emissions offset is equivalent to...
27.32 laps around the Australian coastline
77.98 tonnes of coal avoided burning
Breathe are also committed to a reconciled, just and equitable Australia. We recognise the role we play in turning our intentions into clear actions through our

We're proud to have delivered a nationwide branch solution that sets a new benchmark for commercial fit-out design that isnât just about being carbon neutral in operations. ANZÂ Breathe offers a new approach to branch design that reduces its overall carbon footprint: its kit-based design contributes to a circular economy, with many parts of it being able to be reused and repurposed rather than tossed in landfill when a branch changes over time.

Four Pillars Gin: certified carbon neutral
Huge congratulations to Four Pillars Gin, the first gin distillery in Australia to achieve carbon-neutral status via Climate Active, one of the most stringent carbon-neutral programs worldwide.
From day one, sustainability has been at the heart of Four Pillars Ginâs production and business and itâs been an absolute pleasure working with their team on the creation of Distillery 2.0. The new distillery incorporates new sustainable outcomes, such as saving 29 tonnes of glass per year on-site by piping gin directly from the distillery to the beautiful new bar. And that's just the beginning.
We can't wait to share more detail about this project when the new distillery opens â soon!

âIt was an honour to be involved in the Interior Design Excellence Awards as the inaugural sustainability judge. Recognising the twin crisis of climate change and biodiversity loss â the sustainability award is future focused and a great opportunity to spotlight impactful ideas that might inspire or shift direction to elevate the built environment. The field of 22 shortlisted projects across most categories were assessed against brief, performance, materials, innovation and performance with special attention given to projects that are fossil fuel free, consider material lifecycle, human, cultural and environmental health. At very different scales, each of the awarded projects demonstrated industry leadership for their aspirational carbon reduction initiatives and powerful connections to the natural environment. They are optimistic, elegant, innovative, inspiring and future focused. Congratulations to all the winners.â â Bonnie Herring, Director of Architecture at Breathe and IDEAâs 2021 Sustainability Judge.â 
Ona Coffee Melbourne â IDEA Awards Winner
, winner of the Editorâs Medal at the 2021 Interior Design Excellence Awards (IDEA)! â 
âThe decision for this yearâs Editorâs Medal was not made on aesthetics alone. For me, 2021 was a year of retrospection. Like a lot of Melburnians, there was plenty of time for reflection on where Australian design stands and where it should be headed if we are to truly be responsible and ethical practitioners. Beauty for beautyâs sake and ostentation at the abandon of everything else are not the only things that should drive us. Which brings me to Breathe.â 
One of Australiaâs first hospitality projects to be completely carbon neutral in operations, Ona is exceptional. The Canberra-based roaster makes its Melbourne debut in an understated Brunswick warehouse conversion that is as inviting, humble and personal as it is beautiful, touching lightly on its site with raw and recycled materials and a multilevel amphitheatre that, in time, will run wild with greenery.â
We spent a great day on site at the soon-to-be-completed Four Pillars Distillery 2.0 in Healesville. It was such a wonderful taste of whatâs to come. We enjoyed the gin masterclass with Cameron Mackenzie and Stu Gregor, gin snacks by Matt Wilkinson, and a tour of the sparkling new spaces with Breathe Project Lead, Camilla Carmichael. We canât wait for the official opening! â

The Cogarbo Santa Project in Green Magazine #83
, a home we created for the Rugendyke family after their home was destroyed in the black summer bushfires. We provided pro-bono architectural services for the project and engaged with suppliers and collaborators to provide pro-bono material and appliances for the project. Among the many things donated were kitchen and laundry appliances, solar panels, solar installation, heat pump, heating and hot water plant and equipment, lighting, carpet, paint and insulation. â 
Living in temporary structures with their foster children since the fires, we worked very hard to make sure that the Rugendyke family were out of home for as brief a period as possible. At Christmas 2019 their house burned down. At Christmas 2020, they were celebrating in their new home â with their family.â â

Aboriginal Housing Victoria (AHV), a community-led organisation managing over 1,500 rental properties for Aboriginal and Torres Strait people in Victoria, embodies the strength and resilience of First Nations People. This strength exists despite inadequate access to affordable and appropriate housing. An issue which is complex and multi-faceted, rooted in dispossession and dislocation and one that requires action beyond architectural intervention alone. First Nations Peoples are disproportionately impacted by: housing market failure; family violence and breakdown; institutionalisation; poverty of household material resources; and a lack of culturally appropriate mainstream housing services. â â 
Recognising the need to significantly increase the amount of their available housing stock, AHV engaged Breathe to design their first multi-residential social housing project. AHV has been a strong guide throughout this process, providing clear direction on culturally appropriate design. â â

The recent bushfires devastated so many communities, but none more so than Cobargo. We all remember the images of the exhausted firefighter not wanting to shake hands with our Prime Minister; we all remember the Prime Minister asking âWas it because he was tired?â and being told, âNo, itâs because his house has just burnt to the groundâ.
We at Breathe, like every other Australian who lived through the horrific 2019/2020 summer, wanted to do what we could to help those brave RFS firefighters who had lost their own homes defending other peopleâs homes and lives. To that end, we embarked on the Cobargo Santa Project. 
Breathe provided pro-bono Architectural services to the brave RFS firefighter Dave and his wife Barbara. Throughout their lives, the couple have fostered over 400 children. They are kind, giving and generous people. Not only did they lose their home in the fire, they also lost their shed containing Daveâs Santa sleigh:Â Dave, with a beard to match, is also the Cobargo town Santa, bringing joy to the children in their community every year on Christmas.
A GoFundMe campaign funded the rebuilding of Daveâs shed and sleigh. But what Dave and Barbara needed most was a new home.
Breathe engaged with suppliers and collaborators to provide pro-bono material and appliances for the project. Among the many things donated were kitchen and laundry appliances, solar panels, solar installation, heat pump, heating and hot water plant and equipment, lighting, carpet, paint and insulation.

Lastly, we would like to thank the brilliant local community for supporting Theodoreâs through the good times and the hard times, for having your buildings painted to create an immersive place and importantly, for coming together on a hot summers day to paint the street, to claim it back for everybody.

Noting a need for public, open green space and relief from the relentless built form, Breathe worked closely with residents from The Commons and Nightingale 1 to successfully petition Moreland City Council for the construction of a âpocket parkâ at the end of Florence Street in Brunswick.
The pocket park provides a pooch and pedestrian friendly space for residents and visitors of the Florence Street cul-de-sac to gather, engage and enjoy the treats on offer at nearby 
Our ultimate goal is to have a series of pocket parks installed in the Moreland municipality, enhancing the sense of community in the neighbourhood.
The Upfield Shared Path is one of the most used car-free spaces in Moreland, and yet much of it is a waste land. More than ever Melbourne needs cool, shady, beautiful spaces that encourage bike use and walking, while simultaneously storing water, carbon and increasing biodiversity. Ordinary people within our community are working on this transformation and have formed the 
. Breathe are proud supporters of this community group and we help out wherever we can.
The Upfield Urban Forest groupâs mission is to transform the Upfield shared path and greens spaces either side of the train-line into a safe, beautiful urban forest. A place where users can experience tranquility, shade, inspiration and connectedness. Come and join the transformation.
Master of Architecture Design Thesis students at University of Melbourne are offered a selection of studio options each semester, including Nightingale Night School. The School is led by Jeremy McLeod, Managing Director of Nightingale Housing and Founding Director of Breathe, as well as members of the Breathe and Nightingale Housing teams.
The currently accepted multi-residential development model is aimed at delivering buildings with maximum financial yields. It places no focus on the people who will live in the building, or the impacts it will have on the environment and local communities.Â 
The Nightingale Night School gives students the opportunity to learn in depth the Nightingale Housing process of delivering carbon neutral, triple-bottom-line housing at cost. It lets them push the boundaries of multi-residential architectural design to create meaningful contributions to the city, and exceptional spaces for people to live in.
Students are taught how to run financial feasibility studies on project sites. They gain unique insights into the interaction between architectural design and other disciplines involved in the procurement process, such as development managers, financiers and community housing providers. They are given the tools to undertake a Nightingale project and use these to design, in detail, a medium-density apartment building on a real site in Melbourne â a prototype of their vision for the future of urban housing in our city.

meta description:Join Breatheâs crew of change agents as we transform built environments into sustainable places to live, work and thrive. Work with like minds, in a place where you matter.

Breathe is a Melbourne-based design studio. We create and contribute to world-class built environments that have an enduring, meaningful impact on communities and the planet.
Breathe transforms built environments into sustainable places to live, work, and thrive. 
We work across a range of typologies and building types, from 
 projects to alterations, additions and interior fitouts. We focus on achieving the greatest positive impact in everything we do, so some of our work isnât form-based at all. 
Our goals mean our work is a marathon, not a sprint. Weâre in this for the long haul: for our own future, and the future of generations to come.
The Breathe crew are change agents: environmentalists, humanitarians, urbanists and activists. We hold ourselves personally accountable for our work, and we genuinely value its outcomes, so we always push that extra mile to innovate and problem solve beyond conventional approaches. We recognise humanity, value individuality, and work on the understanding that we are always stronger together.
Diversity is an integral part of our history, culture and identity. Inclusion is the way we treat and perceive all differences. We want to create an inclusive culture where all forms of diversity are seen as real value for Breathe, our clients and the communities we serve.
Breatheâs family policy is reflective of our core values, bringing together aspects of financial and social support with environmental considerations. We want our staff to feel supported to take time away from work for the birth or adoption of a child and be encouraged and empowered to return to work on their own terms, in whatever way is right for them and their family.
We value our team members as real people who have personal obligations as well as professional ambitions.
We happily support our staff to work flexibly when needed.
We are committed to an inclusive environment where each individual feels safe, heard and comfortable to bring their authentic selves to work.
Our core work hours are between 9am and 5.30pm, with a 37.5 hour full-time work week.
We run monthly in-house CPD sessions on a broad range of topics, and offer Archicad training sessions as needed.
Our annual productivity reviews ensure you have the tools and support you need to do your best work.
We offer on-demand ergonomic assessment of your workstation.
An allowance for items to support the physical and mental health of our employees, such as gym memberships, mental health appointments and more.
The single biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions is from energy for building operations. We work with our staff to help them ensure theyâre getting 100% accredited GreenPower to their homes and we make a financial contribution to ensure staff are supported to do this.
We walk the walk (literally). Carbon emissions related to transport are the third biggest contributor to climate change. We support our staff and incentivise them to use sustainable modes of transport with an allowance for their Myki and bicycle repairs.
We collaborate with other leading architecture firms to help partner our future leaders with leaders of today.
If you ride, weâll cover your insurance. Your health and safety is important to us.
