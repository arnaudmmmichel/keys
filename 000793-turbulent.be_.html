meta description:Turbulent's micro hydropower plants are providing environmentally-friendly, renewable energy around the world.

Use tab to navigate through the menu items.
Democratic Republic of the Congo - 30 kW
Vale das Lobas, Portugal - 5 kW
This project is the first micro-hydro power plant to be installed in a natural river in Taiwan. It will generate a total of 100 kilowatts of continuous power from separate core units installed in the Annong river, one of the most scenic rivers in Yilan County, Taiwan. The energy will be injected into the grid, generating a new revenue stream for SJS Development. The company is also aiming for a joint cooperation with other local businesses to create the first community-made micro-hydro power plant.
Stretching over 17.2 km, the Annong river is formed by the tailwater of the Langyan Power plant and it fertilizes more than 50 km2 of farmlands. The river is also used for whitewater rafting, which is, most of the time, an excellent signal of the suitability of the stream for Turbulent turbines.
For comparison: by installing the Turbulent technology, the emission of 744 tons of CO2 per year will be avoided. Coming soon!
First 100 kW turbine operational in 2022.
100 kW turbine: Nominal flow of 5.8 m3/s and net head of 3.3m
4 years to break even (100 kW turbine)
Reduction of 744 tons of CO2-eq / yr (100 kW turbine only)
Turbulent has received a grant from the Belgian government to develop and install turbines generating 140 kW of continuous energy for 3000 people living in a remote village in Mindanao, Philippines. The village has currently a very unstable connection to the electrical grid, often suffering from blackouts.
For the Grandline Innovation Company in Thailand, Turbulent is developing a new 50kW Vortex Turbine. The generated energy will mainly serve to generate profit for the company by being sold to the grid. 
Turbulent has been working together with a private customer to develop a 30kW off-grid vortex turbine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The energy generated will be used to replace the diesel generators previously used for the farming activities, and turn to green, renewable energy reducing over 220 tons of CO2 each year.
Democratic Republic of the Congo - 30 kW
For eco-tourism purposes in a remote location in the impressive landscapes of Patagonia, Chile, Turbulent is in the process of developing a 15kW off-grid Turbine to generate renewable energy all-year long. By installing one of our turbines, the site will receive continuous power without having to rely on fossil fuels, or having to put up with the limitations of intermittent energy sources.
Turbulent has been undertaking its first installation in Denver, UK. This turbine will generate 7.5 kW of renewable energy to charge the electric vehicles and utilities of the client, which is the environment agency of the United Kingdom.
Moreover, the turbine will be used to perform fish-friendliness tests with live fish. This project is due to see the light in 2022.
Vale das Lobas, Portugal - 5 kW
The turbine provides electricity to the Carré de Réunion, a chemical-free wastewater treatment plant in Versailles, France. Since 2017, it is the largest membrane treatment unit in Europe; a mix of green innovation beautifully blending into the classified plain of the Palace of Versailles. ​
Estimated energy consumption for 8.5 households 
Canal with a nominal flow of 0,7 m3/s. and net head of 3.2 m.
The turbine supplies reliable energy to the 
, the world-famous sustainable school located next to the Ayung river in Bali, Indonesia. Our 13 kilowatts vortex Turbine benefits more than seven hundred students, teachers and staff.
The turbine was inserted into a pre-existing concrete basin. It was custom-designed to spin in a counterclockwise direction. In addition, the installation does not produce noise pollution: it is very quiet, with minimal squeaking and vibration.
Finally, they will earn their investment back within four years. Turbulent is currently engaging in distributor and development partnerships within the ASEAN region.
1.57m3/s and vortex water height of 1.85m
Stainless blades allow stones and other debris up to 10cm in diameter to pass
This 5.5 kW vortex turbine provides reliable, off-grid electricity for a private house in Otepää, a small town situated in the southern Estonian hills and valleys.
The house is in the middle of beautiful natural landscapes and due to its remote location, our customer had to use a diesel generator in lack of better alternatives. 
Fortunately, they had a river passing nearby and discovered the Turbulent vortex turbine. When our customer saw our viral video, he felt so inspired he started to build the civil works himself before even contacting the Turbulent team. 
Our vortex turbine will save them 17 tons of CO2 per year.
0.75 m3/s and vortex water height of 1.6 m
Casted blades allow stones and other debris up to 10cm in diameter to pass
The turbine in Donihue has been active since January 9, 2018, and in full operational mode since March 2018. It provides renewable energy for a local avicultural farm, and was built by local Chilean craftsmen with the help of our engineers.
Basin made out of reinforced concrete (2 weeks)*
Core components installed in 2 days after delivery to site
Flow of 1.65 m3/s and a head of 1.7m
Able to pass sand, and stone debris up to 10cm in diameter
This turbine will generate clean and reliable electricity to power a restaurant in Vale das Lobas Nature & Health Sanctuary, in the heart of rural Portugal. Lager da Ribeira, an ancient granite olive mill, is being transformed into an amazing riverside restaurant. The turbine will be located underneath a glass floor, creating an astonishing view for visitors and locals interested in learning more about the power of micro-hydropower and sustainability.

A slow RPM impeller with a design that creates low shear stress. The slow rate of pressure difference over the blade ensures that this turbine lets all fish and aquatic life pass by unharmed. 
At Turbulent, our work doesn't stop at the energy output. We work with our clients to ensure a smart usage of the energy and the grid. This can be done by optimising the load, for example by powering heavy users during the night, and coupling alternative energy sources during peak hours. 
When developing a site, we also study the regional situation. Of course, our turbines are flood proof, but we can also include ways to prevent flooding in the area in our civil works design.
Turbulent wants to empower local communities by transferring knowledge to the people. This is a win-win situation where workers gain experience in installing hydro, and support is readily-available in the region. 
Turbulent micro-hydropower plants successfully address all the challenges other renewable energies are facing: energy security, low capacity factors, big land areas, and last but not least the unpredictability caused by weather and day-night cycle.
