Why your people are not your greatest assets
A common catch-cry of organisations, and their leaders, is that ‘people are our greatest assets’. However, people can’t do their best work if we treat them like machines. 
Leadership is a human pursuit and effective leadership requires us to take a human approach. 
This keynote will get your audience thinking, challenge their perspectives and re-energise their work.

Re-energise your team and re-imagine the way you work.
If you and your team are feeling depleted, it’s time to re-energise!
Energy can neither be created nor destroyed - it can only be transformed.
Accessing our untapped potential energy starts with how we think and behave. 
This series of five workshops is for teams who are ready to re-energise, to access their full capacity and to power-up their performance.
From Human Assets to Human Beings
Challenge assumptions to re-humanise your workplace and re-energise your work.
LEARN how assumptions about people can hold us back.
EXPLORE how re-humanising work starts with our language.
DISCOVER new ways to support people to do their best work.
Elevate your expectations to create a thriving & resilient environment.
LEARN why a resource based approach undermines people’s capacity to do their best work.
EXPLORE how the environment we creates impacts how people show up.
DISCOVER how you can shift the focus for a more sustainable future.
Harness your human creativity to innovate for sustainable growth
LEARN how what we measure can underestimate our true capacity.
EXPLORE which skills are the most essential to develop.
DISCOVER how you can harness the creativity of your people to boost performance. 
Go beyond collaboration to grow together as a community.
LEARN how what we grow impacts on our identity.
EXPLORE how a focus on shared outcomes can help grow community.
DISCOVER how to support your people to work to their full capacity.
Reimagine engagement to reduce effort & energise your teams. 
LEARN how power differentials can restrict growth and limit performance.
EXPLORE how to reduce effort by removing barriers to energy flow.
DISCOVER how to empower your people to their best possible performance.
These half-day workshops can be delivered in-person or online either as stand-alone workshops, or as a series of five. 
The series can be delivered in a periodic sequence, or as an integrated three day off-site.
Why your people are not your greatest assets
A common catch-cry of many organisations is that ‘people are our greatest assets’. However, as leaders it’s essential that we don’t treat our people like machines, or as mere economic artefacts. 
The technical approach and the business perspective are necessary, but not sufficient. Machines are expendable, but people are not. People do their best work when they are valued, respected and seen.
In this paper,  Dr Monique Beedles explores the reasons why we should not refer to our people as assets and how, instead, we can develop our essential leadership capabilities.
