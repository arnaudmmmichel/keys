Thanks so much for your email, it is much appreciated. In fact I thought I should frame it – don’t think I’ve ever received an email advising me that 50% of an agreed invoice amount is being voluntarily deducted as an act of support for the work that NGOs do!
However, I can also say that that is great news, thank you.
Our 2 new school based trainees have started and are progressing well, along with our adult trainee, who has won the hearts of all she works with.
Many thanks for your ongoing support.
Since June 2013, Alison Sentance has been working in partnership with Life Without Barriers to assist them in building their local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workforce across its business in South Australia. To do this Alison proposed building the workforce through a tailored training and employment strategy. This strategy commenced in September 2013 and Alison is continuing her work with the business to ensure successful implementation. A challenge for all not-for-profit organisations is finding funding for new strategies which are not allocated within funded contracts. Alison was able to demonstrate her knowledge and expertise in sourcing funds and through strategic partnering was able to implement the strategy for the business at minimal cost.
Vital Consult strongly believes that sustainable businesses are built through investing in their people. Working with Ngarliyarndu Bindirri since July 2013, Alison has spent the last 6 months mentoring and supporting the business leaders to take the next step in their career progressions. To do this successfully it has required the support and expertise of an experienced business mentor working at both the executive and operational levels. As a mentor Alison works to address areas of identified need, she helps build the capacity of the individual but at the same time takes a holistic approach to supporting the business to ensure it has a clear understanding of what guidance, resources and infrastructure is required to invest successfully in the next generation of leaders and support staff.
Change management is usually associated with larger commercial corporations, whereas not-for-profits are typically left high and dry when funding dries up or the business environment dramatically changes. This is generally the result of limited capacity within the business to understand possible change strategies and organisational change requirements to stay current and effective within a variable business environment. Vital Consult has worked with various not-for-profits assessing their need for change to ensure its business is able to adapt to current and future market needs. This has created new income streams, often in line with the current business vision, but in some cases businesses have required complete corporate change strategies. Alison has been able to successfully address these needs, helping to guide strategy and implementation.
​Giving back and helping charities and not-for-profit organisations with a social and environmental focus is important to us at Vital Consult.
From the 1st of July 2014, Vital Consult will be contributing 20% of its profits to charitable organisations aligned with its values as part of its Corporate Social Responsibility initiative. As a business engaging Vital Consult, you will receive a summary of its financial contributions so you can see firsthand what your investment is achieving.

Vital Consult is a founding member of B Corporation Australia
Vital Consult is thrilled and very proud to be one of the founding members of B Corp Australia, and the first in South Australia. This is the beginning of something big, a vibrant community of socially responsible businesses, working together to lead the way in terms of sound corporate social responsibility, with the ultimate aim being to make Australia a better place for all.
By voluntarily meeting higher standards of transparency, accountability, and performance, Certified B Corps are distinguishing themselves in a cluttered marketplace by offering a positive vision of a better way to do business. Today, there is a growing community of more than 1,000 Certified B Corps from 33 countries and over 60 industries working together toward 1 unifying goal: to redefine success in business.
Government and the not-for-profit sector are necessary but insufficient to address society's greatest challenges. Business, the most powerful man-made force on the planet, must create value for society, not just shareholders. Systemic challenges require systemic solutions and the B Corp movement offers a concrete, market-based and scalable solution.
From the very beginning Vital Consult and its managing director, Alison Sentance, has seen the need for business to be focussed on more than just the bottom line. Business can and should drive positive social and environmental changes. One simple example of this that Vital Consult has undertaken in recent months is to look to utilise the banking services of a bank that doesn't support and therefore perpetuate the fossil fuel industry. As a certified B Corp, Vital Consult has undergone a thorough impact assessment and proven its commitment to supporting positive social and environmental change.
B Corporations compete not just to be the best in the world, but to be the best for the world. As a B corporation, we are now part of an inspiring global community of ethical and socially responsible businesses that seek a better way to do business. As a consumer or a service user, the B Corp certification makes it easy to support businesses that in turn support their communities to be better.
If your business is considering becoming B Certified but doesn't know where to start, Vital Consult has the tools and experience necessary to guide you through the process. As the B Corp community grows here in Australia so will an important voice, the voice of the consumer to say: "I want to support businesses that can demonstrate they are having a positive impact on society and the environment." This represents a fundamental shift away from the often damaging focus on profit at all costs.
