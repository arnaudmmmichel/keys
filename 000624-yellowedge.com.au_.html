The Wayfinder explores the often winding paths of how these Fellows came to their professions and catalogs the trials and tribulations faced along the way.  
Episode 6: Tim MclEnnan & the Transformative World of Assistive Technologies
“[L]ike most people who have experienced catastrophic injuries, it's a major point in your life— everything changes.
All your assumptions get thrown out the window of what tomorrow's going to be like. But there does seem to be a sort of a major pivotal role when people experience these of either overloaded and really struggled with life from that point, or it becomes such a driving force for motivation and an ability to see new potentials and options.
In this episode, Scarlet speaks with Tim McLennan, a Churchill Fellow and clinical rehabilitation engineer based at Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth, Western Australia. Tim's journey into the world of assistive technology was profoundly influenced by a life-altering experience. Tim's story is one of personal transformation and a deep commitment to making a difference in the lives of those who have faced adversity. He specialises in innovative assistive technology, a field that aims to enhance the independence and quality of life for individuals with disabilities.
Tim provides valuable insights into the world of assistive technology, explaining its significance and showcasing its far-reaching impact. He dispels misconceptions, discussing the diverse range of assistive devices beyond the well-known examples like wheelchairs and prosthetics.

I think that the way forward is through partnerships. It's not rocket science. It is really about various agencies coming together for shared common cause.

S01EP03: Alpha Cheng & Changing the Headline
I started… to think maybe I can also use my story on my own terms to spread positive messages and speak out against hate, and potentially prevent or reduce the risk of similar things happening again. ”
In this episode Scarlet speaks with Churchill Fellow Alpha Cheng about how he found his voice for advocacy after the sudden and violent loss of his father. Alpha’s father Curtis Cheng was killed in a terrorist attack in 2015. Alpha shares with us how he chooses to messages of hope over hate, full in the knowledge that his, and stories like his, have the power to change communities and policies. 
Drawing from his experiences abroad in UK, Norway, Denmark, France and Israel, Alpha aims to promote harmony, unity, hope, as a way of speaking out against prejudice and hate. Through this stance Alpha has been able to use his voice to promote change for issues such as gun laws, xenophobia and multicultural diversity.

“We want to help people tell their story.” 
Meet Julie Morrison who, alongside dogs Lucy and Kiki support victims of crimes in Victoria through the Office of Public Prosecutions.
Julie, who had worked with support dogs in both hospitals and schools, thought, why not in the justice system? Though similar programs exist in other countries, such as the United States and Canada, there was nothing in Australia. Julie changed this. 
Overcoming roadblocks and challenges along the way, Julie now runs the ‘Court Dog’ program through the OPP. They play a powerful role assisting victims through deeply challenging moments, and supporting justice procedures. Julie is currently looking to expand the program both in terms of the amount of services they can provide (as dogs!) as well as into other jurisdictions across Australia. 
Learn about Julie’s story and the wonderful work she does in this first episode of The Wayfinder Podcast.

WHY IS OUR POTENTIAL SO IMPORTANT?
Potential is hope and hope is an innate human survival trait – without which we perish.
People within our families, communities, workplaces, social and professional circles who identify, nurture and encourage the potential they see in others are themselves an important form of social and community capital. Their actions in spotting and unleashing the potential in others represent a kind of active investment in the future.
In our largest State of Human Potential survey to date, we set out to better understand the state of human potential in the ACT and across Australia, how much people have been able to realise their potential and what might have enhanced or impeded this.
We define potential as “the capacity to develop and fulfill our ability to be the best version of ourselves to lead happy and fulfilled lives.”
The survey has led us to wonder; what if we are able to tap into what is truly meaningful, authentic, and fulfilling in our lives and to be able to make conscious decisions to pursue and develop this?
What if we could fully tap into our latent individual and collective potential? How might we be able to not only live happy and fulfilled lives, but also to also cultivate hope, agency, and capacity to tackle our world’s greatest challenges?
Charles M. Schulz was once quoted as saying that ‘there is no heavier burden than an unfulfilled potential.’ Our hope is that that the Human Potential Survey can play a small part in shedding some light on how that burden might be lifted.
“THERE IS NO HEAVIER BURDEN THAN AN UNFULFILLED POTENTIAL.”
— Charles M. Schulz, Cartoonist and creator of the comic strip Peanuts.
