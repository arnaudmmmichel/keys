Education is no longer a predictable, linear journey. These days, itâ€™s much more of a â€˜choose your own adventure storyâ€™.
More than ever before, students are dictating how, when and where they consume educational services. 
The typical profile of a higher education student, in particular, has undergone phenomenal transformation. The stereotype of the 18-24 year-old uni student or apprentice has given way to a much broader cross-generational further learning population.
The challenge for service providers is finding a way to communicate with such a diverse audience that resonates with each individualâ€™s personal circumstances, life stage and tech savviness. The one-size-fits-all approach just doesnâ€™t cut it anymore.Â 
You need to be able to segment audiences and tailor information to their needs, and you need to be able to deliver it fast. With a large number of educational clients in our portfolio, weâ€™re familiar with the issues you face. Weâ€™re experts in managing large volumes of data, integrating third party systems, automating routine tasks, and creating user journeys that help your audience quickly find the information they need.
A snapshot of our clients and industry recognition
It is difficult to imagine a more complex website rebuild than the task IIS and Luminary embarked on in late 2016. The site manages around 100,000 pieces of data and a wealth of purpose-built resources. Luminaryâ€™s design and technical teams came up with an approach that is enabling peopleâ€™s access to information relevant to their decision making, and connecting them with the physical networks that can take their enquiry further. Luminaryâ€™s solution also ensures that this is happening on the platforms the individual prefers to use. Project implementation was incredibly smooth, with the â€˜new siteâ€™ readily adopted in the field.

The internet has become so integral to tourism and hospitality that itâ€™s hard to even imagine how we ever got by without it. The upshot of this is that online competition in this sector is fierce.
More than 80 percent of travel planning is now conducted through the internet, and the narrative is increasingly being shaped by travellers and patrons rather than business operators themselves. 
At the same time, consumers are demanding lightning-fast assistance and expecting to have seamless experiences across multiple platforms â€“ from chatbots and email to face-to-face. Meanwhile, the proliferation of comparison sites is fuelling a race to the bottom on price. That is, unless youâ€™re prepared to invest in ways to rise above the noise.
At Luminary, we help clients in the Tourism & Hospitality sector produce first-quality digital platforms that allow them to eclipse the competition â€“ from stunning designs, to robust and scalable technical architecture. Weâ€™ll show you how to harness the power of consumer generated content and make sure your business gets found.Â

Kentico has given us everything we needed in a CMS, the right balance of off-the-shelf functionality coupled with the scope to be flexible to our changing needs.

The internet is flooded with pseudo-medical information and misguided health advice. The situation is compounded by the growing number of patients turning to the internet for answers to health-related problems. 
The challenge for legitimate health service providers is to establish trust and distinguish themselves from the cacophony of less-than-authoritative voices in this space. 
Having a high-quality website and supporting digital assets is absolutely essential to achieving this.Further, people with health concerns not only need to have access to reliable and accurate information, they also need to be able to find it easily.Â 
At Luminary, we see these objectives as baseline requirements. But we donâ€™t stop there. Our mission is to go beyond established norms and find even better and more innovative ways to utilise technology to help you improve the lives of the people who rely on your services.

While manufacturers were once beholden to retailers to get their products out to market, the internet has opened up a whole new avenue for selling products direct to consumers. 
This has meant that manufacturers have had to â€˜upâ€™ their game in terms of how they market their products and manage relationships with customers. 
Itâ€™s not just about sales and account management anymore, itâ€™s about really investing in the marketing function and raising your level of digital maturity. Underpinning all this is the need to capture and make sense of large volumes of product and customer data, and bring it all together in a way that speaks to the consumer market. So instead of just featuring a list of products, itâ€™s about presenting those products in their real-life contexts, and inspiring the consumer to want to know more.
At Luminary, weâ€™ve worked with many clients in the manufacturing sphere, helping them along the journey from digital novice to digital ninja. Our developers eat complex data integrations for breakfast, and with our solid e-commerce experience we have the expertise to guide you through the ever-growing morass of product management systems.Â 
A snapshot of our clients and industry recognition
FlexSelect has been extremely well received by our customers. It is a digital disruption to the industry and is breaking new ground in order to make the lives of Schneider Electricâ€™s customers easier. Despite Luminary not having any previous experience or knowledge of our custom Distribution Board offer, they understood what we were trying to achieve and have developed a tool that we are extremely happy with. The user interface is better than we were expecting and the simple usability of the tool largely contributes to its success.

For most people, dealing with finances is something that falls into the category of Tedious Life Necessity. So until they have a need to engage with you, it can be difficult to get peopleâ€™s attention.
A significant life event like a change of job, a new house purchase, or a pending retirement can be a good indication that someone might be in the right headspace to reconsider their financial affairs. 
And of course, there are the systematic triggers, like the expiry of a financial arrangement. All of these scenarios can present a risk of attrition; however if handled well, they can also be turned into an opportunity. But first you need to have the right technologies in place, and someone to guide you on how to use them in a way that doesnâ€™t overstep the boundaries.
Luminary specialises in turning our financial clientsâ€™ fine print into fine customer experiences. Weâ€™ll help you create timely and transparent communications that engender trust and confidence in your business, providing greater value to both you and your customers.
 A snapshot of our clients and industry recognition
Humeâ€™s challenge online was to maintain a highly reputable brand built upon local expertise, personable service and community support as traditionally expressed via our offline channels. With online now a primary (and at times only) means of interaction with our customers, picking the right agency to meet this challenge was crucial. Right from the kick off meeting and throughout the project, we were confident in our choice with the Luminary team. The team were collaborative in their approach, communicative, transparent, and willing to accommodate change as it arose; culminating in a design that satisfied our brief precisely.

 Technology has fundamentally changed the way citizens interact with government organisations and the level of service and transparency they expect. 
In todayâ€™s hyper-connected, customer-centric world, government bodies have had to radically adapt their approach to service delivery. 
People have become accustomed to services and information being â€˜always onâ€™ â€“ accessible from wherever they are, whenever they want. They expect their needs to be met quickly and frictionlessly, and government services are no exception.
At Luminary we have a long history of successful engagements with government departments and statutory bodies. We understand the need to ensure that regulatory requirements are met, and that your digital assets are scalable, reliable, accessible and secure. We are well-versed in dealing with the specific challenges that accompany any government project, from risk and stakeholder management to managing change within your organisation. Our ability to gracefully navigate these constraints and still produce highly innovative outcomes has seen Luminary cement its place as a long-standing and trusted advisor in the public sector.

In an environment of ever-increasing public scrutiny, charities and NFPs are under more pressure than ever to optimise limited funds and increase conversions. 
As a charity or NFP organisation, youâ€™re no doubt all too familiar with the challenge of trying to find creative ways to stretch your dollar further. 
And staying abreast of the latest ways to get your message heard is essential. Youâ€™re competing for attention and contributions not just against other comparable organisations, but also against regular businesses â€“ many of which are backed by large marketing engines with enviable budgets. With the majority of Australian charitable donors now preferring to give online, having a first-rate website is critical.
At Luminary, we provide charities and NFPs with the complete digital package, from best-in-class websites to effective email communications and marketing automation systems. Weâ€™ve honed our skills through many years of working with organisations in the sector, with current clients including Fred Hollows Foundation, Save The Children, The Heart Foundation, Cancer Council Australia, The Shrine of Remembrance, and The Australian Energy Market Regulator (AEMO), among others. Our credentials in this sector have been externally validated, with Fred Hollows Foundation topping the leaderboard for Large Health and Happiness Organisations in the 2019 
A snapshot of our clients and industry recognition
Right from the outset, Luminary took a very open and consultative approach to this project. All key stakeholders were brought into the discussion early on and we were presented with a clear, iterative plan for conversion optimisation testing. The project was delivered on time and on budget, with Luminary going above and beyond to deliver additional works outside of the original scope. Throughout the engagement, the Luminary teamâ€™s professionalism, thoroughness and attention to detail were exemplary.

Professional services firms face different challenges to consumer-focused businesses in the digital space. Thatâ€™s why you need an agency with solid experience in the sector.
For years, professional services firms have thrived on the â€˜handshake economyâ€™, with new business mostly coming through referrals and word-of-mouth. But the market has evolved. 
Having a digital strategy is no longer simply about appealing to the grad market. Your prospective clients are now spending more time online researching potential providers. Often, buyers have already formed a view about your firm before even reaching for the phone. The few professional services firms that are doing digital well, are reaping the rewards.
At Luminary, we have first-hand experience of the challenges of standing out in a crowded business-to-business market â€“ weâ€™re in those trenches too. Weâ€™ve also earnt a solid reputation as a go-to agency for professional services firms, with a range of clients in the legal, financial and corporate advisory sectors.

Widespread access to digital technology has radically changed the landscape for sectors like the Property & Construction market, where average purchase values are relatively high.
Consumers of high-value goods and services are no longer willing to put their faith in the hands of one company. Theyâ€™re doing their research well before they pick up the phone or enter your showroom. 
They know your products, they know your competitors, and they know what they should be paying. Your power to genuinely influence them at the point of sale is rapidly diminishing. This presents both a challenge and an opportunity. Smart operators are getting around this by creating content and offering digital platforms that engage the customer far earlier along their path to purchase.
Luminary will help you elevate your digital offering to create interactive and inspiring experiences for your prospects â€“ experiences that bring your products to life and make you stand out from the competition. And most importantly, experiences that generate more qualified leads for your business.
