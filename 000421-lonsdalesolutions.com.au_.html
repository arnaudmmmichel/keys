Complex business case preparation & approval
Building a successful Project Management Office (PMO) or Portfolio Management function can be imperative to realising organisational goals such as project delivery effectiveness and accountability. Building a successful PMO is a complex discipline and delivered poorly, PMO or Portfolio Management can become an expensive and wasteful headache that creates unnecessary barriers to delivery while losing the support of key senior managers.
We have proven and demonstrated experience in building new PMOs for large organisations. We have the capability to uplift existing governance or portfolio management functions and can be engaged to ensure your PMO is closely aligned to your organisation’s strategic objectives.

Portfolio investment , planning & prioritisation
We are proven experts in the creation, mobilisation and management of large customer centric business transformation programs ($300 million+) which have delivered real organisational transformation and bottom line savings across a range of client industries. Often incorporating emerging technology such as Robotic Process Automation, Salesforce, or advanced Data Analytics toolsets.
Successful and embedded transformation programs reduce costs, eliminate duplication and drive creation of new value. Change programs can be focussed on improving customer advocacy, organisational restructuring or driving cultural change but often fail to deliver on promised benefits; causing disruption, creating lost opportunity and escalating project costs.
While identifying the need to change is one thing, the specialised ability to structure and lead the delivery of a large customer centric transformational change program is another. Our Consultants work to understand key business drivers and design courses of action that build strategic alignment and create new business value.
