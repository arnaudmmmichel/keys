About 17 percent of the Amazonian rainforest has been destroyed over the past 50 years
Deforestation can be a strong driver of infectious disease transmission
Planting trees is the best way to tackle climate change
Every tree absorbs COâ out of the atmosphere, converts it into biomass and stores it as long as the forest is sustained. The concept is simple and has huge potential to be a lifesaver for our environment, as the most economical and effective way to tackle climate change
. That's not all though: Trees provide even more benefits for the ecosystem by supporting the biodiversity and animal life while keeping the ground fertile, which in turn supports local communities
. So every time a tree is planted it directly changes the world for the better.

We partner with WeForest to plant trees in Africa â in Tanzania and Zambia. Not only do the supported projects restore the forests in these regions, they also teach the local population to use these trees sustainably as their livelihood.
 Each time you donate seeds to support one of these projects we donate the cost of planting a tree together with our partners and sponsors. 100% of these donations go directly to WeForest.
Eden Reforestation has tree planting projects all over the world. We support two projects: The planting of Mangroves in Madagaskar to help maintain one of earthâs most diverse ecosystems and the animals living within and in Mosambik, where the reforestation is crucial as the forests which are being destroyed are a basis of life for the very poor population.
Each time you donate seeds to support one of these projects we donate the cost of planting a tree together with our partners and sponsors. 100% of these donations go directly to Eden Reforestation.

 expected to outweigh all the fish
About 12 million metric tons of plastic are thrown into the ocean annually
Billions of kilograms of plastic can be found in swirling convergences that make up about 40% of the world's ocean surfaces
Plastic kills more than 1.1 million seabirds and animals every year
Ocean plastics are a threat to
Every year around 12.7 million tonnes of plastic waste are washed into our oceans and stay there for decades. This has led to massive areas of floating plastic, like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is estimated to be as large as 500.000 m
 â around six times the size of Austria. Plastic is a serious hazard for the marine ecosystem and its inhabitants. Fish, whales and turtles get entangled in macroplastic and microplastic particles are consumed and digested, leading to various disorders and even death
. This is why our goal is to collect as much plastic out of the ocean as possible.
We partner with One Earth â One Ocean to collect plastic waste out of the sea. One Earth â One Ocean is on a mission to reduce the plastic in our oceans as much as possible by new and innovative means. Follow the shipsâ journeys in the Pacific ocean! 
Our partner shops sponsor the collection of plastic waste out of the ocean. By bringing your goodbag when you go shopping and tapping the blue coupon, you avoid single-use bags and fish one plastic bag out of the ocean!
We also work with brands who act as sponsors and support us by paying for the collection of certain amounts of plastic waste. 100% of these donations go directly to One Earth â One Ocean.

The possibilities for unique, upcycled and recycled material goodbags are limitless! Letâs make your idea for a collaboration reality.
You have a great idea but donât know how to realize it? We can help with that!
One great thing about bags is that they can be produced out of so many different materials. This opens up a lot of possibilities for upcycling or using recycled fabric and plastic in the production of custom goodbags based on your ideas. Together with our partner TwoLives and companies like Magenta and Audi we have upcycled goodbags from ad-banners and created goodbags out of recycled materials. This collaboration not only includes the production of the bags, but also social media cooperation to communicate the final product on all channels. For certain campaigns we collaborate with the Austrian Red Cross and donate all revenue from sales.
Case example â Audi Switzerland & TwoLives
We collaborated with Audi Switzerland and producer TwoLives to create a very special bag, upcycled from an Audi megaposter. This poster was originally displayed in the Bern Central Railway Station and when its time had come, Audi was so generous as to provide it for the project. Starting from the provided material, the overall communication, coordination and, of course, the final product, everything came together to be a very successful project with a great outcome for everyone involved and ultimately also the environment.
