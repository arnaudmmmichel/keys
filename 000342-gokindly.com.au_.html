 was created as a high quality, every day bedroom pillow which suits most people and is affordable. It provides support to a side sleeper with a special gusset to hold the pillow into shape.
The key to providing a quality pillow for a side sleeper is the loft and the firmness. Our Signature Pillow is a higher loft with a medium to firm feel. This is important for providing the right support and neck and body alignment for side sleepers.
Love this pillow even more because:
 is designed for the ultimate sleep.  Best for side sleepers as it has the height and support needed to align your neck and body for a comfortable nights sleep.
Generally a back sleeper will need a 
 to provide the lower level of height required for a supportive and comfortable nights sleep.
We often find that larger profile people enjoy having 2 lower style pillows rather than one Signature style. This allows them to build up and adjust the height suitable for them throughout the night. This may also be the case for those who move around a lot during the night, and sleep in multiple positions.
Love this pillow even more because:
Tummy or front sleepers need a pillow that supports their position.  That is why we created a 
.  When laying on your front you don't need the level of support that other pillows provide.  Instead the design of the Low & Soft pillow provides a soft cloud like feel and a softness that will align to the lower neck position. 
Love this pillow even more because:
 is designed for little people – aged 3+. It is a lower, softer profile pillow which little ones find more comfortable. It is a standard sized length, and fits inside a standard sized pillow case, but lower in profile to an adult pillow.
 apparently has nothing to do with Europe at all – its entirely a Australian concept. European pillows are the larger decorative pillows often found on beds. They are useful for propping yourself up when reading or watching TV in bed, especially when sick or tired. They offer some back support as well as being decorative. Check the size to ensure they fit your euro pillowslips.
Euro pillows are often used when styling a room, as they add depth and height to a bed dressing, as well as allowing you to add a pop of colour in the room.

 is an extra large pillow made for a stylish finish to your bed.  It is a soft and plush pillow that can be slept on, perfect for those that like a 5 star hotel pillow.  We have a number of king pillows on the couch to provide added comfort when watching TV and to snuggle.
After surgery or injury you may need an additional support pillow to offer elevation and support to an area to facilitate healing. The following are 2 popular styles of pillow for support.
 is a longer than normal standard pillow – think 2.5 pillows sewn together lengthwise. It is useful in recovery as it can be shifted around the body in various configurations – under and along the body, between legs, under arms and heads.
It is a multi-purpose pillow suitable for all ages and injury/surgery types. It is light weight – so easy to manoeuvre with an injury. It can also be folded in half for use to prop yourself up in the place of a European pillow.
 is a u-shaped pillow perfect for supporting the front or back of the body after injury or surgery. It is useful as a ‘pillow table’ when reading or working during recovery, and between the legs to support legs or knees after surgery. It is a firmer style pillow and has a bit of weight in it. It is easy to manoeuvre – but does have more weight than the Body Pillow.
is a medium firm, curved pillow designed to support new parents with sleep and feeding. The Pregnancy pillow is good in the later stages of pregnancy for support between the legs, to support aching hips and legs. It is also useful for propping upright in a bed or sofa in the later months of pregnancy when fatigue and heart burn can hit together.
This pillow transitions well to a feeding pillow, by turning it round to curve around the body and placing baby on top of the pillow while feeding.

      Australia's First Pillow Recycling Program – #GoKindly
    
meta description:We've partnered with a local fabric recycler to create first closed loop Australian pillow recycling program, and put an end to pillow waste.

Australia's First Pillow Recycling Program – #GoKindly
, and put an end to pillow waste.
We have always been passionate about sustainability.  When we first launched #GoKindly, it was frustrating to learn that there was no program for recycling old and manky pillows.  Instead, they end up in landfill.
over 20 million tonnes of waste to landfill
 every year.  We want to be part of reducing this, not contributing to it.
Our recycling program allows you to return your old #GoKindly pillow and get 15% off your next pillow purchase.
More details about the program are below. 
Want to return and recycle your pillow? Click 
Return your #GoKindly pillow at the end of its life and we’ll recycle it with our Australian fabric recycling program.
We recommend your #GoKindly pillows are replaced every 2 years to ensure good sleep hygiene.  
To minimise waste and ensure a closed loop we've created Australia's first pillow recycling program. 
Our local partner shreds and creates new yarn from fabric at end of life, so your pillow will live on in another form and not contribute to landfill.
Our Memory Foam Pillow is recycled into carpet underlay.
Why do we need this program?
We've always been passionate about sustainability, closed loop processes and high quality product creation.  When we founded #GoKindly we focused on creating products that had a long lifespan, were high quality (washable, well sewn, functional) and affordable.
Before you choose to recycle your #GoKindly pillow we encourage you to re-purpose your old pillows in creative ways.  For instance, use it to make cushions, pet beds, and arts and craft.
Sadly, all goods have a lifespan, and we've found it difficult to find affordable and practical recycling, and end of life programs.  
We're delighted and excited to find an Australian fabric recycler to partner with and close the loop in line with our values.
Our commitment to you (and the world) is that your pillow will be recycled into new yarn, for a new life.
What are the pillow recycling challenges?
While our recycler is based here in Australia, the market for yarn in Australia is low. We simply don’t manufacture here like the 1970’s, so no one needs to buy large volumes of yarn. The yarn from our recycled pillows is usually used in India for manufacturing of new goods and garments.
Our Memory Foam Pillow is recycled into carpet underlay.
The returns process is also challenging.  Due to the cost of postage for returns, we need to charge a fee.  
Alternatively you can drop your old pillow off to our recycling bin at our studio. 
Do you recycle all types of pillows?
If you are recycling a #GoKindly Memory Foam Pillow, European, Body or Boomerang pillow please contact us at info@gokindly.com.au
How do I return my pillow for recycling?
Follow the steps outlined on our 
return and recycle my pillow request
What is the cost of returning my pillow?
Due to the cost of postage we need to charge a fee of $5 per pillow.  However, you can drop off your pillow at our studio.  Should you live nearby or are travelling through email us at info@gokindly.com.au for more information. 
Where does my recycled pillow go?
Our recycling partner is based in Melbourne, they shred and begin the process of taking the fabric back to yarn, and sorting by colour. It is then shipped to India for the final stages of creating and spinning yarn and goes back into the manufacturing process.
The memory foam pillow is recycled into carpet underlay.
