          Business as a force for good
We are humbled and proud to announce that since Feb 2022 we're now a certified B Corp!
At its core, B Corp is a robust and holistic measurement of a business's social and environmental impact.
For us, it's a way to step into more accountability and transparency over how we choose to do business.
Our commitment is to widen our aperture of care to become a far-more-than-sustainable business, and B Corp acknowledges and holds us to account for that promise.
Becoming a certified B Corp means we believe that:
¬†We need to redefine the purpose of business and;
¬†That this redefinition can be a positive impulse for a better future.
We believe we need a systems change in how we do business, away from extraction and towards regeneration. And we need to create a cultural container that acknowledges this fundamental transition in business ethics, purpose and potential.
For us, B Corp certification is that container. B Corp provides, we think, an excellent path to help challenge and promote best practices for businesses in this critical moment. It helps us with our internal framing about how and why we do what we do and who benefits/is affected by what we choose to do. It also lets you, our community, see exactly what's going on at Minimum with complete transparency.
Businesses should be like greenhouses; you can see inside from all angles, a space where healthy things are being propagated, things you can enjoy too, things that bring joy. That's why we're a B Corp; it's our commitment to always be better: for us, and for you.
We've been nominated as 'Best For The World' in 2022!
Each year, B Corp HQ recognise global B Corps who score in the¬†
¬†within their different impact areas. In 2022 we have been recognised as being top 5% for our work with¬†
. With only 71 businesses in Aus/NZ receiving the top 5% status, it's something we're pretty proud of, especially given we only became a B Corp in this year. Always more work to do, but what a¬†beautiful beginning!

Paying the rent is a step we take with you, collectively:
it acknowledges that we live on stolen land,
that First Nations sovereignty was never ceded,
Each quarter, payment is made to a First Nations-led, grassroots organisation. So far, rent payments have been paid to:
This is just one of of many steps we can take in solidarity;
we hope to take many more, with you.
Here's a little more info on the organisations...
To help celebrate International Women's Day, our first rent payment will be made to Djirra (Naarm).
Djirra is predominantly designed by and for Aboriginal women, a place where practical support is available to all Aboriginal women, particularly to those who are currently experiencing family violence or have in the past.
Djirra is the Woiwurrung word for the reed used by Wurundjeri women for basket weaving.
Pay The Rent is a grassroot-to-grassroots organisation, based on the lands of the Kulin Nation.
Run by a Sovereign Body of First Nations representatives, Pay The Rent ensures decisions are made transparently and are centred around the needs of First Nations people.
Rent payments are payments made for the use and benefit of occupying Aboriginal land, and as a mechanism of reparation.
The vineyard from which we harvest our grapes is located on Yorta Yorta Country, stolen land.
Yorta Yorta Nation Aboriginal Corporation (YYNAC) is comprised of peoples with unequivocal bloodlines to the Original Ancestors of Yorta Yorta Country. YYNAC represents the descendants of these Original Ancestors and they have the power and right to approve/deny Cultural Heritage on Yorta Yorta Country.
Firesticks Alliance Indigenous Corporation is an Indigenous-led network that aims to restore cultural burning practices by facilitating cultural learning pathways to fire and land management. It is an initiative for Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to look after Country, continuously building on past knowledge to form new connections and identities.
Firesticks Alliance also focuses on the mentorship of future fire stewards and scientific monitoring to better understand fire's ecological impact on Country.
Thanks to you we've planted¬†over 12,700¬†trees so far!!
We feel so grateful to be able to plant one tree for every dozen sold. Here is a little info on where your trees¬†have been planted most recently...
Within the Ancestral Domain of the Dumagat and Alta Indigenous communities. Aurora, Philippines.
Native and endemic species including White/Red Lauan (Shorea contorta/negrosensis), Mayapis (Shorea palosapis), Yakal (Shorea astylosa), Malakatmon (Dillenia luzoniensis), Tangile (Shorea polysperma), Malabayabas (Tristaniopsis decorticata) and Agarwood (Aquilaria malaccensis).
The planting project (988 acres) is located within the Ancestral Domain of the Dumagat and Alta Indigenous communities in the municipality of San Luis, province of Aurora in northeastern Philippines. Aurora Province is located in the central portion of the Sierra Madre Biodiversity Corridor (SMBC), and the numerous degraded planting sites have specific characteristics that require different approaches. A primary goal of the project is to restore native vegetation to protect the areas from landslide and sea-level rise (as the areas are within 400m from the shoreline). Whilst being the ancestral homeland of the Dumagat and Alta Peoples, crucial for hunting, timber, food/medicine and sacred ritual sites, the area is also home to the critically endangered Philippine Eagle and several other endangered or vulnerable species. The local community will be the primary stakeholders and will manage the project and outcomes themselves, with mentorship and up-skilling where needed.
Point Pearce, Yorke Peninsula, South Australia.
Mallee Box, Golden Wattle, Drooping Sheoak, Native Apricot, Wreath Wattle, Umbrella Bush, Elegant Wattle, Coast Bitter-Bush, Common Oak-Bush, Sweet Bursaria, Native Scurf-Pea, Black-Anther Flax-Lily, Sticky Hop-Bush, Ruby Saltbush, White Goodenia, Dwarf Hakea, Dryland Tea-Tree, Coast Daisy-Bush, Twiggy Daisy-Bush &amp; Seaberry Saltbush.
Located in an Indigenous Protected Area on the Yorke Peninsula (South Australia), Nurungga Country, is a Eucalyptus Porosa (Mallee Box) woodland. Named Marna Banggara (marna = ‚Äòhealthy or prosperous‚Äô and banggara = ‚ÄòCountry‚Äô), the project collaborates with Landcare Australia and the Nurungga Traditional Owners to restore native vegetation and increase landscape connectivity on this site. The site is home to several threatened species, including the Southern Hairy Nosed Wombat. The carbon rights generated by the project will be owned and managed by the Narungga Community and the Indigenous Land Council, and the goal is to revegetate 350 hectares this year!
Predominately Inga, Avocado, Citrus, Rambutan & Cacao with some other hardwood and fruiting trees depending on the specific micro-climates of each site.
For over nine years, a group of Honduran locals have been establishing a network of organic, regenerative agroforestry farms. Utilising mainly alley cropping (planting rows of trees, in between which crops are planted), the group has worked with over 300 subsistence farming families to establish agroforestry systems. The major goal of the project is to help establish climate-smart systems that deliver food sovereignty within 2-3 years, as well as increasing soil fertility, nutrient cycling and crop diversity. Another goal of the project is to hopefully present regenerative agroforestry as a substitute for the fairly common, but destructive, technique of slash-and-burn agriculture by using trees to fix nitrogen in the soil. The project also helps prevent erosion and helps to maintain watersheds and in some cases revive long-lost springs.
Women-led mangrove restoration¬†in India: Part II
Avicennia marina, avicennia officinalis, axcoecaria agallocha, rhizophora mucronata, bruguiera gymnorrhiza as well as some supporting species like thespesia populne and hibiscus tiliaceus.
Around 350 hectares of mangroves in the Krishna District of Andhra Pradesh (a South-Eastern state of India) will be restored via community participation. As well as the initial mangrove plantings, a nursery with capacity of 400,000 mangrove saplings per year will be established by a network of 10 women-led community groups. The plantings will be space at around 3,300 per hectare, with a 50-hectare zone dedicated to an integrated shellfish/fish farming operation. Not only will this restore ecological niches for a variety of species (fish, bivalves, birds, etc) it will also function as a much needed buffer against strong winds/waves and encroaching salinity issues from global warming-induced changes to the ocean. The project will see around 100 hectares of salt-effected agricultural land being re-engaged with as mangrove-based agricultural and aquaculture, directly benefitting an estimated 5,000 people in the region.
Monarch Butterfly¬†habitat planting in Mexico
Cerro del Cacique, Zitacuaro, Michoac√°n, Mexico.
One of the greatest (multi-generational) migration stories in the natural world is that of the monarch butterfly of the North Americas. For those living east of the Rockies, they fly down to Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve in the Michoac√°n, Mexico. Second, third and fourth generations of monarchs then make the long flight back north. This tree planting project is located in Michoac√°n, a critical habitat for the monarchs that are seeing their nesting tree Oyamel (Abies religiosa) suffer due to climate change and extractive industries. Exploitatory logging pressure and higher temperatures (Oyamel is slowly dying back lower down on the mountain from the heat of climate change) is reducing and displacing the Oyamel and local peoples, and in turn is massively effecting the migratory nesting grounds of the monarchs. This project aims to plant 400,000 trees in Michoac√°n (Oyamel, some native pines and other trees/shrubs), alongside a number of other affiliated projects in the area to help not only the monarchs, but with the general health of the Michoac√°n ecosystem. This project is underway in tight cooperation with local communities,¬†who will be heavily involved with the planting, and will see the ecological/social benefits that flow on from¬†the restoration.
Women-led mangrove restoration¬†in India: Part I
Predominately planting a multi-species mix of four genera: avicennia, ceriops, bruguiera and rhizophora.
We're especially stoked to be able to support this small mangrove restoration project, run entirely by local women in India. The restoration site is a 7-acre mudflat that's severely degraded, however the initial stages of the project are to set up a local nursery and train a group of local women in the fine (and apparently quite difficult) art of germinating and growing mangrove saplings. Saplings will be raised from seed collected from nearby mangrove forests and planted at a density of 1,200 saplings per acre. The crew will then follow up in 2023 to re-plant around 2,000 saplings given they're likely to lose 15-20% of saplings in the first year. In addition to re-planting over time, the crew is setting up a surveillance and monitoring system (called Mangrove Watch) to generate ongoing data and to help establish long-term health of the budding mangrove forest.
Regeneration for climate resilience in Rwanda
Eastern and Western Provinces of Rwanda.
Grevillea, acuminata, cedrela, river tamarind, calliandra, tree tomato, passionfruit, nile tulip, citrus, red hot poker tree, umbrella tree, yellowwood tree plus several other native understory plants.
The overall goal of this project is to regenerate degraded mountainous areas in several parts of Rwanda. The idea is to improve climate resilience by improving soil fertility, generate better agro-ecosystems to help farmers and land managers, protect and improve biodiversity around critical watersheds and enhance community dynamics and food sovereignty in the surrounding areas. There's a big focus on collaboration and community involvement in this project, especially in regards to up-skilling local farmers in agroforestry and silvopasture techniques. The project's moto is "Collaborative Action for Nature and People" (which we love!). In terms of plants, a number of different evergreen, deciduous, fruiting and understory plants will be used, providing the necessary diversity to help restore a dynamic ecosystem.

We feel incredibly grateful¬†for the privilege that it was to curate and host ARISE, a¬†group exhibition of 13 artists, to raise awareness and funds for the
in Naarm (Melbourne), Nov 12‚Äî14, 2021.
Over the weekend of November 12-14, artworks from the 13 artists¬†were shown and paired with a public Instagram auction. All proceeds¬†went directly to the ASRC to support their programs such as the Wise Women Sisterhood Journey, empowering women seeking asylum to discover who they are and who they want to become.
In conjunction with the exhibition,¬†we launched our new Short Runs Field Ros√©
(one of the 13 artists). $1 from the sale of every bottle produced will be donated to the ASRC, alongside all proceeds from the exhibition.
In total, we raised an incredible $17,400 for the ASRC! We were blown away by the support of both the artists and everyone who purchased artwork.
ARISE came about as a way to honour and hear the many voices of our community. To all of the artists, to the team at Oig√•ll Projects, and to the ASRC: THANK YOU all so much for being such amazing humans.
Conversations¬†was our second group show of 20 artists exploring the innate interconnectivity between ideas, energies and people.
These dynamics have the ability to deepen¬†eco-social communities, build synergies and evoke wild flares of creativity. And it's often accidental. Spontaneous. Unplanned. Elements might connect unexpectedly and click into a pattern. Or not.¬†A vase and a piece of fruit on a table create a still life. Oil meets water and creates a rainbow. A¬†yin forms a yang. A circle appears. Intentions, directional impulses, dialogues. An encounter between lovers. Two tones from two hands. A melody.¬†Up at 2am. Talking. Gesturing. Merging. Diverging. Emerging. Urging. Entirely¬†ordinary. Kind of extraordinary.
rtworks from the 20 artists¬†were¬†on show and for sale, from¬†
, beginning with an opening night party on¬†
, where we poured some vibey new releases.¬†
After¬†ARISE a big learning was wanting to support and acknowledge the artists¬†efforts and contributions, so for CONVERSATIONS:
50% of sales went directly to the artists.
50% of sales went directly to Pay The Rent.
2022 also had a very different feeling to 2021 in Australia (let's just say the vibe had turned a little less 'optimistic' for a moment), and as a result many pieces in this exhibition didn't sell. but we feel so grateful that we were still able to raise a
$1,740¬†rent payment from the sale of artworks and decided to double it, to contribute a final rent payment of¬†$3,480
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU, to the artists, to Honey Bones Gallery, to Molly Rose for your brews and sours, and to everyone who put in the mountain of time and energy¬†that made this happen. Our cups are full of gratitude.
