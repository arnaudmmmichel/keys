meta title:Purpose | Portable
meta description:Portable seeks out areas across social need and policy failure to create transformational change using research, design and technology.

Our mission is to seek out areas of social need and policy failure and make transformational change using research, design and technology.
We believe that government, organisations and businesses can be forces for good. But there's a gap in their understanding of, and ability to meet, the expectations of those in need of positive change. Our job is to use design and technology to narrow that gap between those with the power and responsibility to make positive change, and those who need it. 
We care about these big issues, among many others, and we work with partners to get there across Australia and the region. But often we find ourself in situations where there are opportunities to respond directly to issues we uncover.  We do this by self initiating our own research and development to explore and respond to these issues. Some of these areas over the past decade include:
: we work with organisations like 
 to enhance delivery of youth mental health services.
: we're on a mission to unlearn school and have worked with 
 to bring human-centred design to public schooling.
ageing and death are in need of optimism
, and we believe that systems thinking and human-centred design can be a force for good â so we wrote 
We care about doing good work.
Good work means quality work, but also work that matters. At Portable, we care about and talk about what makes our work good from both perspectives. We think carefully about what good looks like and set clear expectations on what we set out to achieve. And we seek to understand and connect the good work we're doing to our purpose. We're proud of what we deliver. We never phone it in or tick the box.
We get stuck in when there's work to be done, but recognise that sometimes doing good work consistently actually means stepping away for a while, and that's okay. And we don't "go rogue" when it comes to doing what we believe is good work. We respect the plan the team has created and if that plan needs to change, we agree on a new plan as a team.
At Portable, we frequently share and test new ideas and processes, and we make space for everyone to contribute to that. There's usually a better way, and we're flexible enough to explore those possibilities. We're curious and creative and go wide for learning and inspiration. 
We experiment purposefully in order to find the right solution. We push ourselves to try new things, but at the same time, make it safe for ourselves and others to fail.
At Portable, we work as a team. We don't believe in hero efforts where individuals go off on their own. We believe good work happens when we collaborate well to achieve our goals. When we make a commitment to others, we stick to it. When things go wrong, we don't point fingers, but we take responsibility for our part. 
When we can't deliver on our commitments, we let our team know as early as possible. We get that sometimes people get stuck, and that's okay. We're brave enough to ask for help, and accept and encourage others to do the same. We speak honestly and build real relationships with each other. We do the work it takes to understand others and actively include their unique perspectives and differences. And throughout it all, we remember to let fun bubble up around the work.
Portable is a place to learn and grow. When things go well, we celebrate and build on the success, but when they don't, we make sure we take the time to reflect and learn. We learn from and utilise our teammates' strengths whilst supporting them to work on their weaknesses.
We give respectful feedback that helps others learn and grow and we actively seek it from others to improve our work. When we receive feedback at Portable, we acknowledge it respectfully so that people feel safe to share feedback again.
We have always been driven by a mission to use technology to help transform sectors and industries.
As a company and a group of individuals, weâre proud to be recognised as a B-Corp, an organisation that seeks to create value for their stakeholders by looking after its customers, employees, organisational community and overall environment. B-Corps help generate equality in the workplace and show commitment to redefining what matters most to their working community. You can find out more about our 
Self-initiated research and development in areas we care about
We have an active program of self-initiated research and development in areas we care about, think we can make positive change and use design to speculate on the future and create discussion. We use our R&D insights to contribute to government inquiries and commissions, such as to the Australian Human Rights Commission, NSW Law Reform Commission Australian Government Department of Health's Aged Care Charter of Rights. We've worked in:
As part of our mission to help identify areas of social need and policy failure, we as a team actively look to give back to communities in need. We do this by prioritising areas of focus and allowing mechanisms to make donations possible within the company.
We regularly contribute to some or all of a project's hours to under-resourced causes we care about. 
We regularly donate to charitable causes, recent donations include 
As of July 2020, we have directly funded communities around the world to make change, through micro-loans. To date we have loaned over $250,000 USD. See our

meta title:Process | Portable
meta description:Portable seeks out areas across social need and policy failure to create transformational change using research, design and technology.

After more than 800 design and innovation projects, our tried, tested and refined approach allows us to rapidly deliver user-centred insights, prototypes, brands, products and services.
Starting with a design thinking framework, we assemble the best tools and process for each engagement. These methods have been tried, tested and refined. And allow us to rapidly deliver user-centred insights, prototypes, products and services.
All teams at Portable are multi-disciplinary, comprising researchers, producers, designers and developers. Service delivery occurs in the most agile way possible. When a team structured and working like this takes ownership of a project from start to end, the outcomes are desirable, viable and feasible products and services.
Our client work and internal R&D are backed by our own commitment to innovating our processes. We support the Australian Governmentâs Digital Service Standard with its focus on open-source, accessible, user-focused design and development. Weâre a proud B-Corp. Weâre ISO9001 compliant and certified.
The methodologies that guide our practice
Design is the process of solving problems with strategy and creativity. Human-centred design just means we consider people's needs and behaviour a higher priority than other objectives.
Co-design can be a philosophy, a practice and an event in time. We define it as an approach to design that actively involves all stakeholders â employees, partners, customers, experts, end users â to help ensure the result is feasible, viable and meets their needs.
Portable is adept at using agile project management techniques, and we regularly adapt them for fixed-cost projects. Clients take part in sprints, standups, showcases and retrospectives, and communication channels are always open.
Portable has procedures and principles to promote the highest standard of accessibility in our projects. Research and design activities aim to co-design the most inclusive products possible by consulting people with diverse backgrounds and abilities in the process.
Certification to the ISO 9001 Quality Management System standard means Portable has put an international-standard quality management standard at the core of its delivery, with a strict approval and testing framework, and full-time software QA team.
Addressing social need and policy challenges means starting every project with a goal, a user and overall indicators to measure its impact. When designs go out in the world, we collect quantitative and qualitative feedback on its use and impact.
We tackle projects in three phases
The Define phase at Portable is where our design strategists, experience designers, and technologists look widely to explore problem spaces for the most important issues to solve, or evaluate user experiences with existing products or services. Even if we're not doing a 'Define Phase', these tools and activities are used at the start of pretty much all the work we do.
At Portable, the Design phase is where things really start to take shape. By putting the end-user at the centre when designing products or services, we get a community-driven and participatory approach to solving problems, which not only results in better solutions, but creates ownership among customers and internal stakeholders.
In the Deliver phase of our work, our in-house team of creative technologists and software engineers comes to the fore, using DevOps practices to collaborate and continuously integrate and deploy. Even before this stage, Portable's technical experts consult on projects from the start, in order to design systems, assess existing infrastructure, and select the best tools and languages to fit user needs, business requirements and budget.
We learn from an active internal R&D program
Self-initiated research and development in areas we care about
We have an active program of self-initiated research and development in areas we care about, think we can make positive change and use design to speculate on the future and create discussion. We use our R&D activities to hone our skills and capabilities in strategy, design research and emerging technology. We've worked in:

Products that put people first | Portable
Building products that put people first
We collaborate with organisations to create products which drive truly transformational change.
After delivering more than 900 successful projects over the past decade, we know how important it is to put people first when creating products which aim to have a profound impact.
We're always looking for new opportunities to help bring innovative ideas to life. Discover how we can work together to take your products to the next level through thoughtful research, intuitive design, agile development and ongoing support.
Multiple initiatives supporting young people's access to mental health services.
A digital tool supporting those attending court with simple tailored information.
An AI powered tool which simplifies the process of dividing assets for separating couples.
A digital wayfinding and ticketing system which supports complex court processes.
Multiple initiatives to help bridge the gap in accessing critical legal services.
A web-based tool which guides people to end of life support, services and information.
We work with you and your team to understand why your product is needed and the problem it aims to solve. We then work alongside your team to design, test and iterate the product to make improvements to meet the needs of your audience.
During the Define phase we work with you and your team to explore the problems or issues that youâre aiming to solve. For existing products, we use the Define phase to evaluate the experience from the audienceâs point of view and explore ways to improve it.
The Design phase is where things really start to take shape. During this phase we test our designs early and often, to ensure they meet the needs of your audience. This human-centred and community driven approach enables us to design better products, resulting in a more satisfied audience.
During the Deliver phase our in-house team of technical experts collaborates with you to deliver your finished product. By engaging with the project from the very start, theyâre able to select the best platform and tools to reflect your audienceâs needs, and your business requirements and budget.
These are just some of the examples of products we've built and the long-term partnerships we've held to help drive transformational change.
An AI-powered solution for separating couples
Amica is part of a coordinated effort across all legal aid jurisdictions to refer clients and increase their online service delivery. It provides a low-cost alternative to private family lawyers and increases access to legal services for amicable couples who wouldnât otherwise be able to afford legal help.
Empowering young people to support themselves and each other
We worked with headspace to create a platform that equips young people to build a personal mental health toolkit, and share resources with their peers.

We believe in putting people first in our designs
Solving complex problems today requires more than thinking up unique solutions and moving through agile implementation. The needs of individuals, organisations, and populations are rapidly changing. Collaborating with the people who matter most and innovating through collaborative design processes is critical if weâre to make the kind of impact in the world we need. 
Our Ethical Human Centred Design Foundations workshop provides you with the training and resources to begin thoughtfully collaborating with the people youâre designing for. It also helps  develop your understanding of the ethical implications of unconscious bias as well as the ways in which we can identify our assumptions before taking action.
The proof is in our portfolio
We use human-centred design and ethical co-design every day at Portable to overcome difficult challenges with practical solutions, created in collaboration with people who areÂ  seeking transformational change. Using these practices, our team of designers, strategists and technologists have successfully delivered over 900 projects across a range of impact areas including mental health, access to justice, government innovation, and more.Â 
We believe that by sharing our knowledge with like-minded individuals, we can further promote truly positive change through thoughtful design practices that keep people at the centre of the solution.Â Â Â Â 
What you can expect in your workshop
We've designed our training sessions to provide industry-leading value
The principles and processes of Human-Centred Design
Introduce you to human-centred design and build awareness about how it can be used to understand problems and to design solutions.
The value of considering ethical implications
Learn about co-design in action, and the core principles and approaches to an ethical practice.
Applying the theory in a rapid design challenge
Gain hands-on experience of human-centred design through an experiential activity that moves through a âDouble-Diamondâ design process.
How to take these skills to your next project
By the end of the session, youâll have a practical, foundational understanding of what it means to practise ethical human-centred design.
What people are saying about our training
I found the human centred design course exciting and practical. I thought the facilitators were skilled and adept at creating a safe online environment where people felt comfortable sharing. I was impressed by the content and excited to learn more!
The course was so well run. I love how interactive it was â it didnât feel like youâd spent half a day on zoom at all! It provided a great introduction to HCD and I went away with lots to think about.
A great introduction to this topic â using real world examples, an online participation engagement tool, and practical group exercises, we were walked through the deeper level of participation required to work with people, rather than for people.
I want to thank you for the engaging HCD session. It was really great to learn about HCD with an ethical lens and the spectrum of engagement â something that I'm definitely going to dive into more after attending this session!
Our workshops are run by experienced Portable leaders who work with our clients to research, design, implement, and improve products and services that make a real impact on the lives of those they serve. 
Restricting the number of attendees in our workshops ensures that youâre given the opportunity to take full advantage of the content and our facilitators. Invest your time with confidence that it will develop your knowledge and skills to practically apply to your next project.
We understand the value of learning by doing. Thatâs why our workshops are designed to provide you with a combination of fundamental theory, practical exercises and thought-provoking discussions. Youâll also receive our Ethical Human Centred Design Toolkit to support your future projects. 
Portable's playbook: The Ethical HCD Toolkit
Our experts have worked hard to embed ethical principles and processes into all of our projects and we're happy to say that all attendees will be given access to Portable's personal HCD playbook. This toolkit provides you with the tools and resources to facilitate human-centred design projects that benefit your outcomes and the people youâre supporting.Â 
 and Principal Design Strategist at Portable, Belinda is responsible for driving human-centred design principles, and challenging clients to always design with the end-user and communities in mind. 
Belinda uses qualitative research and design thinking to develop, facilitate and synthesise co-design and research projects to better understand the core problems that shape potential solutions for clients.
Need training for your team, department or entire organisation?
As experts in capability building, the Portable team regularly facilitates co-design and ethical human-centred design workshops with organisations across each of our key impact areas including mental health, justice, the public sector and more.
Our Ethical Human Centred Design Foundations course has been designed to accommodate those from all diverse backgrounds and industries.Â 
No prior knowledge of human-centred design is required, with working groups being assigned based on a range of skills and experience.Â 
With our experts there to support you throughout the session, weâre confident that youâll find the course to be engaging and enjoyable while ensuring that you walk away with the tools to succeed.
How do I access the course content?
Our Ethical Human Centred Design Foundations course is facilitated using Miro and Zoom. While there is no prior knowledge required, we do recommend creating an account for these programs and ensuring that you have a reliable internet connection on the day.Â Â 
Youâll receive an email in the week leading up to the event which covers everything youâll need to be ready on the day.
Once the session is complete, youâll be given access to the course content, the Human Centred Design Toolkit, and the appropriate contact details to ensure that you can apply the skills youâve gained out in the real world.Â Â Â Â 
Are there any other courses available?
Weâre always updating our planned courses so be sure to sign up to our waiting list if you feel that the upcoming training sessions arenât suitable.Â 
Itâs important to note that the primary content covered in our Ethical Human Centred Design Foundations courses remains consistent across all sessions. We assign impact areas and sectors as a way of guiding the attendees to attend sessions likely to contain individuals from similar industries to facilitate more engaging conversations in working groups.
Do you offer organisational or team-based sessions?
We sure do! Portable regularly facilitates co-design and ethical human-centred design workshops with organisations across mental health, justice, the public sector, and more.Â

Values that align with our work
We care about doing good work.
Good work means quality work, but also work that matters. At Portable, we care about and talk about what makes our work good from both perspectives. We think carefully about what good looks like and set clear expectations on what we set out to achieve. And we seek to understand and connect the good work we're doing to our purpose. We're proud of what we deliver. We never phone it in or tick the box.
We get stuck in when there's work to be done, but recognise that sometimes doing good work consistently actually means stepping away for a while, and that's okay. And we don't "go rogue" when it comes to doing what we believe is good work. We respect the plan the team has created and if that plan needs to change, we agree on a new plan as a team.
At Portable, we frequently share and test new ideas and processes, and we make space for everyone to contribute to that. There's usually a better way, and we're flexible enough to explore those possibilities. We're curious and creative and go wide for learning and inspiration.
We experiment purposefully in order to find the right solution. We push ourselves to try new things, but at the same time, make it safe for ourselves and others to fail.
At Portable, we work as a team. We don't believe in hero efforts where individuals go off on their own. We believe good work happens when we collaborate well to achieve our goals. When we make a commitment to others, we stick to it. When things go wrong, we don't point fingers, but we take responsibility for our part.
When we can't deliver on our commitments, we let our team know as early as possible. We get that sometimes people get stuck, and that's okay. We're brave enough to ask for help, and accept and encourage others to do the same. We speak honestly and build real relationships with each other. We do the work it takes to understand others and actively include their unique perspectives and differences. And throughout it all, we remember to let fun bubble up around the work.
Portable is a place to learn and grow. When things go well, we celebrate and build on the success, but when they don't, we make sure we take the time to reflect and learn. We learn from and utilise our teammates' strengths whilst supporting them to work on their weaknesses.
We give respectful feedback that helps others learn and grow and we actively seek it from others to improve our work. When we receive feedback at Portable, we acknowledge it respectfully so that people feel safe to share feedback again.
