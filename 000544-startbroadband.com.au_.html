We’re on a mission to close the digital gap
Did you know that around 2 million Australians are living without the internet? 
And when we consider our reliance on the internet for education, essential services, social inclusion and employment opportunity… 
It’s not exactly a fair go, is it?
That’s why we came up with a plan. A broadband plan
we help low-income Aussies get online
. Thanks to our customers, we’ve delivered 
over 37,820 days of free internet
And the best part? You don’t have to do anything. Just by signing up to Start you’re giving back. You’re literally our favourite person for streaming Netflix in your trackies (tough job but someone’s gotta do it, eh?) 
Kathy is one of the hundreds of Aussies we’ve connected to the internet through our Life-Changing Connections Program. 
An absolute superwoman, Kathy is raising five children, volunteering in an aged-care home and is fluent in four languages. Yet securing paid work (and an internet connection) has been an uphill battle.
Thanks to our Start Customers, Kathy has a stable home internet connection. That means access to essential services, social inclusion and easier access to online study for her children (and no more daily trips to the local library).  
What does a stable internet connection mean to a family who’s been going without?
Because all Aussie kids deserve the same opportunities as their classmates. 
Gone are the days of newspaper job adverts. An internet connection enables easier job searching.  
With so many essential services moving online, this one’s a no-brainer. 
The internet provides a space for friendships, community, news and updates. 
As we become more reliant on the internet, it’s never been more important to build up online skills.
Every Aussie family and kids should be given the same opportunities from the get-go.

This is the start of something bigger
, a telecommunications provider who believes 
every Australian deserves access to the internet
And we tick all the boxes of what a broadband company should be: simple, fast and reliable (because time is precious when there are so many cat videos to watch).
But we decided to take it one step further. We created a local, people-first approach and vowed away from lock-in contracts.
But we haven’t even told you the best bit. We donate a share of every single bill to fund home internet connections for low-income Aussie families currently living without a connection. It’s all part of our bigger plan to close the digital gap.
Alright, you caught us. We used to work for the big broadband names. You know, the land of the corporates.
Nothing against these folks, though. Plus, it’s what allowed us to notice two key issues in the industry that we otherwise wouldn’t have. 
Working for the big names, we kept coming across customers who couldn’t afford the internet. And not just our internet – but any internet. This wasn’t such an issue back in the days of screeeeeeching dial up when the internet was a luxury.
But today, around 2 million Australian’s still don’t have regular access to the internet. And as technology progresses and we become increasingly reliant, this gap is only getting wider.
So at Start, we want to connect the unconnected. Today, we donate a percentage of every single bill to help low-income Aussies get online.
In corporate land, we also found the broadband process far more complicated than it needed to be. In today’s digital world, connection should be seamless.
So that’s what we did. Simply sign up with Start and your very own dedicated account manager will help make sure you’re smoothly and swiftly connected to the world wide web.
Great service, even better ethos. We switched to Start Broadband for their data and speed, but were won over by their social enterprise factor.
