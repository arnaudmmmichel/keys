Global debt markets are deep and liquid, with fixed income yields giving investors certainty over a predetermined payment schedule. 
However, individual debt issues also have unique risk premia such as term, liquidity, volatility, credit & impact metrics which create inefficiencies and relative value trading opportunities.​
Artesian is a global credit & impact specialist, small enough to capitalise on niche market opportunities, and sufficiently agile to take advantage of temporary market inefficiencies.  
By maintaining flexibility in our investment process, we can appropriately anticipate, react, and adapt to the dynamics of market developments. 
We look to deliver strong, risk-adjusted returns by emphasising quality, safety, and liquidity for our clients whilst focusing on capital preservation and the impact our capital is making on society and the environment.
Artesian's debt market investment process is implemented using a macro “top-down”, credit “bottom-up” approach with an ESG / Impact overlay.
Our investment process enables us to source, screen, rank, and analyse the optimal investment opportunities. The 6 key components of Artesian's investment process are:
 price discovery and data collection are critical tools in the investment process. Artesian gathers primary and secondary market information across global markets to inform relative value analysis. Combining our macro view with intelligence gained via our price discovery process, helps us identify parts of the debt capital structure that offer maximum value.
is used to select a priority list of opportunities for portfolio optimisation, new issues and secondary market transactions.
Artesian actively uses internal and external, quantitative and qualitative credit & impact analysis/research to optimise the portfolios risk, return and impact. 
 Artesian thoroughly analyses ESG risks to guide capital deployment and integrates this with overall relative value analysis.
Artesian maintains a series of readily observable risk guidelines when implementing the investment strategy. Artesian employs stress and scenario testing to assess market outcomes.
 Artesian employs model portfolio construction to provide a template for portfolio managers to follow. This instills a macro discipline above shorter-term investment decisions.
“It does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear”
Nassim Nicholas Taleb - "The Black Swan"
Artesian is a global, boutique debt specialist focused on relative value opportunities to produce absolute returns.
We identify niche opportunities in global debt markets & produce consistent alpha by leveraging our size/agility, experience & networks.
Returns take priority over asset gathering. Our strategies have inherent capacity constraints & we target optimal risk-adjusted returns.
We are committed to integrating ESG into our investment process with a focus on responsible & sustainable investment strategies.
Artesian employs 3 types of market analysis to identify and capitalise on opportunities across global debt markets:
Bottom-up credit analysis is undertaken by Artesian's credit analysis team. 
Potential investments are initially screened via a proprietary “credit grid”, which summarises key 
Bonds emerging from the credit analysis process that are deemed eligible for potential investment then undergo relative value analysis to determine optimal portfolio construction.
Artesian has developed proprietary relative value models to compare 
investment opportunities across variables such as duration, credit spread, rating, capital structure, liquidity and yield.
These models provide real time feeds to Artesian’s research analysts and portfolio managers to  identify,  evaluate and execute attractive relative value opportunities across global fixed income markets in order to achieve optimal portfolio performance.
Technical analysis is another critical tool for Artesian's active fixed income fund management style.
Our technical analysis complements our fundamental and relative value analysis, providing trend and timing overlays in global fixed income markets.  
The Fund invests in a diversified portfolio of liquid, predominately investment grade $AUD corporate bonds with greater emphasis on floating rate bonds to reduce interest rate risk.

The Fund’s mission is to displace the maximum amount of carbon (current and future) while ensuring capital protection and the highest rate of return possible. 
The dark green bond allocation addresses the resilience of existing infrastructure while the venture debt allocation addresses innovation that will circumvent obstacles to the roll out of the green economy.

In delivering female empowerment, corporations better reflect the demographic of the communities in which they operate, create an environment in which women can thrive, and gain material competitive advantages including:
ability to hire and retain the highest quality staff
providing greater personal and professional development
Corporations who adopt broad women empowerment policies tend to have higher margins, better return on assets, with more productive staff. For credit investing this reduces income volatility and dampens the tail-risk associated with potential defaults.
Artesian screens global bond markets and invests in the debt of corporations ranking best in class in their industry for facilitating female empowerment.
The Women Economic Empowerment Bond Fund invests in liquid debt securities of best in class corporates with progressive gender policies and governance. 
Artesian screens issuers to create a women’s economic empowerment value (WEEV), investing in the top decile for each sector / industry. Companies are assessed on a range of criteria including gender equality policies, female workforce participation, positions within the firm’s management structure and board representation. While employing a gender lens to filter the bond universe, Artesian provides investors an impact strategy without compromising on financial performance. 
Subsequent to calculating WEEV scores and selecting the best in class issuers, Artesian assesses the appropriate duration, convexity, credit spread, yield and credit risk for the prevailing market conditions. Portfolio construction involves continuous assessment of “best in class” issuers and relative value opportunities..
