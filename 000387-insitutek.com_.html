Bearing capacity is the capacity of soil to support the loads applied to the ground. The bearing capacity of soil is the maximum average contact pressure between the foundation and the soil which should not produce shear failure in the soil. Our innovative testing methods enables you to assess this in applications that include temporary works platforms for mobile crane pads or piling rigs, building and temporary structure foundations, tank farms, pavements and others.
Used to determine the allowable and ultimate bearing capacity
Suitable for pavement, foundation and temporary works platform investigation.
Immediate repeatable results so that on-site decisions can be made straight away
Estimate allowable and ultimate bearing capacity
Achieved by measuring deflection and changing plate diameters, drop weights and drop height.
Measures California Bearing Ratio (CBR) directly in the field
Evaluate the mechanical strength of subgrades and base courses

To obtain information on the physical properties of ground around a site to design earthworks and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress to earthworks and structures caused by subsurface conditions, you will need to do some site investigation. Our range of innovative site characterisation methods enables you to check the soil conditions, get immediate results and take samples.
PANDA® Instrumented Variable Energy Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP)
Immediate repeatable results so that on-site decisions can be made straight away
Good for testing in challenging conditions (remote, soft, marshy, over-water and hazardous locations or confined spaces)
GRIZZLY® Dynamic Probing Super Heavy (DPSH)
Used for ground investigation and estimating bearing capacity.
Also used for compaction control, geotechnical drilling and soil sampling (windowless sampling and Standard Penetration Test (SPT) split spoon sampling) for chemical and geotechnical analysis
Being light and compact, the GRIZZLY® is particularly good for testing in challenging conditions (difficult to access locations or confined spaces).
Portable method for evaluating soil strength
Immediate electronic data capture and results presentation so that on-site decisions can be made straight away
To complement our physical penetration tests, we use 
geophysical tests to map some geological features e.g. Basalt Rock Layers and the Ground Water Table Level. Typically we use Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and provide easy to read reports summarising all key findings and anomalies.

You need to ensure asphalt pavement is laid to specification. Our methods help you do this non destructively and ensure:
asphalt thickness is known and the depth is uniform.

Bridge Deck and Structure Condition Assessment
We specialise in bridge deck and bridge structure condition assessment to understand deterioration and asphalt overlay thickness for profiling / milling and bridge load design. We also undertake structural scanning to detect and provide 3D maps of reinforcing steel in reinforced concrete for piers, pile caps, concrete beams, floor slabs, walls, etc.
Using ground penetrating radar and infrared cameras (infrared thermography), we are able to: 
Measure asphalt thickness (overall and layer depths) on the bridge deck prior to asphalt profiling / milling
Mark location of reinforcing steel and provide 3D models
Determine deterioration, degradation and spalling of concrete
Measure concrete cover to reinforcing steel
Understanding asphalt depth is a critical planning element prior to milling the surface with profiling machines. It’s important to understand where expansion joints are and understand how the asphalt thickness changes across the structure. Sometimes we see significant asphalt thickness variations on different sections of a bridge.
Our approach is all part of reducing the risk of cutting into the concrete structure and into the steel, during the pavement milling process. Not only would this damage the bridge deck but the profiling machine too. 
The benefits of our approach include:
No traffic control or lane closure is required, meaning traffic isn’t interrupted, highway workers aren’t exposed to safety hazards and costs are dramatically reduced.
No invasive destructive coring to calibrate
Calculates pavement layer depths to a high accuracy
If bridges are in close proximity, we maybe able to assess multiple bridges within the same project.
Our clients include government road authorities, private asset owners, airports, ports, civil contractors, civil engineering consultants and utility companies.
We provide easy to read reports summarising all key findings and anomalies. We also provide:
ASCII Files Compatible with other Software and Databases
How does our Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) work?
Our GPR system has antennas mounted on a moving vehicle. The antennas transmit short pulses of radio wave energy into the pavement. As the energy travels through the pavement structure, it creates a reflection when it hits different materials, such as asphalt to crushed rock. The strength of the reflections, and the time it takes to travel through the concrete can be used to calculate the thickness and other properties.
I have known the team at Insitutek for over ten years. Their professionalism, positivity and enthusiasm for their work is outstanding and I am pleased to recommend them.
We find the Insitutek team extremely helpful and their knowledge of the equipment and its capabilities is a great resource for our staff.
Insitutek is our partner overseas for our test equipment. Ask them for a presentation or training for our products. I am sure you will be satisfied. They are a reliable and very kindly partner.
