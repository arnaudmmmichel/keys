Absolutely beautiful garment. Very delicate piece but an absolute wardrobe staple. Washes well and holds shape - You won’t be disappointed.

I had long been looking for the perfect, timeless black coat and this is it. Heavy, thick and warm with deep pockets. I have lived in it since I purchased it. Love it. A forever piece.
                    — Melissa Haase (Point Cook, Australia)
I am in love with my new jeans. The cut and the quality of the denim is incredible, they are super comfortable to wear and can be dressed up or down. As always, the experience shopping in store at Arnsdorf was lovely - thank you!
Beautiful stunning dress, that is sure to impress! Its quality and authenticity is unmatched. It is my favourite dress in my wardrobe.
