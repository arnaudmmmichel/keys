All advocates have their driving quality tracked using an insurance-grade telematics app that tracks braking, cornering, speeding and phone distraction.
All advocates must maintain a high safe-driving score to receive their monthly incentive and avoid penalties.
All vehicles have a GPS installed into their vehicle to guarantee visibility on vehicle activity.
Campaigns are independently measured through the funnel to an ROI level, and impressions are guaranteed.

Make up to $600 a month, driving as normal.
Promote brands you like, with a wrap on your vehicle.
We work with all vehicle types so we can find the perfect advocates for every brand. This means if you drive a hatchback, SUV, sedan, convertible, 4WD, ute, van, truck, electric vehicle, muscle car, classic car, or batmobile we want to hear from you.
Brands will sometimes want their Advocates to be involved in ad-hoc photoshoots or guerilla activations. In these instances, you will be notified in advance and be given the option to participate in return for $75 per hour.
Each campaign you’re accepted into will have specific monthly targets and which you should hit driving like you normally drive. Hitting these targets releases your income. If you have a month where you’re unable to meet your monthly target your income will be reduced, but don’t worry - you’re able to make it up in subsequent months.
We guarantee that there will be no damage caused to your vehicle during the installation or removal of your wrap and if there is we will arrange for the damage to be professionally repaired at our cost.

We’re here to pioneer a new way of advertising, where brands, people and the environment all benefit.
For all other enquiries please reach out to us at:
The ad economy is a biggie, and we think it would be nice to share it around a bit. We’re a little startup with some big aspirations, and we want everyone on the journey with us to benefit. Most Wrappr advocates earn $500 per month, equal to a 9% pay rise for the average Australian.
We’ve built Wrappr to ensure that brands can genuinely connect with their audience and cut through the noise. When 84% of advertising isn’t noticed or remembered, we deliver a surprising and unique format that makes a significant, measurable impact.
Wrappr is committed to being a net positive for the environment. This commitment means there is no hiding behind fluffy statements or virtue signals - we’re either making the environment better or we’re not. Our startup is one that naturally treads lightly by using existing resources and requiring advocates to only drive their normal routine, but on top of this, we also have a number of programs in place.
Through reforestation projects conducted and accredited through Greenfleet, we offset the carbon emissions for two vehicles for every advocate we have on the road, meaning the more advocates we have on the road, the more carbon emissions are drawn down.
To make EV ownership more attractive and accelerate the adoption of EVs, we offer an additional $100 per month to any advocate who drives an EV, meaning they make up to $600 per month driving as normal.
We’re currently working on a solution to develop the first car wrap recycling service in Australia. Watch this space.
At Wrappr, our aspirations have always been to build a company where everyone can get the most out of life, both professionally and personally.
This means that we have been a remote-first company since day one, and Wrappr staff can be found working from home, in our offices in Sydney and Melbourne, or from a campervan down the coast.
We think long-term, aim high, and love pioneering new ways for brands, advocates and the environment to all benefit.
