We've selected some special soft toys that are made from organic cotton and safe materials, or that are hand knitted!  Eco friendly soft toys are more than just cuddly companions, they are gentle on your child’s skin and the environment. Plush toys are usually made from synthetic materials like nylon, with bright colours, and often you can smell the chemicals off-gassing.  But, organic soft toys are natural, soothing, and less irritating. Browse our collection of soft toys today and find the perfect one for your child or yourself.
