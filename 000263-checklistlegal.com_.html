"Verity was fabulous. She really understands the needs of small business, she listened to my specific concerns, and she wrote a contract that fit the brief, made sense (hallelujah!), and was delivered to me on time."
"I love how you make legals for small business owners fun and accessible." 
"We approached Verity because we knew that what she would create would reflect who we were as a company. She took a boring document & made it delightful -  exactly what we wanted to achieve!"
"Verity is amazing at getting to the heart of the matter, simplifying legal terms and making it easier for legal documents to be understood by all."
"I came to Verity because I'd just updated all my services and I had no terms of services for them. I wasn't sure how to get started to write them myself. Plus, I wanted to make sure that they were lawful!"

"The Sharesies legal team considers Verity a valuable asset and regularly taps into her expertise for legal contract design advice and more. Verity has been involved in document automation for consent to use personal information and has facilitated legal quarterly review meetings."
"Verity was always prompt, professional and enjoyable to work with in bringing my contracts, T&Cs etc into currency.  Something that I felt was a labour, was made into something easy to manage.  Thank you.  We'll do it all again periodically to make sure all's well and good in legal land."
"Verity is a contracts goddess and I love her passion for something I’d previously consider as a boring part thing to work on in your business — little did I know I just needed some Verity spice to explain it to me in a different way. As someone who loves an on brand experience, I loved finding out that my contracts could be on brand and ensure my business was safe-guarded and acted as a solid boundary."
"Verity and the Checklist Legal team made creating and reviewing Good4Business's legal documents fun and easy. The process was straightforward, and I felt confident that all aspects of my business were addressed professionally and using Good4Business's brand voice and identity. I highly recommend Verity and the Checklist Legal team for creating legal documents that make sense."

You know how contracts are boring and stressful to read, understand, use, and create?
We call this Human Centred Contract Operations
Contract Operations is a delicious and interwoven mix of different business and legal concepts.

Understanding the law is one thing. Drafting the legal positions that balance your own business needs and risk thresholds, as well as what your clients or suppliers expect is another thing altogether. We love working to develop a relational approach to contracts and that starts with a solid understanding of the legal strategy.
Includes: Legal research, Legal design, solution finding, risk assessment, values-based contracting, and more!
Contracts aren't just bits of paper with slabs of text. From video contracts to infographic explainers, from comic book contracts to drafting in your brand voice, there are new and exciting ways to craft incredible contracts. Create the right structure and format for your contract, based on your business and your clients' needs. Design contract information that's readable, understandable, and engaging.
Includes: Plain language, Information Design, Visual Contracting, Contract Design Patterns, Graphic Design, and more!
Contracts have many different users. From the people who draft them, the people who review them, the people who sign up to them, the people who negotiate them, and those who try to actually deliver products or services under them, there can be a lot of cooks in the kitchen. Taking users into account when you are crafting contracts (from all levels of legal content, contract format, and contract process) can stop problems from occurring and minimise them if issues do crop up.
Includes: User testing, user research, split testing, surveys, design workshops, change management, and more!
A business without clear processes will have grumpy team members, frustrated clients, and slow, clunky systems. Contracts don't just magically appear (despite what legal tech companies might have you believe!), they are created and stored and varied generally with good intentions. It's up to us to find the core "why" behind each step in the process and optimise the flow for business outcomes and happy clients.
Includes: Process mapping, document assembly, contract lifecycle management, legal project management, data flow diagrams, approval thresholds, and more!

Create a powerful plan to solve the real cause of identified issues
If you have an idea of the issue you need to tackle, but you’re not sure what to prioritise or how to build a business case, it can be a very confusing area with lots of different software vendors and consultants clamouring for your attention (and wallet!).
Perhaps you just want an experienced innovator to help make your project a true, measurable success.
We can develop a powerful program that priroritises solving your unique issues and delivers the outcomes we co-create.
Our engaging contract operations workshops can get you set up for DIY success, help prioritise problems, and create a tangible plan to solve your top issues, and all with fixed price certainty.
Contract Operations and Legal Design Overview
Do you often feel like you keep banging on about innovation but can’t seem to get cut through? If you or your team feel lost when it comes to innovation, automation, electronic signatures, smart contracts, visual legal information, contract design, and all things legal tech, we can help!
With a series of primers on human centred design and legal innovation, we can ignite a fire under your team and gather valuable insights and buy in from stakeholders.
You know there is an issue with your contracts… clients are grumbling, the sign up process is slow… and internally you want to close more deals and faster.
Time for a speedy audit of your contract and some laser focused ideas for improvements. We check for potential commercial issues (especially unfair contract terms), assess readability, provide a basic client journey map, and give you a plan of attack for improvements, based on your specific business requirements.
(We might be biassed but this is one of our fave options for planning a business revamp!)
You have the idea, you just want some expertise on how to plan it out and map the details. Enter Verity… our award winning innovator. After planning and executing countless legal ops and contract design projects, Verity has a few tricks up her (often sequin-y) sleeves. Whether you are planning to roll out new tech, redesigning a business-critical contract, trying to pick a service provider, or overwhelmed and not sure where to start… Verity will help get you on the right track with a roadmap for success.
Add visible value and do it efficiently!
There are new laws coming in, a big rebrand underway, or perhaps customer issues (complaints, refunds, questions, long negotiations, slow sales process… the usual frustrations!)...
It’s time to step up your client experience and add value. It’s time for you to take a leadership position within your industry and sales or procurement process.
Legal Project Management can be overwhelming when you are also trying to keep up with the day-to-day hustle and grind.
Wouldn’t it be lovely if there was an experienced legal designer, ready to take your business problems and innovation ideas and bring them to life? Skip past the hard part of keeping a project on track, creating workshops, and gathering insights from stakeholders. Get to the good part faster.

Contract Operations and Legal Design Overview
Do you often feel like you keep banging on about innovation but can’t seem to get cut through? If you or your team feel lost when it comes to innovation, automation, electronic signatures, smart contracts, visual legal information, contract design, and all things legal tech, we can help!
With a series of primers on human centred design and legal innovation, we can ignite a fire under your team and gather valuable insights and buy in from stakeholders.
You know there is an issue with your contracts… clients are grumbling, the sign up process is slow… and internally you want to close more deals and faster.
Time for a speedy audit of your contract and some laser focused ideas for improvements. We check for potential commercial issues (especially unfair contract terms), assess readability, provide a basic client journey map, and give you a plan of attack for improvements, based on your specific business requirements.
(We might be biassed but this is one of our fave options for planning a business revamp!)
You have the idea, you just want some expertise on how to plan it out and map the details. Enter Verity… our award winning innovator. After planning and executing countless legal ops and contract design projects, Verity has a few tricks up her (often sequin-y) sleeves. Whether you are planning to roll out new tech, redesigning a business-critical contract, trying to pick a service provider, or overwhelmed and not sure where to start… Verity will help get you on the right track with a roadmap for success.
Add visible value and do it efficiently!
There are new laws coming in, a big rebrand underway, or perhaps customer issues (complaints, refunds, questions, long negotiations, slow sales process… the usual frustrations!)...
It’s time to step up your client experience and add value. It’s time for you to take a leadership position within your industry and sales or procurement process.
Legal Project Management can be overwhelming when you are also trying to keep up with the day-to-day hustle and grind.
Wouldn’t it be lovely if there was an experienced legal designer, ready to take your business problems and innovation ideas and bring them to life? Skip past the hard part of keeping a project on track, creating workshops, and gathering insights from stakeholders. Get to the good part faster.

And I’m ready to help energise your event and keep your audience engaged
I’m Verity, a commercial lawyer turned legal innovation expert with a passion for redesigning legal documents, contracts and processes to be easy to read, easy to use and jargon-free. Oh, and I make a delightful Margarita cocktail, too.
After 10+ years in corporate law land, I saw a problem. Too many business owners and lawyers were held back by confusing contracts and clunky legal processes. So, I founded Checklist Legal to put my love for problem solving and fixing things to good use.
Now, I’m a multi-award winning lawyer and legal innovator sharing my love for clear, clever contracts with businesses and leaders across the country.
When I’m not revolutionising the legal industry, you’ll find me going all-out for a themed costume party, walking my very cute Cavalier, Brinkley, watching musicals (I once spent $500 to see Hamilton in NYC #noregrets) or relaxing with my go-to cocktail, a Margarita.
Verity is a Law Institute of Victoria Accredited Specialist in Commercial Law.
Verity is a Certified Practitioner of Human-Centered Design by the LUMA Institute.
In 2021, Verity was named Corporate Lawyer of the Year at the Australian Corporate Lawyer Awards.

Is your business in need of a Legal Check Up? | We fix Contracts! — Checklist Legal
Just like a health check-up with a doctor, you and your business need regular legal check-ups to keep across any early signs of current or potential legal issues.
When you have a legal check-up, a lawyer or other trained professional talks with you about your current business structure, people involved in the business, current business model, and your strategy moving forward, as well as anything that’s keeping you up at night!
Whilst an accountant or bookkeeper can give you some insights into financial compliance, they aren’t legally trained and so aren’t able to give a clear picture of all legal obligations of you and your business.
The best kind of legal health check is tailored specifically to your business and your industry. And they should be a relaxed and relatively enjoyable experience with someone that you trust.
What happens during your Legal Check Up
Step 1 - Book in the check up
Find a time that suits you to have a cuppa and a chat with a friendly Checklist Legal Lawyer
Pay your deposit to book the time in and get access to our Legal Check Up Checklist and other resources.
Step 2 - Check in with our friendly business savvy lawyers
We chat with you about your business and run through core areas as well as your questions.
Relax and enjoy talking about your business and getting a plan in place.
Step 3 - Your checklist for action
 We get back to you with a tailored checklist for your business and an action plan for future milestones.
We’ll also send you our remaining invoice for payment.
Huzzah! 💃🏽🎉 Your check up is complete and you have a plan of attack for your next business steps and feel confident moving forward.
There are lots of reasons it can be helpful to get a legal check up
Confirm whether your current strategy and model are in line with good industry practice and compliance requirements
Find out whether any recent updates in the law affect you and your business
Understand your obligations as your business grows and changes
Plan ahead to match your business compliance as you gow
Ensure you as a business director and manager understand the risks and potential personal liability you have
Hear about trends across other businesses
Avoid wasting time with your own “google lawyering”
Reduce risks in the way you operate as a business
Plan ahead for your business when you reach new milestones such as changing business structure, hiring employees, or firing a contractor
How often do I need a legal check up?
Generally, a once a year check-up is a great idea if you have a lawyer you know and trust to help. 
If you or your business are going through a large change (for example, changing business structure, taking on an employee, getting married), it can also be a good time to do a general check up to make sure all your ducks are in a row.
Who can help with a legal check up?
Whilst a commercial lawyer is great for a general review of legal issues for business and corporate governance, there are different specialists that you might need to help with a legal check up (similar to different medical specialists). Experts in employment law, start-up law, consumer issues, dispute resolution etc can be useful to dive deeper into problems or questions.
We can help, book in a chat below
    Book a chat with Checklist Legal
Every Legal Check Up is tailored for each business and business owner, however the core areas we cover are:
A structural check looks at the different legal business structures available and assesses which structure will help to minimise your own personal liability as well as some basic tax issues from different structures. 
We’ll give you some guidelines on the different structures and a plan to consider when you might want to change business structures going to restructure your business. 
✓   How is your business structured?
The all important admin, can’t forget these all important areas.
Protecting your IP properly is critical to ensure you can get the most value out of all the work you do in your business.
Getting your registrations in place, the right insurance, and protecting your IP are all key admin checks you need to feel confident you have a functional business without hidden issues beneath the surface.
✓   Insurance [ Public / Product / Professional Indemnity / Cyber ] 
✓   Trademarks and other IP protection
Revenue generating contracts are the heart of any business and we love looking at how your different revenue generating products and services are sold.
We can give you an overview on different industry risks and requirements.
For example, a company selling sunscreen has different legal requirements than a company selling software. We tailor our check up to cover issues in your industry and your business model.
You might have started out doing everything yourself, but as you grow and hire you can end up with a tangle of contractors and employees, as well as other suppliers, that could be causing you future problems.
There are some important issues around employees and independent contractors you need to be aware of so you don’t accidentally slip into sham contracting or other missteps with your team.
Even though it is called ‘consumer’ law, the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) also applies to small businesses.
The ACL covers a range of consumer and small business protection issues, including:
• Unfair contract terms (big changes in this area for 2023!!)
• Misleading or deceptive conduct (this is a very big area and covers advertising all the way to business dealings)
• Consumer guarantees (such as the right to a repair, replacement or refund for goods that are faulty or not fit for purpose)
• Unsolicited consumer agreements (such as door-to-door sales or telemarketing)
• The ACL applies to all businesses that supply goods or services to consumers and small businesses… so you need to be across how the laws affect your business.
What happens after a Legal Check Up?
Once you have your trusty Checklist Legal plan of attack for your business, you can either start implementing the action plan yourself or work with your advisors to help you roll out the details,
We know that you need to prioritise your business spending, and that’s why we rank the key issues and help you develop a roadmap for managing them.
For example, if you want to develop a new subcontractor business model to help grow your business, then you might want to update your contractor agreement, your client agreement, and give your privacy policy a once over.
We’ll help you decide on a prioritised approach so you can feel confident in the new model without taking huge risks.
Let’s get your Legal Check Up booked in!
A Legal Check Up can be very useful for businesses that have not had a chance to assess what they need to meet legal best practice. It can also be useful to identify what your business needs in the future when it grows or hits other key milestones.
A Legal Check Up should provide you with an assessment of where your business is at and what you need to do to meet legal practice. It should also cover basic areas for businesses including business structuring, protecting your intellectual property, business contracts, and hiring staff.

            Can you copy terms and conditions for your business from another website?
It may be tempting to just copy and paste privacy policies or terms and conditions from a similar business’ website but apart from it being a breach of copyright, you may be missing important legal information that is unique to your business, industry, state or country.
Read more about this in our Blawg post: 
“Can you copy terms and conditions for your business from another website”
            Can I buy a template online and DIY my legal documents?
Yes, there is no rule that says all business documents must be drafted by a lawyer. But legal agreements aren’t a one size fits all document. To make sure you have legally binding documents that are suited to your business and industry, we suggest getting direction from a trained expert or legal advisor. 
Why not book a chat with us to see what documents you may need for your business?
