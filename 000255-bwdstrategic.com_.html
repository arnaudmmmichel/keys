About us • BWD Strategic • Experts in sustainability
          Who we are and what motivates us.
              Partnering with business to shape a better future. 
              BWD is an independent sustainability consultancy and B Corp focused on delivering a sustainability approach that supports corporate strategy, navigates change, and contributes to a flourishing society and planet.
              BWD started with an entrepreneurial woman migrant who founded a reporting consultancy 33 years ago. Executive Chair Derryn Heilbuth shares her insight into growing the business to what it is today.  
              Getting ready for the next episode.
In late 2022, we realised that the brand no longer reflected the business. CEO Luke Heilbuth reflects on where we've come from, what we've become and what we hope to be.

We take risks to be trailblazers, do the hard work required to be leaders and  win awards for our clients.
We want to be the best place to work on ESG, live our values, shun hypocrisy, and believe we'll make a difference in the world.
We use creativity to solve big problems, never settle for cookie cutter solutions and always ask: how can we do this better?
We make the complex simple, impact influential businesses and are leaders in what we do.
              Our impact is created through the partnerships we foster, the initiatives we support and the standards to which we adhere.
As systems thinkers, we understand that every business has an obligation bigger than itself.
"Vision without systems thinking ends up painting lovely pictures of the future with no deep understanding of the forces that must be mastered to move from here to there."

Future-proofing an Asian energy giant • BWD Strategic
BWD has provided strategic support to one of the largest utilities in the Asia-Pacific since 2017, after the utility chose to partner with us to gain a deeper understanding of how environmental, social, geopolitical and technological changes in its operating environment were impacting enterprise strategy and prospects for success.
We have since undertaken four materiality assessments on behalf of the energy giant to help identify and prioritize the sustainability issues most important to the business and its stakeholders. In 2021, the Group became one of the first companies globally to adopt double materiality.
The outcome of our long-standing partnership has been the full integration of sustainability considerations into enterprise strategy and the integrated reporting suite. The Group is considered a global leader in sustainability strategy and disclosure, as evidenced by best practice citations from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and receipt of the best materiality reporting award (large cap) in China for three years running.
