Compact and super efficient, the eWater Standalone System is economical to buy and easy to install. This wall-mounted, single-outlet unit can be easily installed into new sites or retrofitted into existing sites. 
Standalone Systems produce cleaning and sanitising solution with safe, sustainable and effective water electrolysis technology.
Ideally suited for kitchens, cleaning closets and other operational environments where a quick and easy on-demand production system will fit into workflow.
"...a much safer environment for staff"
A focus on sustainable outcomes led the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) and their FM partner Biniris to make the move to eWater as they reduce the use of packaged chemicals across their campus.
First commissioned in late 2016, eWater was integrated into USC’s active program of sustainability initiatives that aims to address both large-scale issues such as energy, waste, recycling and the campus environment. With a commitment to students, staff and the wider community in mind, the opportunity to reduce their reliance and use of synthetic packaged chemicals represented an initiative that ticked all boxes. 
Matt Stone, ex-Executive Chef at Oakridge Estate
uses eWater in all his kitchens to support a non-toxic chemical environment. 
Matt Stone who was awarded the Gourmet Traveller’s prestigious Best New Talent Award in 2011 has been a vocal advocate of sustainable dining and has continued this philosophy at the restaurant at Oakridge Winery.
eWater Reticulated Systems are ideal for large-scale operations such as food production facilities, fish wholesalers, processing kitchens, restaurants and production kitchens of all sizes.
With central tanks supplying a network of taps and wash stations, eWater Reticulated Systems are custom-designed to meet the individual needs of the most challenging environments.
"I didn't think it could possibly work..."
The rebuild of the iconic Stokehouse in St Kilda is the first 5-star Greenstar restaurant in Australia. An eWater Reticulated   System has been installed to complete the package of green technologies.
Owner Frank van Haandel said that "I'm really excited that the Chefs love it...they have told me that it's better than what they could have ever anticipated", and Group Kitchen Manager Ben Pigott remarked that "it actually works better than regular chemicals... based on that alone I would recommend it".
The Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC) has a strong emphasis on sustainability and progressive environmental practices.
An eWater Reticulated  System plays an integral role within that philosophy.
MCEC was the first centre in the world to be awarded a 6-Star Green Star environment rating by the Green Building Council of Australia for the Convention Centre’s innovative environmental design and operational features. In addition to this, MCEC also achieved the Gold EarthCheck Certification in 2016, following five years of continuous Silver accreditation, benchmarking their sustainability initiatives.
We also carry a selected range of high quality consumable items specifically for use with our eWater Systems including specially graded eWater electrolyser salt, eWater cleaning and eWater sanitising spray bottles, eWater test strips, and eWater microfibre cloths as well as other parts and accessories.

meta title:How eWater Works | eWater Systems
meta description:eWater Hygiene Systems utilise water electrolysis technology to produce 
effective, non-toxic and sustainable cleaning and sanitising solution. 
Designed into your business with an on demand productions system, eWater 
helps cut out waste and replace harsh chemicals with an alternative that is 
sensitive to humans and the environment.

How eWater Works | eWater Systems
The technology works by passing a dilute salt solution through an electrolyser that segregates the ions formed, producing oppositely charged solutions with altered physical and chemical properties. 
Our ingredient list has nothing to hide
These solutions are produced by an onsite and on-demand system and can be used for a variety of applications. The activated solutions are both naturally bio-degradable and revert to NaCI and H2O after extended contact with organic material.
Four versatile solutions for all areas of hygiene
The eWater Hygiene System produces four distinct hygiene solutions that will replace the majority of chemicals used in your organisation. 
A commercial grade disinfectant proven to kill Coronaviruses including COVID-19. Use on all hard surfaces. 
A pH neutral, sanitising cleaner that is ideal for getting rid of odours, cleaning floors, bathrooms and other hard surfaces where ensuring a sanitary and clean environment is crucial.
An effective, quick contact anti-bacterial sanitiser for surfaces, hands and food contact applications.   
A multi-purpose cleaning agent that cuts through dirt, grease and grime. Leaving no residue, it is ideal for use on all surfaces, including stainless, glass, floors and equipment. Food safe for produce wash.
A proven solution for hygiene management
Not only is eWater far more sustainable and cheaper, but in almost all cases eWater is far more effective at quickly killing bacteria and microbial elements than harmful chemicals such as bleach.
Doug MacFarlane, Sir John Monash Distinguished Professor at Monash University's School of Chemistry is a recognised expert in ionic chemistry and shares his view of the efficacy of eWater for hygiene management as a replacement to conventional chemicals.
eWater is accredited for your assurance
eWater Disinfectant is a commercial grade hard surface disinfectant that passes the TGA Option C disinfectant efficacy test. Effective against a wide range of microbial. 
eWater holds a wide range of accreditations including HACCP for food safety.
All eWater solutions are Organic Certified.
