 I rented this dress for my bridal shower and it was gorgeous! The dress came earlier than expected which allowed me more time to try it on. I loved it!
I rented this last month for the races and I absolutely loved it. It was my backup but I HAD to wear it. Iâm in between a 12&14 so decided to roll with a 14.
GlamCorner is amazing and has changed the way I shop for good! No longer do I buy an expensive outfit and where it once. Instead, I just rent it.
This dress was so beautiful and exceeded my expectations! The detailing of the dress is so pretty and it made me feel so elegant whilst also being so comfortable.
True to size. In great condition. Lovely easy to wear dress. More âshinyâ than I expected though.
Baby What's Your Sign - White Zodiac Print
Wore over tights on a cold winter's night. Adorable frilly skirt with super comfy elastic waistband. fit was good.
I loved this outfit. Very comfortable, standout work piece that I wore to facilitate a big office wide workshop. I got a zillion compliments and felt very good and confident in it. It moves well and is not too tight - very corporate office appropriate, but could equally be worn for an event :)
Super flattering, very comfortable, no iron dress. Wore it to work multiple times and felt extremely comfortable all day. Got many compliments. LOVE IT
Watercolour Animal Dress - Blue Multi
Wore this to a black tie charity ball and felt very glam. Ideally I needed a 12 as the 14 was a little big but not so much that I couldn't wear it. I received many compliments and I felt good despite having put on some weight in the past year. Easy process as always. Thanks.
Funky dress with fun cuff detail. The fabric of this dress is a smooth silky feel (but has no give) which was a pleasant surprise as I thought it was going to be more of a jersey fabric. I felt super comfortable in this dress and wore it to dinner with girlfriends with black boots.
Baby What's Your Sign - White Zodiac Print
Gorgeous dress for a day at the Polo
Loved the dress for a day time Polo event. It looked gorgeous on and I got so many compliments. I ordered an 8, but the tag said small and definitely felt it was a generous 8. It was quite big around the top for me, as I am a small chested, but I made do. Otherwise, it was perfect.
Loved the skirt and top set, the black looking detailing in pics was actually light pastel blue and had a glitter thread through it but still looked really nice and shirt looked great with black long sleeve crop regardless of blue through it. Crop wasnât very supportive so if youâre above a C cup you may have some trouble staying covered without the sleeves up on your shoulders
 Alex Tweed Top And Sally Tweed Skirt Set
I rented this suit for a Monogram (single colour) party. I would never have bought something like this previously, but I loved this suit. Since wearing it I may try to find more matching sets. This outfit was so much fun!
River Blazer And Pant Set - Orchid
I rented this dress for a ball and it looked great. I got so many compliments from random people. The dress sparkles and is very eye catching and flattering especially at night. The fit was perfect and the dress is comfortable to wear. This was my backup dress but looked much better than the dress I was originally going to wear. Would definitely recommend it and I would rent it again.
BADGLEY MISCHKA Sequin Cowl Back Gown - Gold
BADGLEY MISCHKA Sequin Cowl Back Gown - Gold
I rented this beautiful headpiece for a ladies day at the races and got so many compliments. Receiving and returning the rental was so easy.
I rented this for a highschool formal, my measurements were a bit larger than the size I got but it fit me perfectly. The only issue was people stepping on the back of the dress, but this was solved pretty easily and although the dress is a little restrictive, overall very comfortable.
First time renting a dress and it was a great experience! Dress fit well with the option to order a backup for a small cost. I live out west and the dress turned up a day earlier than expected and fit perfectly. This dress was beautiful and I received many compliments throughout the night :)
Deep V Plunge Dress - Wine
Great dress for a formal wedding. True to size and well fitting. Great quality fabric. Received so many positive comments. The trail on the dress was so beautiful and elegant.
Great for summer with big splash of colour.
Great for weekend, beach or getaway. I am a 8/10 and ordered 8. Fit well with generous room at the bottom. Received a lot of compliments, will wear this again.
I rented this weekend last weekend for a black tie wedding and it was absolutely amazing! Iâd never rented a dress before but it was perfect. Wear high heels with this dress as its floor length.

Why can't I sign up to Starter or Unlimited Plan anymore?
As our customer base grew we were determined to make sure that growth didn't impact our ability to have the right products for all of our customers. So; we asked our members a whole host of questions and then built these plans based on their feedback. The starter and unlimited plans weren't specific to each customer, and therefore didn't allow us to proactively plan for each customer's needs. The new pricing plans enable us to manage our stock levels to make sure we have the items you want, when you want them.
What if I'm an existing Starter or Unlimited Customer?
There are no changes for you. The Starter and Unlimited Plan features and your access to Membership Collection will remain the same.
However, new features will only be available on the newer (Lite/Premium/Ultimate) plans as they are rolled out.

I really enjoyed wearing this dress it was very flattering and the colours are bright and fun! I am between an 8 and 10 and the 10 was perfect. It can be adjusted with the belt easily 
Another great dress for my Fiji holiday. 
Very pretty dress with multiple ways to tie, I created a halter neck and hid the back straps. It has seams crossing at the mid thigh which makes it more column than flared like I thought it would be but still looked well. It has a light cotton lining to the knee which also adds a bit more volume at the hips like others have said. 
Very flattering and eye catching dress, perfect for my Fiji holiday. I usually donât wear things that have to be tied at the back because I have to wear a strapless bra but I found a way to tie it over the back clasp so it was a more seamless look. Beautiful dress, felt really pretty in it and got lots of compliments from my husband! 
Beautiful light weight linen like material was perfect for a Hens Day in the wineries, very comfortable, fit is true to size. 
Loved this dress and the fact that it had pockets! Was a great party dress and great quality. 
Super cute top. Quite sheer so you need something under it. Wore to work and then changed to wearing it tucked into black jeans and it was cute. Versatile and comfortable. 
Loved this jumpsuit! It was flattering, comfortable and stylish. Loads of compliments and would definitely wear again. 
Beautiful, vibrant pink! I wore it with a belt to give it a bit of shape. Lots of compliments and loved wearing this dress. Would rent again. 
I rented this for a Havana themed social event. I loved the fit and feel - it was comfy, great colour and a great cut. Highly recommend. 
This material creases easily and the top requires boob tape as you can easily see nipples as it gapes. I wore a size 10 and will size down next time I imagine you could go one or two sizes down. The fabric wasnât as nice as I imagined. I received compliments on the outfit though. 
Loved these pants the silk material was gorgeous. I needed to steam iron the creases in it though for a bit. They say theyâre pajamas but I wore them out! 
I've rented these twice now to wear to work in the cooler months, and they are always a hit! Such a fun colour but not too over the top, and the slit at the back is a very fun touch. Got loads of compliments, and the fit is incredibly comfortable. 
This shirt is really nice, it looks exactly like it does in the photos. Fits really nicely and a good material. The print was a bit too busy for my taste, and I didn't love the way it hangs at the neckline/chest area. 
Does GlamCorner have a physical shop?
We are solely based online so we don't have a retail store to try dresses on. Here at GlamCorner we offer a fit guarantee to ensure you have something perfect to wear for your upcoming event. 
, we recommend placing a Rental order using our Back Up Dress system, which means for an additional $15 you receive a second dress and you can wear whichever one you prefer for your event. This is a great option if you are unsure of sizing or if you are tossing up between two styles. 
If neither dress is the perfect fit or youâre just not happy with it - simply send your dress back with all tags fully intact, and weâll either send out a different size for free or give you a 
How do I return my dress?
To return your dress, please pop it into the return satchel included in your original order box. Then, please take it to either a yellow Australia Post express postal box, or to an Australia Post outlet.
Returns can be posted from anywhere in Australia and you do not need to return from the same area that you received the order. 
The order will arrive on the first day of your rental period and we ask that you please post the order back on the last day. We take postage times into consideration when expecting the parcel back at our warehouse.
 We take care of all dry cleaning, so you are welcome to simply pop the style into the satchel after wearing it.
Our team will notify you when we receive the order back at our warehouse.
What if my rental period ends on a Sunday or a public holiday?
We can confirm if your final day of rental falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a public holiday, please return your order to the nearest yellow express post box by 5 pm.
If there isn't a yellow express postal box close by, or the parcel doesn't fit, then you may hold onto the items and return to an Australia Post outlet by 3pm next business day. 
What if I accidentally stain or damage the dress?
We understand that some wear and tear may be inevitable, and as such we provide free $100 accidental damage insurance to cover these types of accidents. Please contact us if youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve accidentally stained or damaged the dress. 
What if Iâd like to get my rental today?
We offer same-day delivery in Sydney Metro area (within 20km of Sydney CBD) - from 9:00am to 3:00pm (Sydney time) Monday through Friday. 
How does the 'Backup Dress' work?
If you're unsure about the dress size or fit, or simply want to try another style, you can add your booking a 'backup dress' for $15. Simply select the "Add Backup Dress" option before checkout, and select your backup dress from our collection.
A few details to keep in mind when selecting your backup dress:
Your 'backup dress' can be any dress - a different size of the same dress, or a completely different style. It's up to you.
Please make sure the 'delivery date' of your backup dress is the same as your primary dress.
When you add a backup dress to your cart, the lower priced dress will automatically discount to $15.
Kindly be reminded that including a Backup Dress in your order does not entitle you to wear both of them to an event. One of your dresses is required to be returned with its tag still intact and if not, it will be considered worn and you will be charged the full rental price of the Backup Dress (less the $15 you have already paid for it).
Do you have any questions about One Time Rental?
You can contact us by email at hello@glamcorner.com.au or live chat! Our office hours are
