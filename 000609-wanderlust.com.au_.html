Liquid herbal extracts for a busy world. Rapidly absorbed, 100% plant origin, nothing artificial and vegan friendly.
Check out our Vitamin & Supplement Range today.
Harnessing the best nature has to offer to deliver products of the highest Australian-made quality. We’re proud to be among the few to offer plant-active, 100% vegan formulas, with minimal excipients.
We believe creating vegan-friendly products is essential to our goal of setting a cleaner benchmark within the supplement industry. By avoiding animal-derived ingredients entirely, as well as synthetic ingredients, we uphold our own ethical and sustainability values, while delivering products people can trust.
Committed to supporting you with plant-active supplements and wholefoods, our range strives to harness the best from nature. Dedicated to sourcing quality ingredients from around the world, we select certified organic ingredients wherever possible, avoid synthetic ingredients and excipients, and consciously create with intelligence and integrity.
Being Australian made is important to us. The high quality and breadth of natural ingredients available in Australia is second to none. But, it’s also about our own company values and identity. To create meaningful social and environmental impact, we believe we need to act locally, first and foremost.
Our packaging is proudly made from fully-recyclable cartons and amber glass jars. We are currently working hard to source planet-friendly solutions for the induction seals, sachets and desiccants. We’ll keep exploring more sustainable ways to keep our packaging out of landfill and protect our precious natural resources.
Our supplements are one hundred percent plant derived. It’s part of our commitment to not only producing clean products, but green ones too. Dairy production is, for the most part, environmentally destructive contributing to land clearing, water pollution and climate change. Being dairy-free aligns with our company values.
