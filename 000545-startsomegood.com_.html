I found The Good Hustle to be inspiring and a very supportive group and platform to think about all the possibilities for my ideas and project to work towards a successful outcome. The team has been honest and very informative in a journey towards taking a good idea to become a commercially viable business.
I've worked with a lot of crowdfunding platforms but StartSomeGood were absolutely the best. I was blown away.
If you’ve been sitting on an idea for a while, unsure whether or how to progress it, I cannot recommend this program highly enough!! As a result, I have made some MAJOR decisions and am currently in the process of completely redesigning my life and work, which will hopefully shoot me onto a new trajectory.

The StartSomeGood Network is an inclusive community for those committed to changing the world through entrepreneurship. We created the the StartSomeGood Network for anyone working to change the status quo for the better.
Innovation and change requires new thinking, intense commitment and a whole lot of courage. All of these things are fostered by being in community with and learning from those also on this journey.
Together, we can learn more, do more, be more resilient and make a bigger impact on the challenges and opportunities of our age. We want to help you clarify your purpose, sharpen your skills, build your networks, share your story, and make a bigger impact!
A founder who would love the insights, camaraderie, and support of people like you
Still refining your ideas and preparing your plans to launch something new
Working inside an existing organisation trying to push it in a direction of greater innovation
In the trenches of an impact business, delivering value to customers and community every day, but aspiring to grow and do more
Making an impact as a volunteer or pro bono but you want to do impact work full time and make it sustainable
A student studying or simply passionate about social entrepreneurship
A budding entrepreneur looking for advice and inspiration
Then the StartSomeGood Network is designed for you.
A community-based peer learning platform where we connect, share, and grow together
The chance to meet new collaborators, partners, mentors and friends
Access to our content library with over 140 interviews with successful Social Entrepreneurial Founders, growing monthly
Up to Four exclusive live Webinar Sessions + Q&As with leading social entrepreneurs each month, so we can learn from those who have gone before
A monthly mastermind session where you will be able to explore your own enterprise challenges and get feedback
Discounted access to all StartSomeGood courses and services, including “early-bird anytime” pricing for our Good Hustle social enterprise design course and crowdfunding courses and support
Other exclusive discounts and opportunities relevant for social entrepreneurs - including discounts on books, events, online courses and more
This is for the future makers
The StartSomeGood Network is designed for those who are creating something new, helping those less fortunate and inspiring a community to embrace your vision of change.
Individually, it’s easy to feel isolated, overwhelmed and to burn out.
But when we share and learn together, we become stronger and smarter and more capable of creating the change we seek. The truth is, the journey of social entrepreneurship is challenging.
Creating something new can be a long, hard road. Not everyone will get it. Some might oppose it.
But if you are called to start something that matters it’s important to surround yourself with those who are also on this journey. That’s what this community is for.
Join for just $15 USD per month, or $99 USD per year. Students, the unwaged and those in the developing world can sign up for $60 USD for the first year, and $99 USD per year thereafter. We have a really exciting program of events and opportunities for next year - you can get a sneak peek of some of the upcoming guests below.
In total members will be invited to more than 40 exclusive learning events and networking opportunities during the year - less than $2/event for annual membership. Membership in the StartSomeGood Network would also make a great present or reward for a client, partner or friend, to support them on their journey as a changemaker, giving them access to a steady stream of inspiration and opportunities every month, and a community of peers who get it.
$60 USD for the first year
We create it. It's shaped by the actions we take and the decisions we make today. By the time the future becomes the present, it's too late. This present we now inhabit is the product of actions and decisions already taken, by us and by others.
The future is yet to be written. If there's something you don't like about the status quo, you can complain, you can say someone ought to do something about that… or you can start creating that better future. But you don’t have to do it alone.
Join our community and we can create that better future – together.
To make change in the long run, you need two key things
 Learning from those who have gone before you, learning from other stakeholders and beneficiaries, learning from peers. If you stop learning you stop innovating, which is death in a rapidly-changing world.
 Entrepreneurship is stressful. It is. We know.
You’ll fail and fall and need to pick yourself up. But it can be hard to reveal our fears when you’re leading a team and trying to inspire partners, funders, and customers to back you. You need a peer community who get it, because they are living it too.
The StartSomeGood Network will equip you with these things. Join now and feel supported throughout your purpose journey.
We have an amazing program of special guests joining us in 2023. The majority of these events are exclusively for members of the community. Any events which are ticketed are free for members.

The StartSomeGood Network is an initiative of StartSomeGood, an award-winning crowdfunding platform and innovation agency dedicated to increasing the pace of innovation for social change. We do this by helping social entrepreneurs and community leaders design, test, launch and grow social impact projects.

Through StartSomeGood's innovative Crowdmatch program we were able to find
new ways to leverage the local government dollar, while cutting the 'red tape'
that so often goes with government funding programs. Their professionalism
ensured an incredibly successful program - and a creative way to get new social
enterprise growing in our local municipality.
