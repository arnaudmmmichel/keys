The brain cells linked to protection against dementia
People with an abundance of specific neurons are more likely to escape cognitive decline despite having signs of Alzheimer’s in their brains.
Can AI predict who will win a Nobel Prize?
With a few modifications, ChatGPT-like models could enhance the art of identifying future laureates.
How to stop AI deepfakes from sinking society — and science
Deceptive videos and images created using generative AI could sway elections, crash stock markets and ruin reputations. Researchers are developing methods to limit their harm.
Observation of the effect of gravity on the motion of antimatter
Magnetically confined neutral antihydrogen atoms released in a gravity field were found to fall towards Earth like ordinary matter, in accordance with Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
Daily briefing: See the first image released by China’s new high-resolution telescope
The Wide Field Survey Telescope will scan the skies for stellar explosions. Plus, how to do science in a violent border region and how much we owe to earthworms.
Tracking women’s mental health amid trauma in Yemen
Psychologist Anjila Sultan returned to the city where she grew up, after witnessing the effects of war and cultural pressures on mothers and children.

AI and science: what 1,600 researchers think
Master regulator of a mosquito X chromosome discovered
In organisms with X and Y chromosomes, gene expression must be equalized between the sexes. A protein that causes upregulation of gene expression of the X chromosome in male mosquitoes has been discovered.
An all-organic laser that is electrically driven
An organic light-emitting diode has been integrated with an optically driven organic laser to produce laser light from electricity. The design bypasses many of the challenges posed by direct electrical input in such devices.
Measuring the ecological benefits of protected areas
Are protected areas slowing down global biodiversity declines? A global analysis provides evidence that they are, although effects vary across groups of species, and what happens outside protected areas matters, too.
An impressive combination of computational modelling and experimental techniques in live zebrafish embryos reveals how the heart initiates its organized and rhythmic beating.
A trilobite’s last meal reveals feeding behaviour and physiology
The gut contents of a fossilized trilobite, 
, from the Ordovician period (about 465 million years ago), were imaged by a technique called synchrotron microtomography and fully itemized. The results indicate that the animal fed indiscriminately on small shelly invertebrates and that its gut had a neutral to alkaline pH.

Observation of the effect of gravity on the motion of antimatter
Magnetically confined neutral antihydrogen atoms released in a gravity field were found to fall towards Earth like ordinary matter, in accordance with Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
Protected areas slow declines unevenly across the tetrapod tree of life
An analysis of 2,239 terrestrial vertebrate populations shows that they decline more slowly in protected areas than outside protected areas, but the benefits vary across vertebrate classes and depend on the regional context of the protected area.
Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals
                                            The year 2023 marks the mid-point of the 15-year period envisaged to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, targets for global development adopted in September 2015 by all United Nations Member States.

Observation of the effect of gravity on the motion of antimatter
Magnetically confined neutral antihydrogen atoms released in a gravity field were found to fall towards Earth like ordinary matter, in accordance with Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
Daily briefing: See the first image released by China’s new high-resolution telescope
The Wide Field Survey Telescope will scan the skies for stellar explosions. Plus, how to do science in a violent border region and how much we owe to earthworms.
Tracking women’s mental health amid trauma in Yemen
Psychologist Anjila Sultan returned to the city where she grew up, after witnessing the effects of war and cultural pressures on mothers and children.

AI and science: what 1,600 researchers think
Master regulator of a mosquito X chromosome discovered
In organisms with X and Y chromosomes, gene expression must be equalized between the sexes. A protein that causes upregulation of gene expression of the X chromosome in male mosquitoes has been discovered.
An all-organic laser that is electrically driven
An organic light-emitting diode has been integrated with an optically driven organic laser to produce laser light from electricity. The design bypasses many of the challenges posed by direct electrical input in such devices.
Measuring the ecological benefits of protected areas
Are protected areas slowing down global biodiversity declines? A global analysis provides evidence that they are, although effects vary across groups of species, and what happens outside protected areas matters, too.
An impressive combination of computational modelling and experimental techniques in live zebrafish embryos reveals how the heart initiates its organized and rhythmic beating.
A trilobite’s last meal reveals feeding behaviour and physiology
The gut contents of a fossilized trilobite, 
, from the Ordovician period (about 465 million years ago), were imaged by a technique called synchrotron microtomography and fully itemized. The results indicate that the animal fed indiscriminately on small shelly invertebrates and that its gut had a neutral to alkaline pH.

Protected areas slow declines unevenly across the tetrapod tree of life
An analysis of 2,239 terrestrial vertebrate populations shows that they decline more slowly in protected areas than outside protected areas, but the benefits vary across vertebrate classes and depend on the regional context of the protected area.
Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals
                                            The year 2023 marks the mid-point of the 15-year period envisaged to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, targets for global development adopted in September 2015 by all United Nations Member States.
