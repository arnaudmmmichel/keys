meta title:About — Marnie Hawson
meta description:Marnie Hawson is an Australian Certified B Corp photographer, increasing 
impact for those making a difference. She uses photography to increase the 
impact of her clients, who are working towards the Sustainable Development 
Goals (primarily those relating to sustainable architecture, climate change 
solutions and biodiversity and conservation).

I’m in business to bring back nature. I also happen to be a photographer.
I won’t bore you with a story of the first time I picked up my great aunt’s camera and heard my artistic calling. I’m not that kind of photographer. I’m a scientist at heart. I take photos, guide business owners, teach courses and create impact in my own business with a specific outcome in mind: to show people and businesses how to improve their impact on the planet.
I have an Honours degree in Zoology and worked as an environmental scientist for more than a decade. I still think like a scientist. Strategy, tangible action and measurable results are the tools I use to create. 
But environmental science and photography aren’t all that different. They’re both acts of preservation, and they can both be acts of service. 
Living on Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Country, also known as the Macedon Ranges, near Melbourne, Australia, I’m surrounded by thriving forests, gullies and native birdlife. I feel really lucky to live in such a natural environment. And equally motivated to protect and restore the parts that I can. 
My long term plan is to leave a legacy of conservation land to the community, and create a stewardship model for others who want to do the same.
I had a chat with the good folks of 
 recently - talking about purpose, trying to find your why, how I often stand in the kitchen and wonder what the point of life is, and all things sustainable architecture.

How the built environment relates to the SDGs
The built environment, planning, architecture and design interact with every one of the Sustainable Development Goals. 
Not just on an aspirational level or for an imagined future, but through existing buildings and cities all over the world. Meaningful architectural solutions are already here, contributing to sustainable communities and a better quality of life.
Capturing energy-efficient and high performing buildings based on sustainable principles.

Sustainable Development Goals — Marnie Hawson
The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals
What are the Sustainable Development Goals?
The SDGs, agreed by all UN Member States in 2015, is a set of 17 universal goals aimed at achieving significant social, economic, and environmental change by 2030. They provide a global blueprint to end poverty, protect our planet and ensure prosperity, guided by the premise that no-one should be left behind. 
Behind each goal is a series of targets to work towards and indicators available to measure progress.
Why I want to work with clients who align with the Sustainable Development Goals.
Because it means my work is helping to increase important social, environmental, and economic change.
Supporting farmers and workers in developing countries to build sustainable futures through fair terms of trade
EcoGipps, Rendere Trust and Land Covenantors Victoria
Working to protect our biodiversity and advocate for private conservation across Australia
The Sustainable Development Goals are a blueprint for creating a better future.
Increasing the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers
All businesses – of every size, in every sector - can contribute to the SDGs.
A self sustainable farm that provides environmental, life skills and animal studies programs to at-risk youth
The SDGs act as a common language. 
They are understood across the public, private and not-for-profit sectors.
A living, growing art centre celebrating the uniqueness of Miriwoong cultural identity
The SDGs can help to quantify impact.
Each SDG has a series of targets and indicators that provide an extra level of accountability. 
Many Hands by Merchant Road Events
Training young women from refugee backgrounds
Creating a future for Australia’s threatened species, whilst providing an educational facility for the public
The goals are a call to action.
They are inspiring innovative solutions to some of the world’s most complex societal and environmental challenges. I want to be a part of that.

      How we can make an impact with money (photographer edit)
Something we all use, in business or just in our personal lives. MONEY. And what a powerful statement it can make, with what we choose to do with whatever amount we have. 
How we generally use money can be broken into five main areas - income, spending, banking, super and giving. Let’s dive into how we can make an impact with money.
Note, this is an edit specifically talking to fellow photographers, but can be applied to any small business.

The reason I choose to promote these particular issues is because these are the most urgent of our time. I’m fuelled by trying to make a difference in these areas, which means you’ll get the most out of me.
