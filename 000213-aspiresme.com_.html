What is Circular Economy - ASPIRE
The circular economy is a body of knowledge that supports the closing of material and energy loops within the economy. The goal is to retain material and energy flows at their highest possible value and utility for as long as possible, while providing for a safe and regenerative end of life disposal.
Moving our economy from linear to circular shifts the focus from increased consumption and high waste to simply doing more with less.
Keep using things, rather than using them up
Keep materials in use, keep products in use

meta title:Embodied Carbon - ASPIRE
meta description:N/A

Embodied carbon is the total CO
 emissions released during the production of a product. When you look at a wooden chair for example, the embodied carbon accounts for all the carbon that was released in the process of making that chair.
This includes emissions throughout the supply chain, starting from when you create or get raw materials (such as cutting the trees to get the timber) to the manufacturing, transportation, and ultimately assembling the chair. These emissions are different to those generated and measured while using the product, and are called 
 into your company’s policies and practices. Scope 3 emissions are unavoidable and will always occur in any product. ASPIRE helps businesses be in direct control of Scope 3 emissions after the product is produced. This is because when you reuse or trade a resource from the ASPIRE platform, you avoid all the extra emissions that are released while producing brand-new resources.
, all organisations will need to manage their emissions and work towards meeting these commitments. Our embodied carbon tracking feature helps businesses reduce and monitor these emissions.
How will this work on the platform?
The embodied carbon savings represents the emissions that are avoided by re-using resources from the ASPIRE platform, rather than purchasing them brand-new.
These savings are calculated when users exchange resources and distributed across the businesses to create shared value. You can include this data into financial and environmental reports. Click 
 to know more about Embodied Carbon.
