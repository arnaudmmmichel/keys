Four Drunk Parrots – Crafting Creativity with a Splash of Ethical Quirkiness
Welcome to the delightful world of Four Drunk Parrots, where creativity takes flight and ethics dance hand in wing. Our journey began in 2018, a time of profound change and anticipation, just weeks before our founder was set to embrace motherhood. Amidst the whirlwind of transformation, the concept of Four Drunk Parrots was hatched, a testament to the power of dreams, determination, and a touch of playful quirkiness.
From those early days, we soared with wings spread wide, experiencing rapid growth akin to a parrot in full flight. Guided by a vision of ethical innovation, we’ve evolved into a vibrant agency spanning three locations, fueled by a team of twelve spirited minds who infuse every project with passion and purpose.
Our path has been guided by a North Star of ethical and quirky MarTech prowess. We are not content with ordinary; we relish in the extraordinary. Our commitment to environmental and social responsibility is exemplified by our journey to become a certified B Corp agency. This milestone underscored our dedication to a higher standard, merging creativity with conscientiousness to create a lasting impact.
Standing out in a sea of sameness is our forte.
We wield the art of storytelling as our magic wand, weaving captivating narratives that forge deep emotional bonds with audiences. Our campaigns aren’t just marketing; they’re unforgettable tales that linger in hearts and minds.
But storytelling is just the beginning. We sprinkle in a dash of quirkiness, transforming campaigns into memorable experiences that capture attention and spark curiosity. This playful touch is our signature, creating an indelible mark that resonates.
Every strategy we craft is an immersive journey, a 360-degree experience that champions authenticity and distinctiveness. We don’t just solve problems; we orchestrate symphonies of uniqueness.
Yet, our approach isn’t built solely on creativity. We marry our artistic flair with data-driven precision, sculpting strategies that resonate with consumer behavior and market trends. Our commitment to ethics amplifies our appeal to conscious consumers, those who value brands making a positive difference.
Each strategy is tailored to the client’s DNA, forging connections that are deep, genuine, and relatable. In a world of noise, we create harmonious melodies that stand out and leave lasting impressions.
As pioneers of change, we embrace learning and adaptation. We’re relentless in our pursuit of innovation, staying on the cutting edge to ensure our strategies remain fresh and relevant.
However, our greatest strength lies in partnerships. We see clients as collaborators, not transactions. By delving deep into their goals and values, we craft solutions that resonate profoundly and differentiate spectacularly.
Our trophy cabinet boasts achievements that mirror our principles.
Climate Neutral Certification, B Corp status, and active involvement in environmental and community initiatives paint a vivid picture of our commitment to a better world.Our aspirations for the future are as vast as the skies. We dream of Innovative Excellence, Global Sustainability Leadership, Empowered Collaboration, and a culture of Continuous Learning. We aspire to empower clients, foster partnerships, and make a positive mark on the industry and the world.
Join us on this journey of creativity, ethics, and impact. Four Drunk Parrots isn’t just a name; it’s a commitment to crafting stories that matter, campaigns that resonate, and legacies that endure. Together, let’s soar to new heights and leave an indelible imprint on the landscape of MarTech and beyond.
Our company started with the wish to be better than the other marketing agency sharks out there. With the wish to stand out by doing the right thing for others but also for the planet, our communities and our people.
This drive is now becoming something much bigger. It’s become a mission. A movement. Our soul.
Why? Because we have power, as a business and as a team. Because we get our fuel from being the voice for many. We will advocate, enlist and activate. We will protect what should be preserved.
We believe that with a great passion for nature and people comes great responsibility, to market and build stuff responsibly and protect nature for generations to come.
Caring is no longer enough. We have to act now and be generous with our time, with our money, and our actions. That’s why we are committed to the work of building a more inclusive company and being a force for social and environmental good.
Together, we can make a difference.
We Use Business As a Force For Good
At Four Drunk Parrots we put our money where our mouth is.
We’re proudly B Corp Certified and put purpose before profit, giving back to help people and the planet. This is why we have formally committed to donate the equivalent of 5% or more of our time through pro-bono services. We give 1% of our total revenue to One Percent for the Planet.
We are Climate Neutral and are committed to helping other businesses become more sustainable.
This is the essence of how we operate; using business as a force for good.
There’s nothing we like more than rolling up our sleeves and starting a brand new project.

Strategy - Four Drunk Parrots | MarTech Agency
Strategy doesn’t need to be complicated. It simply defines where you play and how you win.
Do you have one in place though?
When we start working with a new client, we really take the time to listen to their needs and their business story. We want to know where you want to be in three years time. We want to hear your big picture idea. We want to be inspired by your vision. Then we put pen to paper and break down your annual goals into actionable marketing strategies.
A strategy is worth nothing when it’s left floating on an Excel Spreadsheet. We make sure we bring your team on the same journey, excite and inspire them about what’s ahead. We will set SMART goals and properly define and delegate them throughout your business and our own.
It’s great to have a big vision and ideas but you can’t build Jurassic Park if you only have the budget for a chicken coop! Our CMO Sonja Ceri is a master of marketing budgets and loves all things spreadsheets. With a degree in Economics, she is your go-to for numbers – your numbers
Do you have a lot on your plate? We do too. That’s why we are a huge fan of organising everything into calendars so we know when and what is happening and who is responsible for getting it done on time.
Now, that you have your plan and a budget someone needs to keep the team accountable. Our project manager will set up an Asana Dashboard for your marketing strategy and check in with all stakeholders on a regular basis so nothing slips through the cracks and milestones are reached on time.
You want to know how your ad campaign is performing or where we are in regards to conversion YTD? No need to wait till someone is in the office. You get access to your own company marketing dashboard and can see in real-time what’s happening in which channel. Transparent. How it should be.

We knew technology would change the world…we just didn’t know exactly where it would take us.
Now, Marketing has become incredibly technical. And that’s where we come in.
We harness and build upon technology to achieve marketing goals and objectives.
We call that MarTech as in the crossroad of marketing and technology.
Our services span customer relationship management, advertising, event management, content marketing, user experience management, social media marketing, reputation management, email marketing, mobile marketing (web, apps, and SMS), marketing automation, marketing data management, analytics, ecommerce, public relations, sales enablement, surveys, and search marketing.
New experiences and emerging technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and more are finding their way into existing and new platforms.
Using a well-functioning MarTech stack gives you, as a the client, a plethora of advantages, such as
Attribution – The ability to understand how every marketing and sales investment I’m making is impacting customer retention, customer value, and acquisition.
Real-Time Data – The ability to observe activity in real-time rather than waiting for hours or days to assemble the appropriate reports to see and optimize my clients’ marketing efforts.
360-Degree View – The ability to see every interaction with a prospect or customer to better serve them, communicate with them, understand them, and provide value to them.
Omni-Channel – The ability to speak to a customer in the medium or channel they want to be communicated with from the system that I can easily work within.
Intelligence – The ability to move beyond my own bias as a marketer and have a system that segments, personalizes, and executes the right message at the right time to the right place for my customer.

Our designers work directly with you to pinpoint your company’s brand identity – from distinct logo design to eye-catching investor decks and infographic one-pagers, amongst other branded company collateral – your company is guaranteed to stand out. The branding and marketing materials we will design for your company will inform, generate buzz, and get the results you’re looking for when building and growing your company.
Brand Identity is the message your client or customer gets from your product, service or image. Brand is everything today, so this is incredibly important for a business (or person) to get right. As the saying goes – first impressions count and your brand identity is how your prospective clients will perceive you from the very first glimpse. At 4DP we can help you create a consistent, stand out from the crowd brand identity, and here’s a few ways we do just that.
What is the name or hex code of the colour in your logo? How do you want your logo to look on a grey background? These and many other questions will be answered when you have a style guide in place. Some people think a style guide is only for huge, well known brands but that’s not true – everyone who has a brand, a logo or the idea of such should have a style guide in place to keep your branding and style consistent wherever it is seen by your potential customers.
We might be a small team but our two graphic designers we have on board know their stuff! We have developed many brands over the years. Some small. Some grew. Either or, it’s a lot of fun to see the creatives spinning ideas, discussing colour psychology or getting totally immersed in the world of fonts. Let us develop your perfect logo!
When you have a car, you take it to the garage to get serviced. Your brand could do with the same level of love every now and then. Aesthetics change over time and your brand needs to adapt if you want it to stand out from the crowd. We can help you making subtle changes to your brand without disrupting what you stand for or what you do.
If you are active on Instagram, then you know that first impressions count. Your brand is perceived instantly by the images, fonts and colours being used. Make sure you are in the know of which colours suit your brand. If you are not quite sure then we can help you by putting together a colour palette that you can use to style your social media and collateral (or assets).

Through strategic business consulting, logo development, collateral design, and an invitation to a fundraising gala, we worked together to elevate their brand and make a lasting impact.
There’s nothing we like more than rolling up our sleeves and starting a brand new project.
This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.
We acknowledge the traditional owners and custodians of the land on which we work and we pay respect to the Elders, past, present and future.
