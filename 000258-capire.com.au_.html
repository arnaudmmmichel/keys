Capire | Giving every person a voice | Hearing Client Voices: Research Paper
cohealth commissioned Capire to research ‘client voice’ models in response to gaps in their understanding of client experiences. 
cohealth is a not-for-profit community organisation that provides essential health services in Melbourne’s CBD, and northern and western suburbs. Part of what distinguishes cohealth is its commitment to working with communities and to making people feel safe and included. In response to gaps in their understanding of client experiences and to encourage greater community voices, cohealth commissioned Capire to research ‘client voice’ models.
The intention was to inform the organisational processes and decisions to enable cohealth to better embed client voice across the organisation, from governance to operations. This included helping cohealth to determine: 
a shared understanding of what client voice looks like (consultation/co-design/governance) 
where client voice is incorporated into the business (service design/governance). 
The objectives included reviewing case studies and documents, and interviewing key stakeholders, to understand what similar organisations are doing, and how they define, hear and incorporate client voice.
Other objectives included identifying practical application of client voice models; exploring emerging trends; identifying challenges in developing and applying models; and understanding the cultural context and systemic levers that support implementation of client voice models.
We also explored remuneration practices for lived experience participants, payment processes, minimum wage requirement limitations, and linkages with Centrelink support.
Capire’s research paper ‘Hearing Client Voices’ provides a summary of eight interviews and 12 documents reviewed. It includes a 
review of the terminology used in other contexts as well as terminology recommendations. It also provides 
a list of key actions and suggestions on topics including: 
experiences of the ‘client voice’ model
how to apply ‘client voice’ in organisations
Melbourne CBD and northern & western suburbs

Capire | Giving every person a voice | Level Crossing Removal Project
Capire engaged communities regarding the removal of three level crossings: two in Ringwood and one in Croydon, which will make the Lilydale Line level-crossing free.
The Level Crossing Removal Project (LXRP) was established in 2015 to remove Victoria’s most dangerous level crossings. By 2025 it will have removed 85 level crossings, making it one of Victoria’s most significant rail projects.  
In 2022, Capire began working with LXRP to engage communities regarding the removal of three level crossings: two in Ringwood and one in Croydon, which will make the Lilydale Line level-crossing free. Approximately 36,000 vehicles travel through these crossings each day, plus 33 trains during the morning peak (7am–9am), when boom gates can be down for up to 23 minutes.
Set in busy neighbourhoods, these level crossing removals were always going to draw strong community interest.
Since they were still in the planning phase, there was significant opportunity for communities to learn more and provide feedback.
Capire and LXRP engaged each community on issues including traffic, open space, user accessibility, active transport connections, landscape and urban design, and construction impacts and mitigation. A range of online and in-person events were used to maximise flexibility, allowing people to participate in a way that felt comfortable. Participants were able to ask questions and interact directly with the project teams.
Capire successfully managed a number of challenges, including adapting to changing timeframes, which impacted resourcing; ensuring that LXRP staff and presenters were consistently briefed; and managing the expectations of LXRP staff and community suppliers.
six online information sessions, two in-person information sessions, and two Construction Liaison Group bus tours. These engagements built community knowledge about the projects and allowed people to share their ideas and concerns. 
We learned that people are concerned about a range of issues, including (but not limited to) the removal of trees, noise during construction, and potential impacts on local schools and businesses. This
 feedback, along with technical input, will help the project teams make critical decisions to progress the project designs.
