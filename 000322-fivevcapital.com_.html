WEâRE SUPPORTING GROWTH BUSINESSES IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND / SIGN UP TO LEARN MORE
Address: Level 3, 243 Liverpool Street
Growth and success go beyond just capability and funds. It is about trusted, long term partnerships with the people and businesses we invest in.
FIVE V UPDATE |Â INTRODUCING FIVE V NEW ZEALAND â
The growth partner to some of Australia and New Zealandâs leading companies, we invest in market-leading, innovative businesses in industries with strong tail-winds. We are scale enablers, working with our portfolio companies to grow, evolve and thrive in the markets they compete in. 
Providing both Private Equity and Venture Capital, our team of specialists and strategies allow us to draw on a range of unique insights and experiences that facilitate opportunities for long-term growth and success. 
With an unparalleled network across all sectors, geographies and stages of investment, we are not only aligned with the companies we back, but the Five V team are among the biggest investors in the funds we manage.
We choose to partner with Australia & New Zealandâs highest quality founders, managers and businesses, while committing a significant portion of our own personal capital. 
We partner with businesses that demonstrate unique and differentiated capability in their specific niche, and that have a track-record of growth, delivering profitable success. We combine our breadth of experience with the founder's and manager's depth of expertise, and lean into our deep investor network to unlock significant value-creation initiatives. 
Our goal is to build on the best of the business today - through flexible capital solutions, enhanced strategic focus, amplified investment capability, technology-enablement and international impact. 
The results are market-leading, internationally competitive and sustainably scalable businesses.
We provide flexible capital for significant minority partnerships through to majority partnerships. Typically this equates to A$30-100 million of equity for a combination of sell-down Â and growth capital.
We are industry agnostic and invest across a broad range of industries that exhibit attractive end-market characteristics.
We invest in businesses with significant Australia and New Zealand presence, typically with global growth ambitions.
With real-world experience in startups and scale-ups, we empower our portfolio companies to pursue the ideas and thinking that propels them forward.
As Series A and B-stage investors, we partner with startups that have reached product-market fit and are ready to scale. Beyond financial support, we enable our portfolio companies to scale by activating our diverse network and with strategic support.
We target an initial investment of $1M to $10M. With access to multiple pools of capital, we can invest up to $20M across multiple rounds to support our portfolio companies through their stages of growth.
We invest in software companies powering the future of business (commonly referred to as B2B SaaS). Our focus on B2B SaaS is driven by our belief in the exceptional abilities of Australian entrepreneurs in this field.
We are open to all industry sectors. We support founders pursuing large addressable markets, and creating products their business customers adore, whilst prioritising strong unit economics.
Our investment strategy focuses on Australia and New Zealand, but we also invest in offshore opportunities where we have a differentiated perspective.
We are proudly B-Corp certified, recognising our commitment to meeting a strong standard with respect to our Environmental, Social and Governance practices (âESGâ). Our constitution recognises our dual purpose to balance generating strong returns for our investments while also making a positive contribution to the environment and communities in which we operate. Our approach to integrating consideration of ESG factors in all areas of our business in is outlined in our Responsible Investment Policy which is a public document.
We also believe in making a strong contribution to our community though donating funds and volunteering time with worthy community and environmental causes. We are proud members of "Pledge 1%â Â recognising our commitment to making a meaningful financial contribution to charitable causes each year.

Over the next 20 years, $4 trillion of family and private business wealth will transfer ownership. Horizons makes it easy to invest in the best of these Australian and New Zealand private equity opportunities.
Our online application process is quick and simple. Follow the âApply Nowâ link to get started or download our Launch Presentation and Information Memorandum to learn more.
Horizons Fund is only open to wholesale investors
Horizons invests in the best private Australian and New Zealand businesses. 
We partner with the owners and managers of exceptional businesses, combining their unique expertise with Five Vâs broad commercial experience. The combination drives growth and delivers exceptional outcomes for all parties. 
Five V is a market leader
Five V was founded in 2016 . Today we have a team of 25 people in Sydney managing $1.5b of investments, including 4 private equity funds that have market-leading returns. 
Horizons will invest alongside Five Vâs private equity funds in all their new investments. 
Horizons minimum investment amount of $100,000 is significantly lower than what most private equity funds require.
Horizons accepts initial and additional investment applications at the end of each calendar quarter. 
From March 2025, Horizons will also accept redemptions on the same quarterly basis, so long as total requests for redemption do not exceed 5% of the value of the fund. 
By comparison, most private equity funds have one set application deadline with no ability to make additional investments and require a commitment of up to 10 years.
Horizons invests alongside Five Vâs private equity funds. 
Every time one of them makes an investment, Horizons invests directly into the same asset alongside the fund. 
This simple and direct ownership model means investors do not incur fees from multiple fund layers.
Five V staff are significant investors in our funds. 
This alignment ensures focus and a shared vision of what success looks like.

We target an initial investment of $1M to $10M. With access to multiple pools of capital, we can invest up to $20M across multiple rounds to support our portfolio companies through their stages of growth.
We invest in software companies powering the future of business (commonly referred to as B2B SaaS). Our focus on B2B SaaS is driven by our belief in the exceptional abilities of Australian entrepreneurs in this field.
We are open to all industry sectors. We support founders pursuing large addressable markets, and creating products their business customers adore, whilst prioritising strong unit economics.
Our investment strategy focuses on Australia and New Zealand, but we also invest in offshore opportunities where we have a differentiated perspective.
With real world start-up and scale-up experience, our focus in Venture Capital is to empower our portfolio companies to pursue the ideas and thinking that drives them forward. 
As Series A and B stage investors, we partner with businesses who have identified their product-market fit and are ready to scale. In doing so, we enable scale through the activation of our diverse network and help our portfolio companies to grow with strategic, financial support.
Our target initial investment range is from $1m to $10m. We invest up to $20m across multiple rounds from the pools of capital we have access to. We back companies across multiple rounds to support them through their stages of growth.
Open to all industry sectors and business models, we focus on backing amazing founders, going after large addressable markets, with products that customers love, and have strong unit economics.
We focus our investment strategy on Australia and New Zealand, and selectively invest in other offshore opportunities where we have a differential insight.
