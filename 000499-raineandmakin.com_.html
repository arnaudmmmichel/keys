Helping for-purpose organisations turn brands into assets and marketing into results. 
We’re human-centered, meaning we focus on and involve your people and stakeholders throughout the project process. We ask questions, we listen, we research, and then we bring clarity and creativity to your situation.
We turn your brand into a powerful strategic asset. Your brand strategy articulates a brand purpose that is relevant to your audience, that your organisation can authentically deliver on better than (or different to) your competition. An effective brand strategy provides a ‘north star’ for the future of your organisation, creating alignment inside and out. It answers the questions; who are you? And, where are you going? 
A strong brand identity sets you apart from the noise. Distinctiveness is the backbone of all your marketing and brand awareness work, shaping your audience’s perception of who you are. Your brand identity should be an expression of your brand strategy; bringing to life how you look, sound and feel for your audience. We create brand identities that are relevant, memorable, own-able and valuable. 
Your brand and marketing effectiveness is dependent on your ability to create consistent and distinctive experiences that can’t be ignored. Tell your story through compelling visuals and communications that align your audience’s experience with your brand’s purpose. 
Audience engagement should be at the heart of every business. When your marketing plan is done right, it results not just in leads and sales, but also building awareness and trust. Without a strategically sound plan for marketing, you can’t accelerate your impact or growth.
Having worked directly in fundraising departments before, we know first-hand the effort that goes into growing your supporter base whilst keep your exisiting supporters engaged. We combine our skills in brand and marketing to help you with your fundraising strategy, all the way through to the design and execution of your campaigns.

Good Cycles — Raine & Makin
Scaling a social enterprise to a broader audience.
Good Cycles is a leader in the social enterpise space. Focused on providing employment opportunities for at-risk youth, Good Cycles’ offering had evolved beyond a bike shop to include large scale civil works and maintenance services. Good Cycles came to us to assess its brand architecture and define a brand strategy and identity that would allow them to flex across vastly different B2C and B2B audiences, moving them beyond ‘just a bike shop’. As always with for-purpose organisations, the brief was to create a brand that reimagined their future, without losing who they are today and the existing goodwill. 
We created this brand statement to unify Good Cycles’ brand. Their work with at-risk youth changes lives, while their bike shop and bike-based business and government services change cities to be more sustainable. Brand identity assets were created to enhance the communication of this vision. The ‘G’ icon representing cycles of change, shedding the previous bike wheel icon that pigeon holed Good Cycles. A vibrant optimistic gradient was produced to represent ‘change’ and the transitions taking place both for at-risk youth as they find employment, and also cities as they become more sustainable. 
 Flexing seamlessly from B2C bike shop to B2B services provider. 
“Raine & Makin were a wealth of guidance, creativity and patience in providing us with an identity that reflected the evolution and future of Good Cycles. We've received nothing but positivity since launching, and I owe it to the team for putting together such a polished and well-thought-out brand.”
— Jen Arnold - Marketing Manager, Good Cycles
Good Cycles has successfully launched the brand evolution to all stakeholders across Australia, with continued growth in their Business & Government services.
