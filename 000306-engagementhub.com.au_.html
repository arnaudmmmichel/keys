meta description:The only Australian owned and hosted engagement and stakeholder management software. Find out about Engagement Hub and our unique software

We are passionate engagement professionals here to support you every step of the way and add value to your engagement projects and processes
In 2013, our Founder, a stakeholder engagement strategist with 25 years private and public sector experience, was frustrated with the limited software options on the market and the administration burden of requiring 3-4 different software solutions to drive effective online engagement. With our software engineers and much determination and user testing, Engagement Hub was launched in March 2016 and has fast become an industry leader in online engagement software. 
Engagement Hub is the only engagement software to include a built-in SRM system & advanced reporting functionality and we pride ourselves on our excellent client relationships and regular deployments of new features.
				With more than 100 collective years of government and private sector experience, our software clients receive immense value-added, expert-led advice from our consultancy team.
Our team of stakeholder engagement strategists, communication experts and software engineers collaborate with our clients to design and deploy more functions and features to ensure Engagement Hub continues to lead the way in digital stakeholder engagement.
Our clients not only benefit from world-class stakeholder engagement software but from our team’s diverse experience across stakeholder engagement, communications, issues management, placemaking, economic development, community capacity building and software development.
We are proudly an Australian owned and operated company with our data centre hosted in Sydney.					
				Our mission is to work with both our software and consultancy clients to deliver:
Diverse flexible tools which lend themselves to different projects and stakeholder groups
A reduction in client administration burden and ease of reporting on consultation outcomes
Across our business units, we are privileged to partner with forward-thinking clients from diverse sectors who inspire our team to continually innovate and surpass their expectations.
Our team is here to guide you through implementation, getting the best out of your software and helping you maximise your engagement through strategic advice.

						"We’ve been able to use the Engagement Hub platform as our main website, staff intranet, SRM, e-newsletter system, event-booking system and engagement platform. This is a huge benefit to us – it's all-in-one instead of having to use multiple platforms and software and integrate them.  
What really stands out about Engagement Hub is the flexibility – other systems seem so fixed and rigid. We didn’t want an ‘out-of-the-box' product and Engagement Hub has the flexibility to truly tailor everything to our needs. The team are also really keen to take on board feedback and nothing is too much trouble for the support team, it’s a really personalised service."					
						"Online engagement has completely transformed our engagement process here on the Fraser Coast. By using an online platform, we have been able to create a community space for the life of our projects – engaging with the community along the whole journey. The reporting and data functions have enabled us to be able to provide more in-depth analysis. That’s made it so much easier to evaluate a project – including being able to evaluate in real time. Engagement Hub has been useful in a vast array of projects.					
Community Engagement Manager, Fraser Coast Regional Council
						"Implementing an online engagement platform has allowed us to adopt a whole-system approach to meaningful engagement. Despite the obvious appeal of a dynamic online platform, the real beauty lies in the ability to meet high performance standards in terms of a strong data and evidence base. In a relatively short time, this technology has already proven to be an invaluable tool with the ability to import historical data from a multitude of sources, improving the capacity to build on, and identify community aspirations.”					
Central West Local Land Services, NSW
						“After several demonstrations the Shire chose to undertake the services of Engagement Hub. Throughout implementation they have been reactive to our needs, supportive to our learning the system and have held our hand guiding us to better improve the way in which we can enhance our community engagement.” - 					
Organisational Development, Shire of Mundaring Council
						“We are actively using our engagement platform for a large scope of projects that range from environmental planning, public art, skatepark design consultation, Council policies and more. 
The online platform means consultations can be accessed 24 hours a day – offering greater flexibility for hard-to-reach stakeholders with limited availability to engage.
The greatest benefit of pairing online engagement with more traditional methods is that we gain richer feedback from our community which helps Council make decisions that reflect the values and aspirations of our local residents and businesses”.					
Senior Community Activation Officer, Lockyer Valley Regional Council
						"The support we receive is outstanding. I’ve had extensive experience working with online tools, and Engagement Hub’s customer service is second to none. Whenever we’ve submitted a ticket to the helpdesk, they reply within 24 hours, and always correctly interpret just what we need and implement it quickly. 
“The flexibility within the software is also excellent. It allows us to think laterally and apply the tools creatively to support our agile project delivery model."

We understand how important it is to brand your platform correctly and we have created multiple ways to customise the look of your site from custom URLs to colours, fonts and choice of several themes and layouts.

meta description:Find out about the benefits of an Engagement Hub platform and how it can transform how you engage, consult and manage your stakeholders

Engagement Hub is transforming what it means to care about an issue, to be heard and informed and to create co-operative, collaborative data-driven social solutions.
What are the benefits of an Engagement Hub Platform?
Engagement Hub is the only software world-wide offering fully-integrated community engagement, stakeholder relationship management and insights reporting all-in-one platform. 
Simply, every other product on the market offers far less, for a lot more money.
When you’re selecting an online engagement platform, you are assessing several key factors such as security, functionality, features and compliance. 
However it’s also important to look at the type of support you will receive, the experience of the company and the flexibility in approach and functionality. A rigid system with add-ons at an extra cost can become costly in more ways than just dollars. 
You need a company that understands genuine engagement and will walk with you to achieve it. 
Engagement Hub is unlike other software on the market – find out why… 
Engagement Hub was born out of a need for better software
We are community and stakeholder specialists who were frustrated by the lack of comprehensive software for our industry that fitted our needs – so we built one! And over 3.2 million meaningful engagements have now taken place through our software.
We’re the only software to include a built-in Stakeholder Relationship Management tool because we don’t like using multiple software applications and we don’t believe you should have to. With us, you can manage all your online and offline engagements in one place – truly integrating all stakeholder communication together. 
We’re trusted by all levels of government, corporates and not-for-profits simply because we don’t just provide software – we understand engagement. We add incredible value to our clients by helping you not only maximise your site, but also your entire engagement process. 
Offering unparalleled levels of flexibility and software customisation means you can develop a completely bespoke site.
Unlike other software providers, we don’t hem you in to set parameters. Instead we give you the freedom to customise your site, layout, projects, widgets and how you manage your stakeholders and reporting.
You choose what’s visible, what’s prominent and how you bring it all together under your unique branded platform.
Engagement Hub offers truly unmatched levels of customisation. 
with us to see how we can customise the software for your organisation. 
 – create a specific domain name for your platform
 – titles, url, enable  / disable widgets and drag and drop the tools
choose from several themes and layouts
 – with no extra charges for private projects
 – display where your project is at with 5 different settings – unpublished, published, in review, closed or archived and even schedule consultations to go live automatically at a certain time
 – customise email notifications, send email campaigns and communicate with an individual, a segment or all of your stakeholders – all without leaving the security of the system
 – by project or whole site so you control the internal management of your platform
 – you control the level of moderation per widget, per project and across the site
 – use pop up messages, content banners and select what tools you need for each project
 – Download instant, editable reports per project or across the whole site and quickly identify trends and issues from your reporting dashboard
This is where it gets really unique! As we said, we are the only software to include a fully integrated Stakeholder Management Tool where you can upload, record, segment, report and communicate with your stakeholders. 
No need for additional expensive software – our system helps you capture all your online and offline activity securely in one place. 
Imagine no more stakeholder matrix spreadsheets and instead an interactive system that helps you take your stakeholder management to the next level. View our quick video here. 
We can get you up and running within just a few days. We work closely with you during implementation to customise your site, create graphics, input information and train you on the system so you can hit the ground running.
