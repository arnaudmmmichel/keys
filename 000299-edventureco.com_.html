EdventureCo is a premium provider of digital, soft and future skills training that prepares the workforce of today for success tomorrow.
Disruption, exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, is creating new roles and destroying existing ones leading to millions of workers requiring transition to new occupations by 2030. CEOs are concerned about the availability of key skills and see skills gaps within their organisations as the biggest barrier to adoption of new technologies. This has resulted in L&D increasing being viewed as a strategic investment for enterprise and government.
Job disruption is counter-balanced by job creation in new fields: the ‘jobs of tomorrow’. Over the coming decade, a non-negligible share of newly created jobs will be in wholly new occupations, or existing occupations undergoing significant transformations in terms of their content and skills requirements. Millions of workers will need to transition to new occupations by 2030, a disruption that has only been accelerated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While CEOs plan to invest more in digital initiatives, they are extremely concerned about the availability of relevant skills
The ability of global companies to harness the growth potential of new technological adoption is hindered by skills shortages and L&D is becoming a strategic investment required to fill organisations’ skills gaps. At EdventureCo we see these gaps appearing across three different areas. 
EdventureCo ensures companies stay ahead of the digital curve and that their technology does not outpace the skills of their people
Through its digital skills training offerings, EdventureCo has a large and varied portfolio of over 700 instructor-led technology training courses, delivered to over 15,000 students annually online, in its training facilities or at client premises

Across APAC, companies are facing the challenge of digital disruption and making efforts to go digital
The platform allows EdventureCo to expand by leveraging its platform of skilled trainers and vendor relationships
Technology is displacing routine and repetitive roles while increasing the requirement for soft skills such as emotional intelligence, communication, negotiation and leadership
ENS, is a global provider of negotiation and influencing training based around a unique framework, underpinned by behavioural science. Plain English Foundation is the Australian authority in clear communication, with over 15 years experience helping organisations to improve their writing.
In 2025, analytical thinking, creativity and flexibility will be among the most sought-after skills
The ENS negotiation framework is delivered in 10 languages by 50 industry professionals across the world
