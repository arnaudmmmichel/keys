meta description:Mobile & modular sidestream on-site solutions for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, to purify water or solvents and recover valuable components such as Palladium, Platinum, and Zinc. 

Inopsys provides on-site mobile & modular side stream solutions for the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, to purify water or solvents and recover valuable components.
why we do what we do
Our very first project was in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceutica and was named 'plant-on-a-truck'. This mobile and modular unit made it possible for the company to purify a complex sidestream on-site. This more specifically means ...

We understand that the treatment of a side stream is not the core activity of your business, that’s ours. We are aware of the difficulty of return on investment for a side stream that is generated for perhaps a couple years. That is why we provide our solutions “pay-per-use”, so
