Cutting-edge scientific research is helping us to understand how our gut microbiome influences almost every aspect of our health.
Think you’re just you? Think again!
Your body is home to trillions of microbes - mostly bacteria - which live almost everywhere, from the lining of your gut, to the surface of your skin.
The largest and most diverse community of microbes live within your gut, and are collectively known as the gut 
Just like your fingerprint, your gut microbiome is unique to you, and no one else. While the types of microbes that live in your gut - and their abundance - generally remains stable over time, external factors such as your diet, and any medications you take, can alter its composition.
The microbiome is a balance between beneficial and harmful bacteria
The gut microbiome is a delicate balance between beneficial microbes, which work to improve many aspects of our health and wellbeing, and those which can cause us harm if their growth isn’t kept in check. These beneficial microbes help us in a number of ways: they help to digest the food we eat, regulate our immune system, and protect us against disease-causing microbes.
Your gut microbes can even change the way you think and feel
We now know that the microbes which live in the gut can communicate with distant parts of the body, including the bones, lungs, and even the brain. Gut microbes are thought to produce specific metabolites and neurotransmitters (such as dopamine and serotonin) which travel to the brain, affecting your thoughts, feelings, emotions and behaviour. This two-way communication pathway between the gut and the brain (known as the 
) is a fascinating area of research, with scientists seeking to understand how our gut microbiota can influence our risk of developing various mental health conditions.
An unbalanced gut microbiome can be harmful to our health
Because of these communication channels, our gut microbiome plays an integral role in our overall health and wellbeing. Its disruption - known as 
 - is associated with an increasing number of chronic metabolic conditions.
Probiotics are a powerful way to support health and wellbeing
Probiotics are defined as ‘live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host’. While probiotics are mostly bacteria, such as 
, certain yeasts are recognised as probiotics, too. They are delivered to the gut, where they interact with our own gut microbiota and get to work producing health-promoting metabolites. The most well known benefits of probiotics relate to their ability to support the health of our digestive tract and immune system. In addition to these general benefits, certain strains of probiotic bacteria can target specific aspects of our health and wellbeing through various pathways.
Activated Probiotics™ are targeted probiotic products to support the health of the whole family
 products were created to include specific probiotic strains with unique abilities to improve the symptoms of specific complex conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, and support various aspects of health, including digestion and iron absorption, bone health, immune system function, mood balance, and sleep quality. The result is a range of 9 precision probiotics that offer specific health benefits.

Increased hygiene practices and sterile living conditions have had a negative impact on the gut microbiome and its beneficial bacteria in recent decades. It is widely thought that because these changes to the gut microbiome have altered how the immune system functions, they have also contributed to the dramatic rise in allergic conditions.
Activated Probiotics’ allergy range is informed by research that has discovered specific probiotic strains with an ability to address imbalances in the gut microbiome and reduce the severity of symptoms in some atopic allergic conditions, such as eczema*. 
*when used alongside appropriate medical care.
