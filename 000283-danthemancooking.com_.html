We are a boutique Sydney Caterer on a mission to deliver boldly delicious food, with an ethical approach to our sourcing, cooking and service.
We love good food. And if you’re like us, you know that it brings people together, creates lasting memories, and fills the soul (and our tummies). We make food that people want to eat.
We all need to take more responsibility for the resources we use. So we’ve made a commitment to reduce waste in our whole operation (zero to landfill is our mission). 
Now more than ever we need to support each other, so we collab with local businesses that share our philosophy. We support them, they support us, we support you. Win-win-win.
“It was the most perfect day, honestly went so well! Thanks for all your help and for making it so not stressful! People have said the food was hands down the best food they have ever eaten at an event and people have whole cheese station albums on their phones which is hilarious.”
“Hilary it was AMAZING!!! We had people walking past the wharf looking in and asking who had catered! Thanks again and Merry Christmas to you and the team. Absolutely amazing job, yet again!
“Everything was really delicious! My favourite was the brisket with romesco and the Gem Lettuce! Everyone commented on those two the most from what I heard. I even recreated the salad on the weekend for a gathering.
