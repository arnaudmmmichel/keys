As a B Corp registered business we actively seek to develop property that benefits the community
A partnership between MiHaven and Access Community Housing Cairns secured funds from the Federal Government’s Building Better Regions Fund to develop secure accommodation for up to 10 vulnerable women and their children. The project, spearheaded by Access Community Housing (ACHC), is the first time the Far North’s not-for-profit community housing provider has developed its own, tailor-made accommodation solution.
The development was designed and built by MiHaven and handed over to ACHC as a turn-key property ready for vulnerable tenants. The property delivers an innovative solution to resident security, sustainability and energy efficiency, privacy and durability.
It’s been a successful project and a partnership between the Commonwealth Government, the State Government, ACHC and MiHaven. We are really excited that the project will relieve the pressure on shelters and women’s services in the Cairns area.

What our residents are saying about MiHaven Living
Customer service was second to none throughout my whole experience before, during and after my visit!
I must say...You’ve got the basics right!
Quality furnishings, brilliant location, secure premises, reasonable price…tick, tick, tick and tick!
All staff were incredibly warm and welcoming and so responsive to any query. They genuinely made my stay feel like home. Stacey even went above and beyond to get me a small side mirror traveling to at least 2 or 3 different shops to find one. So unexpected and lovely at the same time.
Best of all were the people I was able to engage with during my stay. My housemates were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island TAFE health students, such amazing people. Every night we sat up talking, and I genuinely learned so much about indigenous cultures during my one week stay. Being able to live with a diverse group of people, understand more about true Australian culture and history, truly made my stay that much richer. Must say as an executive, I was a bit unsure about shared living as it’s been awhile, but I would do it again in a heartbeat. Next visit to Cairns will certainly see me at a MiHaven accommodation.
Beautiful, clean, modern and secure accommodation. The MiHaven Living team do a fantastic job in making sure everyone is well settled in and happy in their new home! Would 100% recommend.
