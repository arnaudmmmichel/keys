Diagnosing the current state of innovation culture within an organisation working on the frontline to put an end to childhood cancer
Children’s Cancer Institute (CCI) in Sydney, Australia ‘exists solely to put an end to childhood cancer’ under the guiding principal “It’s not if. It’s when”. The incredibly talented and passionate staff at CCI work tirelessly to make this vision a reality; they believe every child can be saved and work tirelessly with a focus on the patient. To increase collaboration between clinicians and researchers, CCI is currently undergoing a major organisational transformation; moving to a Comprehensive Childhood Cancer Centre (CCCC) which would mean a change of location, organisational structure, and way of working for the institute.
As part of our 1% Pledge, we worked with the CCI leadership team to help them devise a strategy for the future by, ensuring efficient allocation of resources and funding to enable the talented staff at CCI to focus on their patients in a clinical environment and continue to undertake world-class research, bringing them closer to curing cancer for children. 
Venture scouting and (Fintech) startup incubation for a leading global bank
A global bank wanted to identify potential industry disruptors (Fintech startups) that may be future investment, partnering, or acquisition opportunities that would provide the bank with a competitive advantage.  The bank’s Fintech team based in the US launched a global Fintech challenge and required partners with deep connections into the startup ecosystems across major Fintech hubs to assist in identifying and incubating startups.    
Designing the future of financial planning and wealth advisory for a leading (ASX20) Australian bank
The wealth management division of a major diversified financial services group wanted to reimagine financial planning and wealth advisory, and better enable their nation-wide third-party network to adapt to rapid changes in their industry, forging stronger relationships between the bank and the wealth advisor network to reduce advisor churn and deliver better outcomes to the end customers.
Venture-building project for a new entrant in the wealth management platform market in Australia

Commercialising a secure and trusted Platform as a Service for an Australian Government business enterprise
The Digital Delivery Centre (DDC) of one of Australia’s most trusted brands built a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution with unique security and compliance features to power their e-commerce and digital trusted services. Significant investment was approved for commercialisation of the product as the client considered this to be a sizable market opportunity, specifically within its Government customer segment.
Commercialising a digital personal assistant powered by artificial intelligence for a leading Australian University
The IT division of a leading Australian University developed a number of innovative emerging tech solutions to position the University as a digital leader in the education sector; this included an AI-powered digital personal assistant.
