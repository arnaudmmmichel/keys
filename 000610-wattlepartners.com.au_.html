meta title:About — Wattle Partners
meta description:

Much of the investment and superannuation industry is centred around managing investments for the younger generations. That is, it is tilted towards investing for growth, not income. 
The ability to continue to continue saving is central to the ability to pursue growth at any cost, something utilised by advisers and industry funds alike.  And there is nothing wrong with this.
It simply doesn’t translate well to those seeking to navigate the complexities of retirement. A ‘growth at all costs’ investment strategy is fine if you have the ability to ride it out.
The challenge for retirees, however, is that once retired, you have a limited pool of capital that must last the rest of your life. 
This requires a completely different approach to managing both investments and emotions, one centred on income, resilience and managing risks.  
After several decades in the industry, directors Jamie and Drew, found two things had become obvious:
 Our skillset was best suited to providing advice solely focused on retirement.
 There is a significant lack of information and advice solely focused on what we call ‘the Golden Years’ of retirement. 
This is exacerbated by the significant size and scale of most major superannuation funds and the inability to provide truly value adding, personal advice and engagement with an ever larger member base.
The teachings of Austin Donnelly, the grandfather of the advice industry, are the foundations on which Wattle Partners has been built. As an advocate for investor rights, we share Austin’s commitment to transparent, tailored advice, delivered in a true fee-for-service manner. 
Most things about Wattle Partners, and our team, are what you would expect in any relationship, tailored advice, disciplined processes, agnostic to product and a commitment to rigorous research. 
Retirement should be the best part of your life, but too often becomes a period of uncertainty and unneeded stress.
Wattle Partners stands out due to its heritage and experience.
Our heritage comes from being one of the first and consistently self-licensed, fee-for-service advisory firms. 
Wattle Partners was originally founded by Austin Donnelly, as Donnelly Money Management in the 1970’s, and the advisory team spent many years learning his philosophies. 
Austin Donnelly was once considered the number one adviser in Australia and was well known for his push for transparency into fees and investments, dedication to improving investor rights and the importance of tailoring solutions to every person. 
Austin also founded the Australian Investor’s Association, which is a not-for-profit community of like-minded self-directed investors, with which Wattle Partners remains a supporter of today.
The Wattle tree’s golden yellow colour aligns with Wattle Partners commitment to guiding families through ‘The Golden Years’ of their lives; retirement. 
In a finance industry dominated by shades of blue, and a lack of willingness to do something different, the Wattle tree stands out.
The Wattle is also diverse, with some 1,000-recorded species, reflecting the broad range of people that come together to form our community. 
The Wattle reflects our commitment to nurturing and growing our relationship with you and your family as we support you in achieving your objectives.
Wattle Partners is aware of the positive impact it and its clients are able to have on the community and people around them. 
It is for this reason we have submitted ourselves to an extensive due diligence process to become a certified B Corporation. B Corporations are for-profit companies certified to have met a rigorous standard of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency. 
We also advise a number of foundations, including The Greenlight Foundation, which has been a long-time supporter of the following charities assisting under-privileged children around the world:
Jamie is one of the founders of Wattle Partners. Having been in the industry for more than 20 years, Jamie’s career spans the corporate and private sector, growing and building businesses across financial services. He is a deep strategic thinker with a keen focus on bringing rigour to investment advice.
Drew is one of the founders of Wattle Partners. An experienced financial and investment adviser with expertise in SMSFs and portfolio construction, he has a passion for education and writing on investments. 
With over 10 years in the Financial Planning industry and Winner of the Gwen Fletcher Memorial Award for achieving the highest score in the Certified Financial Planner® program, Renato is passionate about guiding his clients through their complex financial affairs in the simplest possible way.
Renato also holds a Master of Financial Planning, a Bachelor of Economics, a Bachelor of Commerce and is an Accredited Aged Care Professional™. 
Fatuma takes pride in building long-term relationships with her clients and equipping them with the knowledge they need to make sound financial decisions. She is also passionate about improving financial literacy and empowering women in navigating their financial pathways.
Rachana leads Wattle Partners advice and client service teams, having spent time at some of the countries’ largest financial institutions. She is an excellent communicator and keen listener when helping to identify and allay client concerns. 
Annette is an experienced Paraplanner who provides support to the Financial Advisers with strategy, financial modelling and report writing.  With 12 years industry experience, Annette believes a compliant Statement of Advice is as important as a legible document that is delivered in a professional yet simple to read format. She understands the importance of educating clients in financial literacy and believes this can be the first step to financial freedom.

No hidden fees, exotic products nor complicated strategies.
WHY DO WE GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING?
Our passion is financial education. We get out of bed with the knowledge that we can help people live more enjoyable and less stressful retirements. 
Leveraging decades of experience and our growing team, we have the confidence that we can add value, with a number of key principles driving us:
Our commitment to research and education allows you to outsource the difficult tasks and focus on your retirement, or more importantly spending time with your family; 
The highly skilled team take on the work that requires daily dedication and analysis for people who don’t have time to stay up to date; 
Our advice is focused solely on retirement, and everything that comes with it, including super, estate planning, investments and cash flow.
We focus on producing consistent and growing income, while building portfolios that are resilient against the daily whims of markets.
Our advice empowers by providing you with the tools and information to make informed decisions at times that matter.
Life doesn’t happen as you plan, so our advisers are available around the clock to provide expert guidance and reassurance. Our fees are fixed, but access to our team is unlimited.
• Retired or thinking about their transition to retirement
• Have more than $1m in investable assets
• Seeking to generate passive income from their asset base
• Hold the majority of their wealth through superannuation (generally SMSF’s); and
• Appreciate the value of professional advice.
We seek to partner with likeminded professionals who understand that good advice comes at a cost. They wish to ensure their wealth is invested in a manner that aligns with their goals and values. 
Our advice is delivered in two ways, upfront and ongoing. In both cases our aim is the same; to empower you by providing the tools to make informed decisions.
We are unable to provide specific advice on products or strategies outside of a Statement of Advice. 
The start of any new relationship involves a period of ‘getting to know’ each other and determining if we are the right fit. We then set about building a plan for your future and a base from which all future decisions can be made. This forms part of several documents which outline our recommended strategies or investments and the reasons behind each of them. The aim of these documents is to inform and empower those who seek our advice into make sound financial decisions as well as minimising the number and severity of mistakes.
The follow-on part of our advice is the ongoing management of investment portfolios across family trusts, superannuation funds and individuals. This, our Private Client Service, allows you to outsource the time consuming, labour-intensive responsibilities involved in implementing your financial strategy and investment portfolio. We provide ongoing administration and mailing house support, end of financial year and legislative change planning as well as regular ongoing investment advice.
We know Private Clients of Wattle Partners will feel comfortable knowing that someone is in their corner and remain in control of their own time. We leverage off our own experience over many decades, as well as our extensive networks and proximity to markets to provide value to our clients.
We travel regularly around Australia to meet existing and potential clients.

I + G = TR or Income + Growth = Total Return
Define the game you are playing
Don’t be the house on your base case
Whilst the manner in which we uncover, identify and analyse investment ideas is complex, our overriding philosophy is straightforward.
The data shows that asset allocation, rather than stock selection, drives a significant amount of the returns achieved over the long-term. Most importantly, a focus on asset allocation, assists in smoothing what can at times be volatile investment markets, reducing the risk of our clients making poor decisions at inopportune times. 
Central to our investment approach is the understanding that investing a finite pool of capital, as is the case in retirement, requires a significantly different approach to that applied by most advisers and managers.
It requires a focus on building resilient portfolios, that are not exposed to the whims of the market on a daily basis, and built for multiple outcomes, not for the ‘consensus’ which is regularly proven to be wrong. 
We focus on managing the cash flow needs of our clients, allowing them to invest into a balance of assets that offer both income and growth, as without the latter, a finite pool of capital will not last. 
There are no versus in our portfolios, we are agnostic to product and utilise both active and passively managed strategies. We want the asset that best expressed the preference of the Investment Committee.
The ongoing part of our advice is the ongoing management of investment portfolios across family trusts, superannuation funds and for individuals. 
This, our Private Client Service, allows you to outsource the time consuming responsibilities involved in implementing your financial strategy and investment portfolio. We provide ongoing administration and mailing house support, end of financial year and legislative change planning as well as regular ongoing investment advice.

How to build an inflation proof ASX portfolio
Director Drew Meredith joined Owen Raszkiewicz from Rask Australia on The Australian Investors podcast. 
In this episode, they walk you through what it takes to build an inflation-resistant portfolio.
Experts warn retirees to plan for higher inflation
Financial advisers are recommending retirees adopt investments that protect against inflation as rising living costs put pressure on the budgets of Australians least able to counter the falling value of money.
Rising inflation hits retirees harder than younger investors because they lack the time and income streams to offset it. Retirees are less likely to have a wage or salary that rises with inflation. 
The future of advice is institutional grade
Short-term returns are rewarded with capital flows, and with client pressure mounting on sectors like cryptocurrency, there are many reasons to throw away a long-term, cautious investment approach and do what’s easy, sell everything and go to cash.
However, if an advisory firm’s mandate, like ours, dictates guiding those nearing or in retirement to deliver sustainable, consistent, and strong income and growth, then doing so is becoming increasingly difficult. 
Big bank profit margin tipped to widen alongside higher rates
Bond yields are rising across the globe as inflationary fears balloon. While this might be bad news for bond prices and equities sensitive to inflation, it could be news good news for Australia's big banks as rising yields have historically widened interest rate margins and pushed up profits.
Drew Meredith, director and adviser at Wattle Partners agrees, saying higher bond rates typically afford banks a greater opportunity to increase their net interest margins (NIM), which are sitting near all-time lows.
Despite a growing list of concerns, the current market environment is better than many think thanks to ongoing support from central banks and governments, according to Wattle Partners.
Drew Meredith, the firm’s director, cautioned investors against succumbing to the so called “wall of worry", a term describing that often stopped investors from putting capital into the market.
How expert financial planners would manage a $2.3 million retirement
Drew Meredith and Jamie Nemtsas, certified financial planners from Wattle Partners, join Owen Rask on The Australian Investors Podcast to walk us through how they would manage the $2.3 million retirement portfolio of a fictitious couple, Fiona and Craig.
This episode is filled with great insights around portfolio construction, investment planning, investment property, retirement strategy, risk profiling, lifestyle goal setting, investment returns and more.
SMSF trustees avoid retirement income mandate
Draft legislation for the impending ‘Retirement Income Covenant’ was released this week, with SMSF trustees no doubt breathing a sigh of relief after being exempt from the new law. The change in legislation will require all APRA-regulated funds, specifically industry and corporate super plans, to develop and implement a retirement income strategy for those who are retired or nearing retirement.
Quality assets provide the best insurance
With fears of rising inflation spooking investors, it is timely to consider which equity investments can best protect against inflation’s corrosive impact.
Drew Meredith, managing director at financial planning firm Wattle Partners, favours the quality factor though all economic scenarios, including inflationary periods. ‘‘The inflation risk, in our view, is overstated, but regardless, it will drive markets in the short to medium term,’’
What is a cash management account and how do they work?
New to investing, or simply trying to streamline your finances and investment reporting? A cash management account may be one option to consider.
Cash management accounts, or CMAs, are a popular account choice for DIY investors ranging from the inexperienced, to those running their own self-managed super funds (SMSF). So, why are they popular, and what do they have to offer?

Why Telstra's latest dividend isn't as odd as it seems
Telstra maintaining its 8 cent dividend has been framed as odd due to the falling revenue the dividend accompanies, but experts have a different take.
On its face, you can understand why a maintained dividend and falling revenue may seem like an odd couple. Dividends can be barometer for a company's health, a spoil of success rewarded to investors who back the horse.
Take my advice: AMP, industry complexity spark calls for a reboot
Drew Meredith, director and adviser at Wattle Partners, agrees. He concedes conflicts of interest are endemic among most of the larger players in the Australian financial advice industry, by virtue of the fact they run in-house products and employ advisers to advise on them.
However, Meredith says this is not the case for the bulk of independent advisers. Additionally, he says any merger between IOOF and MLC is unlikely to change this landscape of conflicts.
How much risk can you handle?
Given the volatility, investors need to be more mindful than ever of how much risk they can tolerate within their portfolio. This includes deciding how much to invest across risk assets such as shares and property, and how much in lower-risk cash, says Drew Meredith, managing director at financial planning firm Wattle Partners.
“Having now experienced both the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19 meltdown, I know firsthand that clients and our team were far more prepared for the volatility than before,” Meredith says.
Two years of digital transformation in two months”: How an operations overhaul could help businesses rebound
As a business owner myself, I’ve found the COVID-19 shutdown to be an incredibly useful time to not only prepare our business for the new financial year, but for the next decade. There is nothing like being inundated with client requests, new business, and typical administration matters — while juggling family life — to bring the need for change to a head.
In those long days working from the home office it became apparent to me, as I am sure it did for many business owners, that there had to be a better way.
Will Chinese investments disappear from Australia?
“There are limited assets that fall into these sectors that remain on the ASX, many are already held by overseas investors, domestic-offshore consortiums or our own industry super funds like Australian Super or IFM investors.
“In terms of the focus on China, whilst these acquisitions get the most attention … it is actually Japanese and US companies that seem to have been the most acquisitive,” says Meredith.
“If anything, the announcement is likely to be a negative for the valuation of existing unlisted infrastructure, port and distribution network owners, as the major overseas buyers like Chinese state operated enterprises sovereign funds will be subject to more scrutiny.”
Investors hot in pursuit of ETFs
Frankly, there is a lot of hype surrounding exchange traded funds, or ETFs, says independent financial planner Drew Meredith.
But much of the exuberance is justified, he quickly adds.
"ETFs are extremely useful, particularly during periods of heightened volatility," says Meredith, a director with independent, fee-for-service financial planning firm Wattle Partners in Melbourne.
, which proved valuable when COVID-19 hit global markets hard and fast in February.
Drew Meredith, director and adviser at Wattle Partners, says there have been some surprisingly good results, especially for companies struggling the most with the coronavirus pandemic.
“Interestingly, it has been those businesses that were relying on a successful capital raising just to survive that have recovered most strongly. 
 are both up over 100 per cent and 
 is around 49 per cent [as at May 22],” said Meredith.
What every beginner needs to know about picking stocks
Now more than ever, value and price are moving in opposite directions. The back end of March clearly showed "an asset's price can diverge from its value and remain that way for an extended period of time," says Drew Meredith from Wattle Partners.
"At present, this is occurring across nearly all asset classes from bonds to equities and commodities. They may not be solely focused around valuing a company, but more so around determining the 'investability' of a company."
Value investing isn't for the faint hearted.
Australian banks run risk of retiree mutiny with dividend cuts
“High income is generally more risky and ‘sustainable growth’ looks less so at the moment, if you think in terms of total return,” says Jamie Nemtsas, director at financial advisory firm Wattle Partners. “You might be looking at a regional building company in New South Wales that has got a strong dividend on paper, but it’s going to be far better to hold something like Google that has got a massive audience, low cost of capital, great balance sheet – and you’re sacrificing some kind of regular income for a very, very strong company.”
Does 'sell in May and go away' hold true during the coronavirus crisis?
"There are too many unanswered questions with regard to COVID-19 which will likely continue to be the driver of market expectations, ahead of seasonal factors."
Investing is rarely an all or nothing situation, so rather than 'sell and go away', you may be better served by refining your portfolio.
"I would be further cleaning up portfolios in May, rather than selling out completely," says Drew Meredith from Wattle Partners.
Bonds income strategies harder to justify
Typical income strategies based on bonds became harder to justify as interest rates ground lower in the 2010s in the wake of the global financial crisis and income-seeking investors are effectively forced up the risk curve, toward corporate bonds, high-yield bonds, cash-generating real asset investments, and the share market.
What is more, according to experts, Angela Ashton, founder and director of managed account provider Evergreen Consultants, and Jamie Nemtsas, director at independent financial advisory firm Wattle Partners, the income aspect of share dividends – turbo-charged by Australia’s dividend imputation system – became a major attraction, with effective yields in the 6%–8% range readily available.
Protecting assets for the long term is the goal
Drew Meredith, director and adviser at Wattle Partners, says investors should keep cash available to take advantage of market volatility and falls in share prices of companies and other quality assets.
“The greatest opportunities arise when markets are volatile, but investors must focus on the earnings growth and earnings sources, rather than short-term price movements and valuations,” says Meredith.
ETF Securities Partner Series: Dividend cuts and COVID-19, what it means for income?
Kanish Chugh speaks with Jamie Nemtsas from Wattle Partners and Angela Ashton from Evergreen Consultants to discuss: how COVID-19 will impact dividends and yield focused ETFs and where people can look for yield in a post COVID world.
Caution urged on corona capital raising
Drew Meredith, director and adviser at Wattle Partners, is generally sceptical about rights issues, as they are often heavily tilted towards investment banks, institutions and broking houses and their clients.
“But it’s not often that the ‘world is on sale’ like this and there is no doubt some high quality businesses in need of capital for a short period of time," he says.
Why your dividends from the big four banks are under threat
Drew Meredith from Wattle Partners believes the APRA announcement is symptomatic of a trend already in motion.
"Banks are among the most well-capitalised in the world. Payout ratios were 95% in some cases, so dividends were bound to come down."
The downgrade from Fitch is also likely to have less impact than investors may think.
Covid-19 Crisis: Implications for advisers as industry super funds disappoint members
Would this be considered a bailout? Or the government underwriting industry funds?
Our business has seen a lot of potential and existing clients switch to industry funds in the past few years and so I’d go so far as saying they have been our biggest competitor. Yet, how do you compete on a playing field that isn’t level?
Microsoft Corp (MSFT): The “never sell” stock
The foundation story of Microsoft is well known, as both Bill Gates and Paul Allen created the business from their garage in 1975 as they sought to capitalise on the growth in demand for personal computers. As the story has it, both are now among the richest people in the world with $100bn and $20bn between them, along with in Paul’s case an ownership stake in both the Seattle Seahawks NFL team and the Portland Trailblazer’s NBA team.
Using digital tools to solve a financial advice crisis
As you tackle the headaches caused by COVID-19 quarantine and attempt to find new ways to add value to clients online, there are some very simple tricks and tools you can use to craft your marketing funnel and online workflow.
Your website’s home page should have a contact form or at least a very clear email/newsletter subscription form. This is where your transition begins. It’s also where your client starts his or her journey. First impressions count.
Local currency could gravitate higher over the remainder of the year. This means currency hedging makes sense for offshore investments, says Drew Meredith, managing director at financial planning firm Wattle Partners
“Once the Australian dollar moved under US60 cents, we engaged with every client to switch to hedged wherever possible. The dollar is now below historical averages and represents potential risk to those investing overseas,” says Meredith.
Covid-19 Crisis a rude awakening for industry super
Wattle Partners partner Drew Meredith told ifa that with dramatic falls already seen in some of Australia’s largest industry funds as the share market slumped over the past weeks, the government’s recently announced initiative to widen eligibility for early access to super was likely to cause further declines in industry fund performance.

We are dedicated to improving the financial literacy
TOOLS TO REVIEW YOUR PORTFOLIO AND BUILD AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY
At the beginning of every relationship, we request that you complete a detailed questionnaire in order to ensure we understand what you are looking for and are in a position to assist you. We have provided both a short and long-form questionnaire below:
From time to time we publish White Papers and E-books on specific subjects from the background to our investment philosophy to why shares are a better investment in property. Our most recent papers are available below:

How do I invest with Wattle Partners?
Wattle Partners is a financial advice and investment firm, focused solely on retirement. With a combined 40 years of experience, led by Jamie Nemtsas and Drew Meredith, Wattle focuses on guiding families and individuals through the most important period of their lives. 
Why did you start Wattle Partners?
Wattle Partners has a long history, dating back to 1971 through Austin Donnelly’s original financial planning firm, Donnelly Money Management. Holding financial advice license number one in Queensland. The business has evolved in the years since, having been founded in 2010, but both Jamie and Drew have worked together since 2005. The business was started to provide a source of education and transparent financial and investment advice to the millions of Australians that can gain value from it. Specifically, Wattle Partners is unashamedly focused on providing advice solely on those nearing or in retirement, with our experience offering a unique understanding of the emotional, financial and investment issues that must be considered.
Put simply, retirement. We live and breathe everything about retirement. Having advised hundreds of families over the year we are attuned and in the privileged position to understand both the financial, emotional and investment considerations that are most important in retirement. Most of our core principles are what you would expect of a professional, we are transparent, detailed, rigourous and most of all never receive a hidden fee. Every engagement with clients is on a fixed fee, ongoing, basis meaning there are never any surprises. We are differentiated by the fact that we know who we are, retirement specialists, and have extensive experience on all matters of investment,.  
Wattle Partners provides advice to those currently retired or in the process of transitioning and planning for retirement. Our team of advisers have experience across superannuation, investments, borrowing, entity structuring, personal insurance and estate planning. Wattle Partners also provides ongoing services including the management of investment and superannuation portfolios including all administration, paperwork, implementation and reporting required to meet your obligations as a taxpayer and trustee.
Who owns the assets if I invest with Wattle Partners?
When you invest with Wattle Partners you will always retain ownership of your assets. We cannot and will not ever trade on your assets without your authority. 
Yes, we recommend SMSFs and a large portion of our clients utilise them as their preferred superannuation account. They offer full transparency, more control and come at a fixed annual cost. According to the corporate regulator, the cost of SMSF’s is actually falling rather than rising and can be cost competitive for balances as low as $250,000. The use of an SMSF, however, is determined by your individual circumstances, objectives and the characteristics you value.
Wattle Partners is 100% owned by Drew Meredith and Jamie Nemtsas who work in and operate the business. There is no external ownership nor shareholders who are not part of the advisory team.
Yes, Wattle Partners does recommend platforms when deemed appropriate for each individual client. Technology is an important part of the financial advice process as it allows for more efficient delivery and implementation of advice. Platforms can offer an additional layer of security, cost savings, flexibility, and the ability to reduce delays in the advisory and implementation process which can add significant value. We constantly review the platforms available in the market based on cost, flexibility and performance and have no commission arrangements with any provider. For the purposes of efficiency, and given our ability to negotiate, we have a preferred platform at any given time. 
We are product agnostic. That means we will consider any investment or structure on its merits. The result is that client portfolios are tailored to their experience, preferences and risk profile. Broadly, this means they could include ASX-listed shares, exchange traded funds, managed funds and trusts. We believe both active and index-tracking strategies have a role to play within portfolios, and will simply seek to recommend the product which best represent the exposure we wsh to achieve.  
Yes, we believe managed funds offers investors exposure to a broader range of investment ideas and professional management. These include both index-tracking passive strategies and actively managed funds.  Unfortunately, there remains a significant amount of misunderstanding around managed funds, their transparency and liquidity. We understand that we cannot be the best at everything we do and seek to partner with those who are leaders in their own fields.  We understand that some markets can be inefficient and investors will always make emotional decisions, which provides opportunities for consistent outperformance over the long-term. Managed funds offer access to entire teams of well trained professionals, who are incentivised to make the best investment decisions and spend their entire career analysing them, rather than simply a few hours each week. Most importantly, we use our scale and scope to negogiate fee discounts to the benefit of our clients. 
Do you receive commissions based on what you recommend?
No, we do not receive commissions based on recommendations that we make. 
Our senior advisers all hold the highest designation in the financial advice industry, that of Certified Financial Planner and several are also SMSF Specialists. All representatives must have a Bachelor degree in a related specialty, have completed a post-graduate diploma and passed the Financial Adviser exam before they are authorised to provide advice. Jamie and Drew are both SMSF Specialist Advisors and members of the SMSF Association. Jamie, Drew, Fatuma Akalo and Renato Manias, are also ‘qualfied tax relevant providers’ meaning that are authorised to provide advice on tax matters that relate to the financial advice they provide.
Our fees are determined by the level of advice and ongoing service required. As a result, our firm works solely on a fixed fee basis, through which we provide a guaranteed minimum level of service for a fixed annual fee. These fees are seperated into tranches which are determined by the complexity of ongoing advice required, number of entities, number of external products and the type of investments preferred by each client. Our minimum ongoing fee is $15,000 excluding GST per annum, generally billed quarterly. 
Every employee of Wattle Partners receives an agreed salary and discretionary bonus. The bonus incentive is paid based on the achievement of various Key Performance Indicators. 
Who will I be advised by?
As a client of Wattle Partners, you will receive the full support of our advisory and administration teams. You will have a primary senior adviser, being Jamie Nemtsas (00100050), Drew Meredith (001001056), Fatuma Akalo (00383374) or Renato Manias (001266025). To ensure continuity of your service and relationship you will also receive the support from one or several of our client support team members including Sharni Percival, Annette Buultjens, Rachana San and Stefan Gallo.
Because we know who we are. With a combined four decades of experience, Jamie and Drew identified a lack of specialisation within the financial advice industry. Retirement is supposed to be the best time of anyone’s life but too often becomes a period of stress and uncertainty, particularly around finances and investment. At Wattle Partners, we offer something truly different; advice focused solely on those in or nearing retirement. Too often financial advisers seek to be everything to everyone, rather than focusing on those areas that match their skillset and experience, or more importantly where they can add the most value. Much like medical professionals, the team at Wattle are laser-focused on both the investment and emotional impacts of retirement, which are significantly different than at every other stage of one’s life. At Wattle Partners, you know what you get, and more importantly, you gain access to the experience of advising hundreds of retired families over the years.
Do you do your own research?
Yes, Wattle Partners has its own Investment Committee. The sole focus of the Investment Committee is on determining the most appropriate asset allocation and selection of investments for you. The Investment Committee also includes principals from Atchison Consultants, an asset consulting firm that Jamie and Drew also own. This group provides consulting advice to large superannuation funds, non-profits on regulatory and investment requirements, while also guiding the investments of other major financial advisory firms. We also invest a substantial amount of capital in subscribing to various investment research providers including Bloomberg, Reuters, Morgan’s, Morningstar, Lonsec, Bell Potter, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. In a typical week our investment team will meet with 5 to 10 different managers, economists, syndicates or conferences to ensure we remain informed and aware of all opportunities available at any given time. 
Where do your ideas come from?
Our ideas come from a diverse range of sources including meetings with company managements, investment managers, institutions, research reports, trade conferences and our clients. We have an enviable network of contacts throughout the global investment and family office industry, afforded by our association with The Inside Network and The Principal’s Community, which are networks of leading financial advisers.
How do I become a client?
We aim to make the process as straightforward as possible. On contacting Wattle Partners you will receive an email detailing this process in more detail, along with providing a copy of our Financial Services Guide and Privacy Policy, both important legal documents. We will then contact you for an initial discussion to determine if we are each the right fit for each other, at which point we will ask you to complete a confidential fact finding questionnaire. Upon receipt, we will arrange a more formal meeting to discuss your objectives in receiving financial advice, and subsequent provide a quotation for a statement of advice or SOA. The minimum cost of this SOA is $5,500 including GST. Within this SOA you will receive a proposal for our ongoing, comprehensive, private client services.
As a client of Wattle Partners, you should expect a tailored and highly responsive relationship. The advice you receive will be supported by detailed reasoning about its appropriateness for you and your family ensuring you have an educated and informative experience. In terms of investments, we seek to partner with the best managers and investment experts in the world to deliver consistent returns regardless of the market environment, with a particular focus on resilience. You should not expect daily phone calls or regular trading on your portfolio, we are long-term investors who understand that true returns are only achieved through sustained exposure to investment markets and asset allocation. All we ask of you is to be responsive when we are in contact with you.
How do I invest with Wattle Partners?
Depending on the level of service required, clients can choose the level of involvement they desire. Some clients wish to have an active role in decisions being made such as asset allocation, while others prefer to outsource investment decisions to our in-house advisory team. This service is tailored towards clients that do not have a strong knowledge of investment markets, portfolio construction, experience with investing, or simply lack the time to manage their financial affairs effectively.
We travel regularly around Australia to meet existing and potential clients.

Unconventional Wisdom Journal — Wattle Partners
Unconventional Wisdom - A journal of unique insights from experienced financial advisers
Our focus at Wattle Partners isn’t solely on providing financial and investment advice, but also on promoting financial literacy and improving the investment education standards in Australia. It is for this reason we publish the Unconventional Wisdom Journal (UWJ) and website. 
UWJ is focused on providing investors of all levels of experience with the tools to review their portfolio and build an investment strategy, as well as to identify new and attractive investments for the future.
Active v passive reimagined: When imperfect is perfect
Has there been a better time for retirees to invest?
While most of the financial press focus on the impact of inflation on the cost of living, or falling asset prices, particularly residential property, due to the increase in interest rates used to combat this, the headlines are missing the biggest message of all.
Bringing performance into context after a shocking 2022
Where did it all go wrong?
Having experienced one of the more chaotic periods for financial market in at least decade, investors could have been forgiven for thinking 2022 would be a little less eventful than years past.
The one sector that had protected returns from global equity markets in an eventful 2022 was technology, with the likes of Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple, continuing to power ahead, or at least hold their ground in the face of significant risk…
Global sharemarkets looked to have bottomed in June as markets began to digest the implications of the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary policy action. Comments from Governor Jerome Powell during the annual Jackson Hole Summit reversed the recent positive trend as he all but denied growing expectations that the central bank would be forced to cut rates in 2023 or 2024 if the economy slows as expected.
The true value of advice is in avoiding mistakes
The value of advice is one of the hottest topics in finance right now. Successive governments have effectively strangled the demand side of the financial advice market, through layers of red tape and compliance, to the point that financial advice is now borderline unaffordable for many.
The RBA has continued to deliver what the central bank itself said just 12 months ago would never happen, increasing interest rates by 50 basis points in July and August. Despite Australia being among the most sensitive economies to movements in interest rates and bond yields, the cash rate has now moved to 1.85 per cent, seeing a near doubling in mortgage repayments for those who borrowed in 2020 and 2021.
What is really in the S&P/ASX 200 Index?
The S&P/ASX 200 Index, often referred to as the ASX 200, is considered to be one of the benchmark Australian indexes. It forms the basis of the fourth and fifth most popular exchange-traded funds on the market and is commonly used by fund managers to measure their relative performance.
What to watch for in portfolios amid a year of change
The latter half of 2021 and the majority of 2022 have been among the most challenging periods for investors in several decades. The traditional balanced portfolio, defined as one that holds 40 per cent of assets in government bonds and 60 per cent in indexed equities, is on track for the sixth-worst beginning to a year in the last century.
Just when it looked like the market selloff was complete and investors had fully ‘repriced’ businesses based on a significantly higher bond yield and cost of capital, volatility shifted into another gear in June. Even those sectors that had performed well thus far in 2022, being energy and materials reversed gains, the former only modestly, down 0.3 per cent, and the latter more than 12 per cent.
What to watch for in portfolios amid a year of change
The latter half of 2021 and the majority of 2022 have been among the most challenging for investors in several decades. The traditional balanced portfolio, defined as one that holds 40 per cent of assets in government bonds and 60 per cent in indexed equities, is on track for one of the sixth-worst beginnings to a year in the last century.
To buy or not to buy
At our core, almost every investor feels like a contrarian at some point in time. It is only natural to see value in something that has fallen significantly in a short period of time. And to be honest, I must have considered buying the leveraged Nasdaq ETF at least 10 times in the last few months as the tech sector fell into another bear market.
What to watch for when considering new investments?
The internet and data age has led to a proliferation of information being available to every investor from the experienced to the firsttimer. This has seen a spike in finance and investment scams but also both high- and lowquality investment opportunities being made available directly to consumers, passing the due diligence risk to the buyer.
May was all about the Federal Election, as another three years expired, and Australian’s went to voting booths again. In the end, the betting odds and polls were extremely accurate, with the Australian Labour Party regaining Government for the first time in nine years.
Inflation, inflation, inflation (and interest rates). These were the only topics that mattered in April if you focused on the headlines. This despite extended lockdowns in China, war between Ukraine and Russia and an expanding energy crisis.
Why bailing out could cost you your retirement
Whilst global sharemarkets have recovered much of the ground lost due to the Ukraine crisis, US Federal Reserve moves and surging energy costs, there is a general feeling that equities remain on the precipice of a bear market or extended correction.
Minimum pension reduction offers opportunity for growth
Among the Federal Budget proposals that received the least fanfare was the extension of the ‘temporary’ relief on the minimum drawdowns for account-based pensions. Whilst the media attention on the legislative change immediately highlights the fact that it benefits the wealthy more than the rest, it affords an entire generation of Australians greater flexibility.
Crowded trades and the challenge of volatility 
One of the more interesting and powerful implications of the pandemic, relating to investment markets at least, is the velocity at which every new piece of news or data is priced-into markets. We only need to look back at the events of March and April 2020 to be reminded that we experienced both the fastest fall and recovery in sharemarkets the space of just a few weeks.
Everything you need to know about bonds
Bond yields have become one of the biggest and most important talking points within investment markets in 2022. At their most simple, bonds and the interest or yields they offer, represents the so-called risk-free rate off which every other asset class in the world is priced.
What’s the difference between an on and off market buy back?
Buybacks have been all the rage in last the few years. Triggered by the availability and low cost of capital, US-listed companies, in particular, have embraced the strategy with great gusto. The idea is quite simple; if you have excess cash in your company, why not buy back your own shares, in effect “investing in yourself?”

No hidden fees, exotic products nor complicated strategies.
WHY DO WE GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING?
Our passion is financial education. We get out of bed with the knowledge that we can help people live more enjoyable and less stressful retirements. 
Leveraging decades of experience and our growing team, we have the confidence that we can add value, with a number of key principles driving us:
Our commitment to research and education allows you to outsource the difficult tasks and focus on your retirement, or more importantly spending time with your family; 
The highly skilled team take on the work that requires daily dedication and analysis for people who don’t have time to stay up to date; 
Our advice is focused solely on retirement, and everything that comes with it, including super, estate planning, investments and cash flow.
We focus on producing consistent and growing income, while building portfolios that are resilient against the daily whims of markets.
Our advice empowers by providing you with the tools and information to make informed decisions at times that matter.
Life doesn’t happen as you plan, so our advisers are available around the clock to provide expert guidance and reassurance. Our fees are fixed, but access to our team is unlimited.
• Retired or thinking about their transition to retirement
• Have more than $1m in investable assets
• Seeking to generate passive income from their asset base
• Hold the majority of their wealth through superannuation (generally SMSF’s); and
• Appreciate the value of professional advice.
We seek to partner with likeminded professionals who understand that good advice comes at a cost. They wish to ensure their wealth is invested in a manner that aligns with their goals and values. 
Our advice is delivered in two ways, upfront and ongoing. In both cases our aim is the same; to empower you by providing the tools to make informed decisions.
We are unable to provide specific advice on products or strategies outside of a Statement of Advice. 
The start of any new relationship involves a period of ‘getting to know’ each other and determining if we are the right fit. We then set about building a plan for your future and a base from which all future decisions can be made. This forms part of several documents which outline our recommended strategies or investments and the reasons behind each of them. The aim of these documents is to inform and empower those who seek our advice into make sound financial decisions as well as minimising the number and severity of mistakes.
The follow-on part of our advice is the ongoing management of investment portfolios across family trusts, superannuation funds and individuals. This, our Private Client Service, allows you to outsource the time consuming, labour-intensive responsibilities involved in implementing your financial strategy and investment portfolio. We provide ongoing administration and mailing house support, end of financial year and legislative change planning as well as regular ongoing investment advice.
We know Private Clients of Wattle Partners will feel comfortable knowing that someone is in their corner and remain in control of their own time. We leverage off our own experience over many decades, as well as our extensive networks and proximity to markets to provide value to our clients.
We travel regularly around Australia to meet existing and potential clients.

I + G = TR or Income + Growth = Total Return
Define the game you are playing
Don’t be the house on your base case
Whilst the manner in which we uncover, identify and analyse investment ideas is complex, our overriding philosophy is straightforward.
The data shows that asset allocation, rather than stock selection, drives a significant amount of the returns achieved over the long-term. Most importantly, a focus on asset allocation, assists in smoothing what can at times be volatile investment markets, reducing the risk of our clients making poor decisions at inopportune times. 
Central to our investment approach is the understanding that investing a finite pool of capital, as is the case in retirement, requires a significantly different approach to that applied by most advisers and managers.
It requires a focus on building resilient portfolios, that are not exposed to the whims of the market on a daily basis, and built for multiple outcomes, not for the ‘consensus’ which is regularly proven to be wrong. 
We focus on managing the cash flow needs of our clients, allowing them to invest into a balance of assets that offer both income and growth, as without the latter, a finite pool of capital will not last. 
There are no versus in our portfolios, we are agnostic to product and utilise both active and passively managed strategies. We want the asset that best expressed the preference of the Investment Committee.
The ongoing part of our advice is the ongoing management of investment portfolios across family trusts, superannuation funds and for individuals. 
This, our Private Client Service, allows you to outsource the time consuming responsibilities involved in implementing your financial strategy and investment portfolio. We provide ongoing administration and mailing house support, end of financial year and legislative change planning as well as regular ongoing investment advice.
We hope Private Clients of Wattle Partners feel comfortable knowing that someone is in their corner and remain in control of their own time. We leverage off our own experience over many decades, as well as our extensive networks and proximity to markets to provide value to our clients.
