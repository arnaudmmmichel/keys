Be Collective has enabled us to smooth out our volunteering recruitment process by utilising one platform to manage all of our volunteering opportunities across the island of Ireland. Managing all aspects on a safe and secure platform gives us more time to focus our energy on supporting volunteers in their roles which in turn helps us towards achieving our goals and overall mission as an organisation.

Together, we are building a platform and engaging communities to make the world a better place.
So what are we all about?
Be Collective is social infrastructure. It is designed to mobilise our collective goodwill as individuals, organisations, schools, community groups, charities and governments. It reconceives how we collaborate and connect to make a difference; capture and share data on social impact; and recognise and celebrate the contribution of volunteers individually and collectively. 
Practically, Be Collective provides innovative tools to deliver a networked volunteer, event and project management system, a verified Social Record for every volunteer, new data on volunteer pathways into study and employment, and dynamic aggregated social impact reporting. All these features are designed to revolutionise the sector and harness and direct our collective goodwill for the greatest possible impact.
Be Collective has invested heavily in building our platform over the last four years. As Be Collective makes itâs way across the globe, we continue to pioneer world class community infrastructure; aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, enhancing insights into building social capital, engaging children, gamifying goodwill and building pathways from volunteering. Due to our growth and development, we are now looking for dynamic talented people who can contribute, share our vision and drive to build social infrastructure to create a movement of global goodwill. 
Look through our opportunities above and if it sounds like a good fit, weâd love to hear from you.
