"AirShaper helped us keep expenses low while still getting amazing CFD work done FAST."
"With Airshaper we could vastly increase our frequency of iterations. We ran more than 100 simulations per month per person and pretty much no onboarding to the tool was needed!"
Constantin Jung, Team Lead Mechanical Engineering & Aerodynamics
"With AirShaper allowed us to take Aerodynamics Performance to the next level. The wingles on the F3 RR where optimized for maximum downforce using their shape optimization software!"

There are clearly quite a few good reasons to focus on renewable wind energy. And with most of the accessible windy spots on land already spoken for, the vast open area of the seas are today's big opportunity - offshore wind energy. With strong & predictable winds, undisturbed by any trees or buildings nearby, it's a dream for anyone building a business case.
Lamborghini's are fast, really fast. There are those who are happy with a base Lamborghini Gallardo. And then there are those who make them even faster. In the highly competitive scene of 1-mile drag racing, an undisclosed customer turned to state-of-the-art technology to gain the edge.
The breaking glass during the unveiling of the Tesla Cybertruck wasn't the only shock: the exterior design completely breaks with the hyper-streamlined styling of the other Tesla models. As aerodynamics is the dominant factor for the range of electric vehicles, we wanted to find out what was playing.

The role of CFD in passing aircraft EASA regulations
Certifying an aircraft to meet EASA regulations requires comprehensive testing programmes, but Computational Fluid Dynamics CFD has now become an integral part of this certification process.

Aerodynamics strongly affects the top speed of an object, whether that be a runner, cyclist, motorcycle, car or aircraft. This article explains why and shares insight into the tactics different industries use to exploit aerodynamics to maximise speed.

In this video, weâ€™ll be looking at how to speed up the aerodynamic design process by working directly with open surface models!
First a few words on solid versus surface models.
In engineering, most 3D models are designed just like they are machined in real life: you start from a solid block and take away the excess material until you have the desired shape. Itâ€™s still solid on the inside and there are no gaps between the different outside surfaces.
In design or styling, however, 3d models are often built as a combination of complex surfaces: you start for example from a simple rectangular plane, which has two sides. Then you start pushing & pulling the different vertices on that plane until the shape looks good. To obtain the full 3D model, multiple surfaces are put together, sometimes overlapping, sometimes with gaps in between.
Now when it comes to aerodynamics simulations, it is typically required to work away all the gaps & interferences, to obtain something that is called a watertight or manifold 3D  model. In case of surface models, this often means weeks of model fixing to obtain a 3D file that is ready for simulation.
A trick to avoid remodeling is to use a wrapping method, which will literally wrap a closed surface around your model. But this can be quite tricky, as you may end up losing small details or closing holes & small gaps that werenâ€™t supposed to be closed, like ventilation holes in a helmet for example.
The only proper way to avoid risky wrapping methods or weeks of remodeling is to accept the surface models as they are by treating every surface like a wall on both sides. Thatâ€™s exactly what we do at AirShaper â€“ we tuned our algorithms for months to make them work directly with open surface models. Let me show you an example of how this speeds up the aerodynamic design process:
Auto Access is a company that develops & installs auto accessories, like for example hardtops for pickup trucks. In the light of more demanding emission regulations, they asked us to assess the impact on fuel consumption of adding a hard top to the Nissan NP300 pickup truck.
As you can imagine, Nissan doesnâ€™t simply hand out their confidential 3D data. So instead we turned to a professional website for 3D car models. And as you may have guessed, these are all surface models with plenty of gaps and holes.
So instead of closing all these holes, which would have required more budget and time, we just uploaded the model straight into AirShaper. Every surface was treated as a real wall on both sides. And although air leaked to the inside in some locations, these static pockets of air didnâ€™t affect the overall behavior of the flow.
The result? Just a day after obtaining the 3D model, we were looking at the aerodynamic report. And the best news? Adding a hardtop to the Nissan NP300 doesnâ€™t increase fuel consumption!

The AirShaper videos cover the basics of aerodynamics (aerodynamic drag, drag & lift coefficients, boundary layer theory, flow separation, reynolds number...), simulation aspects (computational fluid dynamics, CFD meshing, ...) and aerodynamic testing (wind tunnel testing, flow visualization, ...).
We then use those basics to explain the aerodynamics of (race) cars (aerodynamic efficiency of electric vehicles, aerodynamic drag, downforce, aero maps, formula one aerodynamics, ...), drones and airplanes (propellers, airfoils, electric aviation, eVTOLS, ...), motorcycles (wind buffeting, motogp aerodynamics, ...) and more!
