We are ADS Insight, an independent, B Corp certified, EU public affairs consultancy with more than 20 years of experience. We have two complementary business strands that 1) bridge the business and policy interface and 2) bridge the science and policy interface. As facilitators of dialogue, we offer EU policy advisory and government relations services, including support on EU funding applications. We are also organisers of events and large science-based congresses.
We are a boutique consultancy, meaning we operate as a small family-like business with strong values and a commitment to work alongside organisations who think like we do.
Our job, geared towards Advocacy, Dialogue and Sustainability (A-D-S), is to help companies and organisations understand EU regulations that affect their activities. We help them contribute to the processes that shape those regulations, and improve legislation so that sustainable policies are created to protect people, the planet and global economic prosperity.

ADS Insight through the years | ADS Insight
ADS Insight was founded in 2001. The early years were typical for a start-up: we were driven by our ideas and had a youthful spirit. We found a strong niche in maritime policy and in the transport sector in general, and were prepared and ready for the new environmental standards. We had energy and we loved our job. And this showed. Logistics, administrative processes and personnel management proved to be major challenges, but with patience, agility and versatility, we embraced the steep learning curve and found solutions.
With a strong foundation laid, the company grew both in breadth and depth. Our core activities were expanded into new policy areas including circular economy and health, and plans to establish branch offices in Germany, Sweden and Poland were put in place.   We started looking for what makes us unique. In our growth years, we focused on both the work and the team. In this way, our company became a friendly place to be and work, and we developed a unique company culture based on excellence AND friendliness. Sharing the same values became extremely important when compiling our client portfolio.
Inspired by the book by Jim Collins entitled âGood to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Jumpâ, founder Aida Bakri understood that ADS Insight had the ability and potential to be a âGreatâ company. At 10, this leap was manifesting itself visibly through recognition from policymakers and consistent acknowledgement from clients. The question arose: what could we do with this greatness? With this realisation, a new approach to business began to take shape. We took time to invest in pro-bono work, volunteering and delivering impact to society and the planet.
We confidently accepted assignments to support non-profit organisations, such as the Sea Alarm Foundation, Syriana (a football club for refugees in Belgium), Adopt A Midwife (a training programme for midwives in Ethiopia) and the Climate Resilience Execution Agency of Dominica, to cite just a few. We also supported the establishment of the LadyAgri Impact Investment Hub, supporting women in agribusiness in Sub-Saharan Africa and Small Island Developing States. Driven by the UN SDGs, ADS insight decided to step up and play a role in achieving the goals by 2030 and giving back to society.
                            In 2019, founder Aida Bakri gave a 
TEDx talk on Empowering Women and Youth to Embrace Social Entrepreneurship 
. The same year, Aida was selected by the women empowerment organisation, the Vital Voices Global Partnership to join the organisation as a mentee under the Global Ambassadors Programme. Today she is also a judge and trainer on SDG Storytelling and Communications for the Vital Voices WE Empower Programme.
Although 2020 was to be a bright and prosperous year, many opportunities fell away due to the COVID pandemic. We had just moved into our new offices in the heart of the EU Quarter and yet we were confined and house-bound until the pandemic receded.
Despite our challenges and great fears, our big pivot came in December 2020 when we were invited to host the Secretariat of an independent scientific group, the European Scientific Working Group on Influenza and other acute respiratory viruses. Given we had already built an expertise in EU health policy, we were well-placed. And this new assignment brought with it a range of new services that we could add to our portfolio. So, in addition to our EU public affairs activities, we expanded our services to communicating science and reinforcing the science-policy interface, particularly in the field of pandemic preparedness and response. We added on the ability to organise large-scale scientific conferences, webinars, podcasts and more. Sustainability became the red thread through all our activities.
In 2022, ADS Insight reached a new height by officially becoming a B Corporation. Having successfully passed the B Corp certification and becoming a B Corp means that we have committed to putting purpose over profit, and we have committed to using business as force for good. With this certification we are striving to bring impact into everything we do and to document our progress. We aim to inspire other businesses and make improvements year on year in the B Corp model of continuous improvement.
Our main message: if we can do it, you can do it, too!

meta title:BCorp Journey | ADS Insight
meta description:Follow our BCorp Journey.

In a way, ADS Insightâs journey to become a BÂ Corp began in 2001, when the company was first created. From day one, our Managing Director and Founder, Aida Bakri, has been guiding and inspiring the whole ADS team to take a stand for a better, more equitable and sustainable world.
It was not until 2020 however that we decided to apply to be a BÂ Corp certified company. We saw this as a big challenge, but also a great opportunity. We knew the process would be arduous , but this was our chance to join a community of like-minded companies, and signal to all our stakeholders that we want to use business as a force for good.
Completing the B Impact Assessment was a particularly challenging task, but a great learning opportunity. It took over 200 hours to respond to the 200+ questions of the assessment, covering in detail how our company functions, and what we do to be environmentally and socially sustainable. We also had to amend the company by-laws, to enshrine a legal requirement to consider the impact of our decisions on all of our stakeholders. Finally, we had to go through a rigorous audit to verify all our answers. Overall, this long process may have been strenuous, but we consider it to be well worth it: it is what gives the BÂ Corp certification all of its value, and we are very proud to have made it through.
Indeed, in the end, and with the precious help of Andrea Bury, our helpful B-Leader, we finally got the good news on 9 September 2022 : with a final score of 81.6, ADS Insight made it to the finish line and we are now officially a certified BÂ Corp! We proudly join the ranks of Patagonia, Coursera, Rituals and many others - who have paved the way for us and shown the world that it is possible to use business as a force for good.
However, our journey is only beginning. Now that we are part of this vibrant community of impactful companies, we will strive to reinforce our impact through continuous improvement and we will be audited again in 3 years, and obligated to raise our score.
In the meantime, we are  already bringing in some new protocols. For example, we are now formally offering our employees the possibility to use a few hours of work time for volunteering. We have identified a few causes weâd most like to associate with. We have also joined the Interdependence Coalition, where we make use of our expertise in public affairs to help ensure that, as was proposed by the European Commission, we enhance the governing principles that determine how directors of companies address their significant impact on people and the planet.
Our dynamic team at ADS Insight have many other ideas about how to honour our new status as a BÂ Corp. Watch this space!

Supporting local artists at the Vernissage, annual reception of ADS Insight
At ADS Insight we have made it a point to use our position to turn every event into something meaningful. The idea of combining our annual end-of-year reception with a Vernissage for an artist has been a mutually rewarding experience for our guests, ourselves and the artist. Over the years, we have welcomed close to 20 artists, photographers, and jewelry designers to exhibit in our offices. Often, we matched every purchase of art with a donation to a charity.
 is an American international, not-for-profit, and non-governmental organisation that works with women leaders in the areas of economic empowerment, women’s political participation, and human rights. Vital Voices is headquartered in Washington D.C.
ADS Insight came into contact with Vital Voices in 2019 when founder Aida Bakri, was selected as a mentee of the Vital Voices and Bank of America Global Ambassadorsâ Programme. She was matched with the phenomenal woman entrepreneur, Norah Casey, and the empowerment received can simply not be measured. In order to pay it forward, ADS Insight has been actively engaged in promoting the activities of Vital Voices and fully supports its mission.  Furthermore, Aida has been a judge and trainer on the Vital Voices WE Empower programme since 2020.
ADS Insight also encourages all staff to engage in mentoring which is a key component in the empowerment of women and girls.

As a Norwegian citizen, having spent several years living abroad she takes a special interest in the EUâs unique relationships with states outside the Union through the EEA, EFTA and other bilateral agreements. Being from a small country, she enjoys learning more about Norwayâs role on the international arena. As such, she often handles the âNorwegianâ aspects of ADS work, particularly related to researching and drafting studies related to Norway.
Ingeborg speaks English fluently and has a working knowledge of the languages of her Scandinavian neighbors, Denmark and Sweden. She is also hoping to develop her French and Spanish skills in the years to come.
