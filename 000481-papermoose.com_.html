Tree parenthood - felix mobile - Paper Moose | B Corp Creative Agency in Sydney
Our job was to shift felix mobile from being seen as the greenest plan (values) to being seen as the most fulfilling plan (value + values) and as result, steal away some customers from other telco brands with little to no green credentials.
So, with the help of dozens of mischievous, animated baby trees, this fun-filled campaign showed everyone how your mobile plan can make the world a better place…and you the proud parent of a baby tree, or dozens.
More than any other, this is an age of sustainability. When it comes to doing your part for the planet, people expect more of the brands they spend money with. With this in mind, our challenge was to get people to think of felix mobile as the mobile plan that lets them have more, and give more back.
You’d be hard pressed to find a telco that doesn’t bark about value, so we decided to lean on our point of difference - planting one tree for every month a customer is on a felix mobile plan - and present it in a distinctive, memorable way. This is a plan with a bigger plan. To offer a simple, great value mobile plan, while contributing to something bigger, our planet.
felix mobile plant one tree for every month you’re on their mobile plan, which technically makes you a tree parent. To make sure our campaign took root in Aussie minds, we decided to take that thought quite literally and create dozens of baby, animated trees.
This made for a bunch of fun, distinctive felix mobile content, which we could easily branch out across different platforms. The range of characters and scenarios meant there was no limit to how far we could take the adventures of ‘Luke-alyptus’ and his leafy siblings.

I love money - Australian Ethical - Paper Moose | B Corp Creative Agency in Sydney
This edgy, attitude-packed campaign worked to educate Australians that it's OK to love money, when it's invested ethically. We wanted to let people know that every Australian has the opportunity to build a healthy nest egg and contribute to a healthy planet too. All it takes is a little heart.
The great street poet Christopher Wallace may have had a point. After all, money has always been considered the root of all evil. It was our job to find a way to remind everyone money can be a force for good too.
Moving from ‘The heart of investing’ to ‘Invest with heart’, gives us a call to action to consumers, making it more about AE in their lives, than the brand just talking about themselves (just as people who talk about themselves too much are dull, it’s also dull when brands do it).
In a sea of super funds, we wanted to make sure this campaign - and its message - stood out. To do that, we introduced the world to four larger than life characters, each with an unapologetic love for money, but for surprisingly ethical reasons.
This made for a distinctive, fun TV ad, and some striking OOH executions which we think will appeal to the growing number of Australians who want to invest their money - and super - ethically.

Don't Be a Tosser - EPA - Paper Moose | B Corp Creative Agency in Sydney
How do you get people to do good things when they already think they are? That was the problem faced by EPA, who had great brand recall from their “Hey Tosser” campaign, but little actual behaviour change. Lots of people were littering, but at the same time, there were no actual litterers. Time to hold up a mirror to our audience.
We created a world where discarded litter came back and stuck itself to you if it wasn’t properly thrown in the bin, even chasing you across a whole park if you tried to run away. Reinforced by the tag “If it’s not in the bin, it’s on you”, this physically and verbally tied the responsibility of litter to its owner.
Research shows that negative, finger-wagging campaigns generate less behaviour change and that audiences find such creative approaches less engaging. By allowing us to recognise ourselves as the litterer, rather than seeing the litterer persecuted, the humorous approach gave audiences space to engage with the creative and realise they might be part of the problem… which they were.
While our initial campaign was broadly successful, the millennials segment needed to be more sticky. We took the opportunity, with the second media push, to develop an animated campaign building on the “it’s on you” narrative. Millennials can’t resist cute angry animated animals. They just can’t.
Our “Don’t Be a Tosser” campaign smashed its targets, showing that innovative, humorous approaches can get audiences on board even when something is being demanded of them. Getting the audience to realise they were the target audience, part of the problem, and therefore part of the solution, was achieved as the number of people self-identifying as litterers rose dramatically. All without having to lift and wag a single finger.

In an industry with a talent crisis, surely we need to start fostering a culture of constructive feedback. We have an undercurrent of poor mental health too, which is only exacerbated by this issue. Isn’t it time we start building each other up instead of tearing each other down?
Recently, the experience of judging Award School offered me an interesting revelation: when everyone is influenced by the same cultural touchstones, we all end up thinking alike. 
Figuring out whether a website needs a cookie consent banner or privacy policy has always been a confusing question for me. The answer is actually pretty simple and, mercifully for people who hate cookie consent popups, not all bad news.
