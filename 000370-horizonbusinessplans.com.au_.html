Our mission is to help environmentally conscious businesses
to access the support and funding they need to amplify their positive impact.
The world is facing ever-increasing environmental challenges - from climate change, to pollution, to biodiversity loss. We want to be part of the solution to these challenges so that future generations can enjoy all that nature brings.
We believe that small businesses are uniquely positioned to use their agility, innovation and passion to make the world a better place by combining profit and purpose. Helping businesses that are working towards this regenerative goal is what bounces us out of bed every morning.
Hi, my name is Andrew Wilson, the founder of
Horizon Business Plans. The story of why I started the business has three parts.
PART 1:  I've always loved the outdoors and being out in nature - hiking, camping, scouts, you name it, I just loved it. It's what led me to studying environmental biology at uni - learning super interesting things like tropical ecosystem ecology and marine conservation.
PART 2: The other part of my undergrad double degree was Commerce and when the time came to hunt for a job as a graduate, I landed at a major bank, where I spent  12 years.
PART 3: Undertaking an MBA specialising in Social Impact in 2019, I discovered a whole new world of social enterprise, where both profit and purpose are blended to harness the power of business as a for good.
This opened my eyes to an opportunity... to combine my environmental background with my banking experience and help other businesses to do more good for the world.
Horizon Business Plans was created with the purpose of helping businesses that help the planet. Together we can create a positive impact.
