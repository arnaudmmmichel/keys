Except the fact, that I don‚Äôt got any delivery link the delivery was super easy. Everything arrived as told me.
Besides that, we are super happy with the quality of the shirts, the embroidery and the print on the back. Thank you for everything and your fast replies and help. Very happy with the whole process! Will definitely order our next merch on your website.
Thanks for your feedback Jonas! Can't wait to work again together :) 
Absolutely delighted with my order from‚Ä¶
Absolutely delighted with my order from Merchery! The bags are of exceptional quality and they look absolutely gorgeous. The entire shopping experience was top-notch. I highly recommend Merchery for their outstanding products and service!
Thank you Daniel! We're super happy to read this lovely comment :-) We hope your clients will love the bags as much as you do ü§©
Merchery was able to accommodate the custom requests for my order and still deliver on time. I was quite nervous about it all coming together but the customer support was not only assuring but followed through.
Hi Nina, thank you for the review. We're delighted that our customer success team was able to assist you to the best of their abilitiesü§©
Brilliant Company, great customer service and nice products. everything went smoothly and were more than happy with our order!
Our first super cool Merchandise Collection
We have realised the first merchandise collection for our beach club and are very happy with the result. Our customers love the shirts, Sweatshirts and bags that we created with Merchery and the first batch sold out in no time. 
The quality of the products is great and just as we had hoped. The customer service is first class, fast, personal and reliable. We are very excited about all the new customisable products and will order again.
Thank you for this lovely review Merle! Happy to read that your customers love your merch! Looking forward to work together again! 
When I requested a detailed offer, I got a reply within a couple of hours. We were then able to modify the offer to our specific needs. Delivery was quicker then expected! The products are of good quality and nicely printed.
Happy to read that you had a great experience with us! Thanks and till next time :) 
Rarely experienced such poor customer service
Rarely experienced such poor customer service. The first order was sent multiple times to the wrong delivery address. There was progress only when you complained. The customer service then insinuates bad behavior when you clearly say how bad the service is. Ordered once and never again!
We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with our service and the difficulties you faced with your order. Your experience does not meet our standards, and for that, we're genuinely sorry.
We understand the importance of timely and accurate deliveries. Your feedback is invaluable to us as it helps us learn and grow, and we assure you that we take these matters very seriously.
We're actively addressing the issues you've highlighted to prevent such situations in the future. If you reconsider, we'd appreciate the opportunity to make it right.
Excellent client relationship, we didn't know what to chose and Juan was very helpful in his advices. Also, we were on very tight deadlines and he went above and beyond to help us get the goodies for our special event. 
thanks a lot !!! definitely recommend.
Happy to read that you had a great experience with our team! We always do our best to make our clients happy! Till next time ‚òÄÔ∏è
We ordered the navy cap light for our corporate anniversary celebration. The caps were of excellent quality, of breathable fabric, and the embroidered logo was really well done. We'd recommend Merchery to anyone looking for good quality merch for their corporate events. 
Everyone at our office loved them! And as a bonus, they were useful to protect ourselves from the Sun (without overheating our heads as the material was very light).
Nathalie and the team were GREAT
Nathalie and the team were GREAT! My team is VERY particular and sometimes that can be met with businesses being annoyed with us ( which is fair LOL) but they were LOVELY! Our customized backpacks were so nice and they gave us many, many, check ins along the way! They also included detailed images of our products to approve, switch, and update throughout the process. I will be using them again in the future.
Thank you Kandra <3 Looking forward to work with you again in the future! 
Merchery has a great catalogue with curated brands. 
We were able to identify exactly what was right for our brand.
The follow-up by the team was perfect.
My experience working with Merchery was great! 10 out of 10
My experience working with Merchery couldn‚Äôt have been better! They were always friendly and ready to help even though we had short deadlines. The products arrived two weeks before expected and of great quality. 
I am looking forward to future project so I can work we Merchery again.
Thank you Anamaria. Aslo a pleasure to work with you! See you soon for future collaborations ‚òÄÔ∏è
For a client event we needed some cool and original gadgets. It was important to think sustainable. We already heard a lot of good things about Merchery so we gave it a go. 
The moment I requested some prices, I got in contact with Arend. He was very friendly and proactive, came up with ideas I wouldn't think about myself. We ended up with these nice steel corkscrews and beautiful caps with logo. The client was super happy and so were we. Thanks¬†Merchery for having a great experience, good service and¬†fast¬†delivery!
Happy to read you had a nice experience with Arend and Merchery! Looking forward to working with you again!‚òÄÔ∏è
The team at Merchery made ordering cool, custom products a breeze. Not only does the selection of products sets them apart but their customer service was unlike other companies I've worked with. We'll definitely be working with them again!
Thank you Chelsea for the amazing review, and we can't wait to work with you again soon! ‚òÄÔ∏è
We made an order for all the consultants of the agency! Sweatshirt, small patagonia down jackets, water bottles and mugs, all personalized with our logo! 
Perfect customer service, perfect delivery and the teams are delighted! 
Thank you Merchery! New order coming soon!
Thank you Ruben, always a pleasure to collaborate with your team ‚ö°Ô∏è
We're very happy with our Merchery orders. Great hands-on service. The quality of the products is top and delivery on-time. The fact that the products are sustainable is very important for us so we'll definitely continue to order our merchandising at Merchery.
Thank you Sofie, glad you had a great experience with us. 
Merchery was extremely quick with their service. As soon as I submitted a request for a quote, within minutes, I received an email from a member of the Merchery team. She worked with me on my designs and ensured that all of the pieces arrived in time for our company event. The items are high quality and sustainably sourced, which was very important to our team. Highly recommend Merchery for your company swag needs!
Multiple orders - always üíØ !
We made already multiple orders for all the teammates of company! Patagonia jackets, water bottles and mugs, all personalized with our logo!
Perfect customer service, perfect delivery and the teams are delighted! Even when some paterial was not 100% perfect we were replaced by better material. Knowing all this is made from reused/recycled material... Love it ! 
Thank you Merchery! New order coming soon!
We placed several orders with Merchery and always have been pleasantly surprised both by the reactivity of their team and the quality of their products and customization. It makes ordering branded merch for our company extremely simple and saves us a lot of precious time. Congrats team Merchery!
Due to an internal logistics issue
Due to an internal logistics issue, they didn't deliver my order on time. They issued a credit note but by the time they informed me it was too late to get the items made elsewhere.
Hi John, thank you for your feedback! We apologize for the delay in delivering your order and any inconvenience it may have caused. We're taking steps to improve our processes to avoid similar situations in the future. We hope to serve you better in the future. ‚òÄÔ∏è

Haven‚Äôt we all walked out of an event with our hands full of useless, ugly promotional items?
As the world of corporate gifts is made of smoke and mirrors, we wanted to offer a solution that is both premium & sustainable. We were tired of all those cheap corporate gifting such as the ridiculous plastic USB key, the poor quality t-shirt or the basic plastic pens.
So we decided to act! As a unique gifts supplier, we hope to break the cycle. Our company is here to offer you a selection of custom corporate gifts that are both qualitative and long-lasting.
So, whether you‚Äôre looking to reward your employees, thank your clients or impress your partners, our premium corporate gifting solutions are sure to leave a lasting impression. With our focus on quality, sustainability and personalization, you can trust us to be your go-to gift supplier for all your corporate needs.
When diving into this industry, we realized how twisted it was. Most of the corporate gifting companies are proposing bad quality products, made in unknown conditions and imported in mass from Asia.
In this race for lower costs, corporate gifting companies tend to neglect sourcing and end up offering cheap personalized gifts that people will eventually throw away after a week.
There is nothing sustainable about that and yet, businesses spend billions each year in corporate gifting. Believe it or not, the branded swag industry is estimated at more than $100b.
We believe that quality can win over quantity. And we thought that a better sourcing and transparency on where and how our promotional products are made would bring back value to this short term game.
That's why we source only thoughtful gifts options. From high-quality leather goods to eco-friendly products, our team of experts carefully selects each item to ensure that they meet our standards of quality and sustainability. We're proud to propose you a catalogue full of top brands and products, with real values & commitment towards both people and planet.
