Putting a global spotlight on overfishing 
At a surface level, most people understand that there’s a growing problem with overfishing and dwindling levels of fish stocks. But how bad is it really, who’s responsible, and what action be taken?
Dedicated to tackling some of the planet’s most ambitious challenges, Minderoo Foundation set out to bring accountability to countries’ fishing practices by looking deeper at the problem, with the launch of a world-first Global Fishing Index. Based on complex research and data spanning 142 countries and 1,465 fish stocks, the Index was created to highlight the shortfalls of nations, policy-makers and companies fishing practices.
The sheer complexity and scale of this undertaking required a method of organising and representing its data and findings. An interface that could make this vast amount of data accessible, informative and engaging. One that would communicate clear and impactful results of each country, while allowing for easy cross-country comparison.
Embedding deeply with the Minderoo Foundation research team, we co-created a high-performing, intuitive, yet robust tool that breaks down the critical information of the Global Fishing Index to the scientific community, industry and policy-makers alike.

GOLD SKULL PADC 2022 – Best Digital for Good
GOLD SKULL PADC 2022 – Best in Show
SILVER – International Anthem Awards. Digital & Innovative Experiences
Best in Show – FTG. Campaign Brief Awards. 
Working closely to co-design with the Minderoo Foundation research team, our team were able to adapt to the rapidly changing needs of the project as research and findings came to light. Many iterations of data visualisation were explored to give the clearest representation of the data.
      Our Global Fishing Index is a wake-up call to governments and businesses around the world. It's time to take accountability for the health of your fisheries, the size of your fishing fleets and the level of access provided to foreign fleets to fish your waters.    
The results from the report are alarming to say the least – of the assessed stocks, 50% are overfished. Further, nearly 1 in 10 stocks have been driven to collapse. Most concerning though, is the lack of available data to measure and compare. The data simply isn’t there.
The Global Fishing Index gained international media attention. With the framework set, Minderoo Foundation now have a powerful platform to build upon for future Global Fishing Indexes. Furthermore, we’ve helped to highlight some of the critical gaps in global fisheries policies and data. David Attenborough writes 
“A most valuable ammunition in the fight for our ocean”
      We couldn’t have achieved this vision without the Anthologie team who helped bring the tool to life. Leaders and change-makers can now explore fisheries performance and challenges at a country level, providing a much needed platform to compare progress and share solutions.

meta title:Carbon Calculator — Anthologie

Empowering all Australians to make positive changes
Surprisingly, Australians have one of the highest personal carbon footprints in the world. In response to this, we were tasked by Carbon Positive Australia to design a carbon calculator that would help Aussies understand, measure and offset their carbon footprint.
Driven by this important purpose, we collectively set out to create the single most user-friendly carbon calculator, to inspire Australians to make positive changes to their own impact. Uniquely based on Australian emissions factors, the calculator strikes a balance between detail and simplicity, distilling complex information down into practical actions.
The tool is designed to be completed in one sitting – questions are prepared in such a way as to be answerable on the spot, while at the same time having a depth of analysis to generate detailed and actionable results. The calculator aims to deliver an engaging, repeat-use experience, encouraging the user to track their impact and reduce and offset their emissions.
Through in-depth user testing, the experience was crafted to take advantage of simple design patterns and repetition, allowing the user to quickly learn how to navigate and use the tool.
      We knew that Anthologie was a B-Corp but what came next was a welcome surprise. We had found a team of smart, talented individuals with a genuine investment in the delivery of our project. What has made the relationship different is that they share our ethos, and this shared approach has made the experience one that we intend to take into the future.    
      Australia’s user-friendly Carbon Footprint Calculator represents the first outcome of Anthologie’s annual pro-bono program, Fulcrum. Supporting social enterprises and not-for-profits to bring innovative ideas to life.    
The tool was built as a standalone React application, integrating with Carbon Positive Australia’s own website and online retail system. Visitors can calculate their carbon footprint and then proceed to offset their carbon emissions by investing in native revegetation projects.

meta title:Curtin Exchange — Anthologie

Bringing Curtin’s $500m ‘campus of the future’ to life
The rapidly changing needs of higher education demand a new approach to connecting, learning and sharing. Curtin University’s Exchange Precinct, is an inspired response to this with Stage One of the ‘Greater Curtin’ Master Plan.
An innovation precinct designed to bring the University, industry and community together — forming ‘a campus of the future’ where students can connect with industry leaders while benefitting from new technologies and ways of living and working.
As brand and communications partner, Anthologie united a diverse group of academic, community and government stakeholders across the naming, positioning and envisioning of this one-of-a-kind innovation precinct. At its heart, Exchange is all about sharing — shared experiences, shared spaces, and shared energy. ‘Life, shared’, is embodied by a fluid and dynamic identity that shows how the lines between, work, study, and play will increasingly blur in this vibrant new place.
Following an extensive Place Making Strategy by the Hornery Institute, we developed the name, positioning and creative platform to launch Exchange.
Inspired by desire lines (new paths created by foot traffic) and themes of connection, the brand identity represents the way people move in and around places, and the endless flow of energy, ideas and interactions.
We created an immersive website experience that showcased Exchange’s many projects, with interactive maps and galleries.
      Exchange marks an exciting new chapter in Curtin’s evolution, and the brand perfectly captures the essence of what this new precinct will be about – a free flowing exchange of ideas and people.
