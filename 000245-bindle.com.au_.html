At Bindle we understand how important it is to incorporate the business logo on a corporate gift, so with signature style, we have introduced Bindle NUDE.
Corporate Gifts that leave a lasting impression
Bindle NUDE is a boutique corporate gift service in which we work with your business to create a unique gift for your clients, complete with stylish gift packaging design that incorporates your branding and logos. We source products according to your specifications and create a custom ‘business gift box’ that looks and feels much, much more than just a ‘business gift box’.
We opt for recycled packaging and printed collateral and avoid nasty plastics. We believe that sustainable packaging doesn't have to be unattainable. You can be environmentally conscious and responsible while creating a premium product for your customers to enjoy.
Our team will help you select from a range of locally sourced products, whether you are looking to build a gourmet corporate gift box with delectable chocolate and luxury items, or perhaps a property and settlement gift hamper with luxurious candles, kitchen staples and hand soaps that instantly make a house a home.
Whether you are searching for a unique gift for clients or something special for your guests, a customised Bindle will never disappoint. In a cut-throat business world, this may just be the advantage that wins you the business and spreads positive word of mouth marketing.
Times are fast a changing and businesses are rapidly adjusting. Traditionally, corporate gift hampers have been given externally to clients, customers or guests. Now’s the time to also turn your ‘ROI’ focus to the internal and create a business gift hamper for your staff. Many businesses have transitioned to home offices and employees are adjusting too – some working at a makeshift desk in the garage, others simultaneously trying to wrangle the kids and conference calls! Create your own corporate branded gift basket just for your employees to show that just because they are out of sight, they are not out of mind. 
We have a number of items we can include in your ‘work from home’ custom corporate gift box, from desk pads, organisers and candles to create a luxe office feel, or snacks, for the ‘virtual’ office event. 
If work milestones and celebrations are currently falling by the wayside, a personalised gift box for business will tide you over until a pat on the back, handshake or round of applause at a staff meeting are once again possible. In the current climate the small gesture of a luxury corporate hamper can go a long way in keeping your employees engaged and motivated.
We have created a personal and professional service that's completely seamless from start to finish. We manage stock, timelines and instalments of gifts and are understanding and adaptable.
We pride ourselves on getting to know your business and brand to ensure we deliver a beautiful and sophisticated product based on your objectives, themes and budget.
We are a values-driven organisation with incredibly high standards. We exist to celebrate and support the extraordinary talent of local artisans. Every part of a Bindle gift is Australian – from the products to the packaging to the hand that wraps them. 
As one of only a handful of Australian gifting businesses that are B Corp Certified we ensure the suppliers we work with also have a key focus on sustainability so as a collective we are working together to reduce our carbon footprint.
We ordered a custom, IntelligenceBank branded Bindle gift box for all of our staff and it was a huge hit. The branding, quality and full service as amazing. We will definitely be ordering again!
Erica and the team at Bindle have been a dream to work with.
From day one they made the effort to understand our brand and what we were hoping to achieve through our corporate gifting.
We chose Bindle firstly for it’s Australian buy-local focus, and secondly because of their high quality product offering.
We feel proud sending out our gifts as they encapsulate our brand and what we value.
Working with Bindle to create some corporate gift packs has been a wonderful experience.
Launching a new business can be very time consuming so finding great business partners that can help support your desired outcome is vital. Bindle have exceeded my expectations and made the whole process streamlined.
The gift packs I now have for my clients are absolutely beautiful and a fabulous reflection of my brand.
