“ Providing a sustainable alternative to the traditional fundraising model of bake sales and chocolate drives
Onya Fundraising is a great opportunity for your contributors to support your cause by purchasing products that are environmentally friendly, high quality, useful and actively contribute to reducing single use plastic. 
There are few options available to most of us when given the task of coming up with great fundraising ideas.
There are many things to consider.  Some of the most common questions that come to mind are:
What haven’t people seen before in fundraising? (Why should they buy from us?)
Who will we sell to? (How big is our potential market?)
Does this mean I have to bake?
If I don’t bake, who will?
Where and when are we going to hold the stall?
Who will set up and man the stall?
Sustainable Fundraising Ideas with Eco-Friendly Products
Onya provides a great alternative to the traditional fundraising model of bake sales and chocolate drives and is a great opportunity for your contributors to purchase something that is environmentally friendly, high quality and useful.
Below are just some of the great reasons you should consider Onya for your next fundraising venture:
Selling Onya for fundraising provides a memorable and eco-friendly alternative to the sale of “traditional” fundraising items such as cakes and chocolate
Be proud of selling products that are not only high quality, useful and functional, but are designed to be durable and last for years to come…and not contribute to your waistline!
Onya products are 100% recyclable, and wherever possible, made from recycled materials
Get rewarded for your efforts – with healthy profit margins of 40%+, you are guaranteed to get to your fundraising target faster.
Quick, easy and cost effective to set up and begin reaching your fundraising goals
 While we have happily serviced many local governments and councils since 2004, we unfortunately cannot be affiliated with any particular political party.
As our brand and products are very well known here in Australia and internationally, it is important to us that we stay politically neutral and keep focussed on the issues that concern us and our followers, the issue of plastic pollution.
We hope you will understand that we believe the health of the environment is bigger than any political party, and our followers will expect us to be free from political agenda in our pursuit of positive change on plastic pollution.
Unlike local governments/councils, branding our products for any specific political party or member may be construed as support for that party or individual and as mentioned above we must remain politically neutral.
Our easiest fundraiser approach! Apply for a unique code, market to your supporters and receive a percentage of sales made using your unique code.  We pick, pack & ship the goods for you. 
Place your order, set your products up for display and sell at a fete or market stall taking payments on the day 
Send out order sheets to your supporters, collate them, collect payments, submit your order, and then distribute the orders to each supporter

Custom Branded Reusable Bags | Onya		
Free shipping for all AUS orders over $75 AUD | Flat rate shipping of $12 USD for USA & Canada​​
Onya is excited to be able to offer the opportunity to custom brand across a large selection of our reusable bag range.
Although we require minimum order quantities in order to make the order cost effective, our prior customers realize that even if they have some bags left over from an event, the excess can be used in other marketing ways throughout the year to add value and not just as a one off.
Who are custom orders best suited to?
We believe custom orders are best suited to businesses, government groups and other independent organizations that are looking for an effective way to get their brand/cause into the hands of potential customers in a way that is unique and memorable.
 company with a social & environmental conscience, using Onya as your branding partner allows you to spruik your environmental credentials to your clients, partners, customers or constituents.  Our products are made from recycled materials where possible, such as rPET (recycled plastic drink bottles), and all our products are 100% recyclable and our aim is to operate our business based on the principals of a 
, where at no point do our products enter the waste stream.
Our Onya Reusable bag ranges are extremely durable and we pride ourselves on providing you with quality products that will last for many years to come.
We have a number of different branding options to choose from including:
 Because our bags are bespoke and made to order, the lead time for a custom bag order can be anywhere up to 12 weeks. No production will take place on custom orders placed between December 10th to February 28/29th due to manufacturer shut downs. Orders can be placed in this time but production on your order will not start until March 1st.
 The minimum order quantity required to proceed with a custom order is 500 units per bag type and per colour.
 We advise you choose a maximum of 3 colours for your design or logo if choosing embroidery as additional charges apply to each colour thereafter.  Simple logos work best as sometimes small writing can be hard to make out at a glance or render in embroidery.  If your logo is made up of more than 3 colours, we also have the option to digital print for the pocket/front designs on shopping bags, side bags & backpacks where you can use an almost unrestricted colour palette.
To find out more about creating your own custom bags, please fill in and submit the form below and one of our friendly Onya team members will contact you soon.
