We help organisations embrace the unstoppable transition to a cleaner, decentralised energy system and seize the opportunities that this shift presents.
Energy is undoubtedly one of the critical sustainability challenges facing us. But it’s also an area of massive opportunity for improving productivity and efficiency, driving innovation and leveraging government incentives. Organisations that embrace these opportunities in a proactive way stand to benefit the most.
Our experienced team has expertise in all aspects of sustainable energy, as outlined below. Our approach combines technical engineering capability with business strategy and financial analysis expertise to provide outcomes that deliver tangible benefits to our clients.
We help clients in all aspects of energy procurement – from basic tariff optimisation through to developing and delivering corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs). Our work in this area includes developing corporate energy procurement strategies and working with our energy broker partners to go to market on behalf of clients and seek out the best energy deals.
We work with all levels of government to design, develop, implement and evaluate policies relating to energy efficiency, renewables, electric vehicles, energy storage, hydrogen and other aspects of clean energy. 
Our team has dedicated stakeholder engagement, financial analysis and economic modelling expertise to support our policy capability.
We help our clients to scope, size, finance and develop commercial and grid-scale renewable energy projects. This includes everything from pre-feasibility studies through to managing the project development process from end-to-end, bringing in our panel of credible partners as necessary.
We provide certification and auditing services for various energy efficiency schemes including the Climate Solutions Fund (CSF), the Victorian Energy Upgrades (VEU) scheme, the NSW Energy Savings Scheme (ESS) and the Renewable Energy Target (RET). We also have in-house assessors undertaking NABERS ratings and Building Energy Efficiency Certificate (BEEC) applications to enable compliance with the Commercial Buildings Disclosure (CBD) legislation.
We are specialists in energy efficiency. We help clients identify energy efficiency opportunities, conduct feasibility studies and develop business cases for energy projects, including delivering energy audits in accordance with AS/NZS 3598:2014 standard. 
We also provide project management and implementation services for energy efficiency projects. And, our team of Certified Measurement and Verification Professionals (CMVPs) develop and implement M&V plans, allowing clients to understand and quantify the savings achieved by these projects.
We offer energy metering, monitoring, analytics and data management solutions to help clients understand and interrogate their energy profile and simulate different energy management options. With the growing availability of ‘big data’ at the facility level, our team of data experts delivers critical insights into operations and energy uses, and develops machine learning models and energy performance indicators (EnPIs) to help drive improvements in energy use.
 by shifting from them from ad hoc energy management practices across siloed business functions to a more systematic and integrated approach to energy performance based on continuous improvement. 
We conduct diagnostic sessions to identify gaps in EnMS, and develop roadmaps for improvement. 
We also have expertise developing and implementing ISO50001-compliant EnMSs, and can deliver EnMS training and internal audits in preparation for certification.
Batteries operating in unison with demand response technologies can help businesses earn additional revenue through electricity market arbitrage, providing grid services (FCAS and RERT) and avoiding the need for local electricity network augmentation. 
We help clients understand the opportunities and costs in relation to these technologies. We also scope out and analyse strategies for the deployment of embedded networks and virtual power plants.

meta description:Climate change is the most compelling environmental challenge of our time.

We help our clients to understand their exposure to climate change, increase their resilience to its negative impacts, and transition to a low-carbon future.
Climate change is the most compelling environmental challenge of our time. Businesses and governments are under increasing pressure to demonstrate action and leadership. In this environment it is crucial for organisations of all shapes and sizes to understand the regulatory, economic, scientific and technological context of this global challenge.
At Point Advisory, we help organisations of all shapes and sizes to understand and navigate the risks and opportunities that the inevitable path to decarbonisation brings.
Historically, organisations set emissions reduction targets based on what they thought they could achieve. But with the signing of the Paris Agreement, the rules have changed – and organisations now set targets based on what constitutes their fair share of emissions reductions to limit the worst impacts of climate change, otherwise known as ‘science-based targets’ (SBTs). We also provide

 has elevated climate change from the domain of sustainability professionals into the boardroom. Companies around Australia are grappling with how to address the issue, and implement the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
We use emerging best practices to help our clients derive strategic benefits from the application of the TCFD recommendations by identifying what opportunities might exist in the future carbon-constrained world, and how risks can be mitigated. We leverage our extensive experience in this field to provide the whole range of services, from technical assessments to strategic scenario analysis, to support our clients in this transition and adaptation to a different world.
A net zero strategy maps out the pathway for an organisation to shift from where they are now, to where they need to be. Our unique mix of technical, economic and strategic capabilities means we’re perfectly placed to do this work. These capabilities include carbon accounting, energy efficiency, renewables, land management, economic modeling, carbon offsetting and business strategy.
We’ve been involved in some of the highest-profile net zero work in Australia, having assisted the NSW, ACT, Victorian and Tasmanian governments on various aspects of their net zero targets and strategies.
Through our net zero experience, we’ve developed a suite of interactive tools to help our clients along the net zero journey.

We can also arrange for the purchase and surrender of eligible carbon credits. Visit our brokerage and procurement service at 
We help our clients to meet their reporting obligations under the federal government’s National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme. This includes assistance in developing compliance systems, establishing data collection, applying emissions calculation methodologies and creating tools to make the reporting process more efficient. We have experience working on NGER-related projects with clients from practically every sector of the Australian economy, from mining and manufacturing through to waste and banking.

From bushfires and droughts to floods and cyclones, climate change is already physically impacting our world. We help clients to identify and manage their exposure to changing climates. We use best practice frameworks and processes to undertake 
 and vulnerability assessments, quantify physical risks where appropriate, and integrate uncertainty for better decision making.
We also work with our clients to build their capacity to respond to climate change by embedding climate change understanding throughout their organisation. We collaboratively build evolutive climate change adaptation plans with clear but flexible pathways.
The transition to a net zero emissions future will require businesses and governments to roll out emissions reductions projects. Schemes like Australia’s 
 (formerly the Emissions Reduction Fund) provide opportunities for organisations to create carbon credits from their emissions reduction projects, thereby creating an additional revenue stream and helping to improve the project’s business case.
We help our clients to identify emissions reduction projects across a range of methodologies (e.g. energy efficiency, fuel switching, landfill gas, avoided deforestation and transportation). We also help them to calculate the potential emissions reductions, and develop business cases for their projects.
