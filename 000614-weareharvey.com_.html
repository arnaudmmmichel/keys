We want to improve our impact; optimise time spent on clients; deliver greater value and growth for clients; prepare for B Corp recertification
There were no major changes to our governance in 21/22 and weâll continue to maintain our current governance and ownership set up
Our mission is to unlock the potential of the new economy to leave behind a better world. This past 12 months, we took the time to breakdown what this means to us in detail.
Since day one, itâs been important that we use Harvey as a tool for funnelling essential funds towards initiatives that help find solutions. 
Harvey has gone from leaps to bounds since our backflip last year on not building a bigger team. In addition to the strong and lean crew of Becky, Simon, Sarah and Rachel, weâve had Ezra, Gillian and a growing list of experts who provide support.
We were recognised in B Corpâs âBest for the Worldâ lists for our impact in Community, which means scoring in the top 5% of the global community.
What did this look like IRL in 2021-22? To be honest, the last 12 months were a heady mix of highlights and progress, alongside moments where we didnât quite meet our expectations. 
A few months ago we went to Cambodia & Bangladesh to meet our colleagues, connect with end customers like Mrs Jonaki Akhtar in Bosila to get a first hand understanding of how 1 billion people live, without clean cooking. It was tough to hear their challenges, but positive to see how our work impacts people in a really positive way.
âGoodâ is baked into our constitution (yum!) from our governance, to the team we never meant to build we show up every day for equality and wellness. 
Weâre acutely aware of the fact that Harvey doesnât exist in a vacuum. And even though we may be small, our operations and decisions can have a direct impact on our immediate (and extended) communities. So we strive, at all times, to enrich the community in which we operate.Â 
It goes without saying that the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing our species right now. Since day one, itâs been important to us to use Harvey as a tool for funnelling essential funds towards initiatives that are helping find solutions. Our contribution might be small in the grand scheme of things, but it means a lot to us to know that weâre trying our best.
Now that weâre a B Corp, we want to utilise the B Corp framework to help Harvey grow and thrive in a way that helps our planet and the people who inhabit it. As such, weâve mapped our 2021 goals against the five pillars of B Corp assessment.
Our mission is to unlock the potential of the new economy to leave behind a better world. At all times, we primarily work with companies who are helping move the needle on some of the pressing issues of our time through their work â either directly or indirectly. Importantly, we donât work with organisations who are being destructive.Â 
Over the course of 2020, we helped more conscious businesses grow. And thatâs really what this is all about for us. To be able to play even a small role in helping ethically minded businesses connect their messages, products and services to more Australians gets us out of bed in the morning (if Margie hasnât already, that is!).
We know our impact is small in the grand scheme of things, but itâs important to us that we do our bit to help create a fairer, more sustainable and more equitable society in whatever way we can.

Strategic plan and new brand to serve an intersectional community
Wire is the only Victoria-wide free information, support and referral service for women, non-binary and gender-diverse people.
WIRE began as a support service for women, but over the years expanded their audience to include all women and gender diverse people. They wanted to update their messaging and visual brand to clearly reflect their inclusivity, and to better represent what they stand for today.
We combined insights from customer research (surveys and one on one) interviews to deliver a brand strategy that unified staff and partners around the big picture. Next we updated the brand messaging and identity to be more inclusive and empowering for all.
Building on WIREâs strong brand foundation, we helped to clarify their offering, welcome a more diverse audience, and streamline communication across all channels.

ATEC exists to solve clean cooking & climate change
ATECâs mission is to solve climate change by decarbonising cooking for billions of people around the world. They wanted to improve their brand, create a strong marketing strategy, and build a new website that made their mission clear enough to attract support and influence behaviour change with their customers (bottom of pyramid households) in Bangladesh and Cambodia.
We built a clarifying website and crafted a marketing strategy that propelled ATECâs mission forward. Leveraging data-driven insights, we made targeted content and optimised ad placements to drive leads and gather momentum.

Cyclion | Harnessing Tech for a Greener Future
Harnessing Tech for a Greener Future
Crafting a digital identity for a revolutionary waste-to-energy innovation
Turning waste into a resource through revolutionary technology
Cyclion Energy embarked on a mission to revolutionise waste management globally, turning household waste into a source of energy. As a budding Australian clean tech start-up, they envisioned a system that was not only economically viable but also scalable to suit different environments, from vibrant urban centres to remote regions. However, to convey this groundbreaking initiative to the world, they needed a robust online presence, a refreshed brand design, and refined messaging that resonated with their vision. That's where Harvey stepped in, ready to carve out a digital identity that echoed Cyclion's innovative spirit and green ethos.
Our journey began with the meticulous crafting of a website that would serve as the cornerstone of Cyclion's digital identity. We delved deep into the core of Cyclion's revolutionary technology to create a narrative that was both compelling and easy to understand for visitors. The website was designed to be a beacon of information, shedding light on the intricate processes and the science behind Cyclion's pioneering technology.
 and with the creative brilliance of designer 
, we rejuvenated the brand design, infusing it with elements that mirrored the company's commitment to environmental sustainability. The refreshed brand became a harmonious blend of modernity and nature, reflecting Cyclion's innovative approach to recycling and waste management.
Parallelly, we honed the messaging, ensuring it was sharp, focused, and conveyed the revolutionary impact Cyclion aimed to create in the waste management sector. Every word was chosen to echo the company's dedication to fostering a greener future through science-led, scalable solutions.
The culmination of our efforts was a vibrant, user-friendly website that not only delineated Cyclion's groundbreaking technology but also became a hub for potential investors and individuals passionate about environmental sustainability. The refreshed brand design and refined messaging have positioned Cyclion as a leader in the clean tech space, ready to spearhead a recycling revolution with a local solution to a global challenge.
The website now stands as a testament to Cyclion's commitment to harnessing technology to turn waste bound for landfills or seas into electricity and fuel, offering a glimpse into a future where people and the planet thrive in harmony.
Harvey has been instrumental in bringing our vision to life through a website that speaks volumes about our commitment to a greener future. Their expertise in brand design and messaging refinement has truly elevated our digital presence.
