Reef Credits – 3 different approaches to meet different needs
When Reef Credits launched in 2020, there was just one way farmers and other land managers could get involved – by improving fertiliser management to reduce the flow of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to the Great Barrier Reef. Now, three years later, there are two new ways to get involved that suit a broader spectrum of farming operations.
Reef Credits or Grants – carefully considering the best options for you
Environmental markets are not dissimilar to farming or commodity markets. The difference being, instead of food or fibre production, environmental markets measure and place a value on and trade in cleaner air, water or improved habitat and biodiversity. 
What are Reef Credits and how are they generated?
Being paid to implement best practice land management and deliver cleaner water to the Reef, without negatively impacting productivity may seem too good to be true. But according to GreenCollar Business Development Manager Bart Dryden, and the numerous farmers already running Reef Credit projects, it really is a win:win transaction that benefits both the farmer and the environment.

Caring for the land, your business, and the environment
GreenCollar works in partnership with farmers, graziers, traditional owners, and other land managers to design projects that align with your operational goals. With over 200 projects registered around Australia, we know what it takes to combine carbon and farming.
Undertaking an environmental project with us means you get paid for environmental outcomes resulting from land management practices that deliver benefits for your business as well as the environment. Our projects are designed to enhance agricultural productivity whilst storing carbon in vegetation and soil, supporting infrastructure upgrades, feral pest management and land regeneration among other things. And the money that the project brings through the front gate is yours to invest back into your business.
Work with our team of project development and technical specialists can help you earn a diversified, resilient income stream through carbon farming.

GreenCollar will organise a no-cost, no-obligation assessment of your property’s eligibility and carbon potential. We pride ourselves on providing in-depth and accurate assessments that lead to real results.
Our experienced, local teams provide expert advice on carbon projects and an unmatched understanding of what will suit your land and your business.
Carbon farming projects pay land managers directly for the environmental service of carbon storage or abatement, but there are significant additional benefits that come with each project. A range of environmental, economic and social benefits for landholders, producers, communities and the environment enhance long-term productivity and sustainability of the land.
Additional income from carbon credits allows for further investment in both land and business:
Ability to afford supplementary feed or de-stock early in adverse conditions
Resilient income not reliant on commodity prices or affected by drought/weather
Implementation of closer monitoring and recording to make timely decisions
Improving soil health and water retention
Higher productivity and improved animal health
Restoring habitat for native flora and fauna
Reducing impacts of agriculture activities and adverse flow on effects
Providing income, jobs and security to regional and rural communities
Helping to keep families on the land
Carbon projects have allowed us to achieve the triple bottom line on our property. We’ve been able to marry up the economic, environmental and social aspects of our business. We believe we have a duty to care for country and to produce sustainably for our future generations.
We run sheep for production and have actually been able to improve overall ground cover and the diversity of native ground cover by running fewer stock but to a point where we’re fetching a higher price at the farm gate.
Vegetation projects generate carbon abatement by storing carbon in growing vegetation or by preventing the release of emissions from clearing native vegetation. There are a number of eligible activities that may be implemented for vegetation management.
 projects aim to regenerate parts of a property where vegetation has previously been suppressed. Carbon abatement is calculated through modelling software. To be eligible a project area must involve one or more of the following regeneration activities: management of the timing and extent of grazing, management of feral animals, cessation of mechanical or chemical destruction of regrowth or the exclusion of livestock.
 projects require protection of native forest which has previously received government consent to be cleared and converted to cropland or grassland. These projects generate credits for landholders who maintain forest and do not clear the land. Carbon abatement is achieved by not clearing native vegetation, avoiding the release of emissions.
projects protect growing forest from future scheduled clearing. Carbon is stored in native regrowth scheduled to be cleared under a property’s historical clearing regime. There must be evidence of two historical clearing events that have occurred where unrestricted clearing is permitted and cropping or grazing is undertaken.
Beef Herd Management projects reduce the overall emissions intensity of pasture-fed beef cattle herds. Changes are made to herd structure, and new management actions are implemented to improve herd productivity. Land managers earn carbon credits through the emissions reduced per kilogram of beef produced.
Activities that improve herd performance and reduce emissions intensity include reducing the average age of the herd, reducing the proportion of unproductive cattle within the herd, or changing the number of cattle in each livestock class within the herd.
Soil carbon projects require the introduction of new management actions that increase carbon inputs into soil or reduce the loss of soil organic carbon. A range of agricultural activities can be used to build and sequester soil carbon stocks.
These activities may include converting cropland to pasture, renovating pastures, changing grazing patterns or introducing sustainable, productive land management practices. Projects are implemented through a series of modelled scenarios or through direct measurements to estimate carbon sequestration over time and produce carbon credits.
GreenCollar partners with leading soil carbon developer AgriProve, to make these projects accessible  across Australia’s diverse landscapes and agricultural enterprises.

Reef Credits: A win for farmers and for the Great Barrier Reef
Working in partnership to reward improved land management and unlock new capital
Reef Credits is a voluntary environmental market that addresses the issue of poor water quality at the Great Barrier Reef by paying land managers for improved water quality resulting from their on-farm actions, without compromising the productivity of their land.
GreenCollar works in partnership with farmers, graziers and other land managers to develop projects that align with farming business goals. Projects focus on reducing the flow of nutrients (namely Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen) to the Great Barrier Reef through improved cropping practices, or by establishing wetlands. Repairing gullies also generates Reef Credits by preventing fine sediment erosion on agricultural land.  Each Reef Credit is a tradeable unit representing a quantifiable amount of nutrient or sediment prevented from entering the Great Barrier Reef
Reef Credits are sold to businesses, investors, philanthropists and governments seeking to reach water quality targets or achieve corporate sustainability outcomes. The revenue generated from Reef Credits provides land managers with an additional and diversified income stream, that supports ongoing improved practices.
 is the independent administrator of the Reef Credit Scheme. It ensures the integrity of the scheme and every Reef Credit generated by applying clear and robust rules that independently audit and verify water quality improvements that are real, additional and permanent.
 a win for the farm and a win for the reef
Why one QLD cane grower recommends Reef Credits
How reef credits can boost farm productivity
Improved soil health and increased productivity
Receive a regular and diversified income stream from Reef Credits for 10-25 years.
Get support to complete capital intensive works such as wetland construction and gully repairs.
Enable adoption of land management best practice and innovation.
Each Reef Credit represents 1kg Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen or 538kgs of sediment prevented from entering the Great Barrier Reef.
“It’s good for the community, it’s good for your soil health, and also it’s good for the reef, so it’s a win for everyone. In my mind this is a farming system, moving forward, that is going to increase my productivity”
Reef Credits are issued to projects that meet the strict requirements of Reef Credit Methodologies.  Methodologies describe how the improvement in water quality, or Reef Credits is quantified.
Three Reef Credit Methodologies have been approved so far, with more being developed under the Reef Credit Standard.
This method earns Reef Credits through quantified reductions in the amount of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) flowing to waterways and the Reef through improved nutrient management practices.
Reducing DIN helps prevent algal bloom, which in turn prevents outbreaks of Crown of Thorn Starfish, a breed of invasive Starfish that eats new coral faster than it can grow.
Wetland projects earn Reef Credits based on measured reductions in Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) flowing to the Great Barrier Reef.
Wetland treatment systems are engineered systems that replicate and enhance the physical, biological and chemical treatment processes that occur in natural wetlands, holding water containing nutrients on site for longer to reduce runoff and erosion, and increase natural filtration.
They can remove up to 300kg of DIN per hectare, creating an opportunity to turn less productive parts of the landscape into a diversified income stream that can be reinvested into your business.
This method earns Reef Credits based on quantified reductions in the amount of fine sediment flowing to the Great Barrier Reef from gully erosion. Remediation of gullies can include reshaping, revegetating, engineering control structures, and managing grazing.
Fine sediment flowing to the reef from the land has an impact on the health of the reef as it interferes with filter feeding organisms, reduces coral recruitment, alters the quantity and quality of light available, and smothers corals. It can also affect reproductive cycles and early development of coral and some species of fish.

Who administers the Reef Credits scheme?
The Reef Credits Scheme is administered by Eco-Markets Australia, an independent not-for-profit organisation.  This is similar to other successful voluntary environment markets  around the world and ensures the integrity of the market.
How much are Reef Credits worth?
The value of Reef Credits, like other environmental commodities such as carbon credits, depends on the supply and demand dynamics of the open market.
How are Reef Credit Methodologies written?
Reef Credit Methodologies can be written by anyone wishing to see particular types of projects developed.  Methods must comply with the requirements of the Reef Credit Scheme. The initial methods have been developed through collaboration between GreenCollar, NRM organisations, researchers, government and an expert advisory panel of scientific and other stakeholders.
Do the methods use modelling or water quality monitoring to quantify Reef Credits?
Some methods use modelling and others use water quality monitoring depending on the type of activity and availability of peer reviewed models.
Is the Reef Credit market be voluntary or regulated?
The Reef Credit Scheme is voluntary.
How can various sectors support Reef Credit supply and demand?
Agricultural sectors can support the increase in Reef Credit supply by encouraging participation in the Scheme. Land managers can earn additional, diversified income streams by undertaking activities that result in water quality improvements.
Corporates, government, philanthropists and other interested parties can support demand by purchasing Reef Credits to meet their environmental targets.
Is Reef Credits a grant scheme?
No. Reef Credits are a market-based, non-government approach to improving water quality at the Great Barrier Reef. Credits are only generated when a specific, measured outcome is achieved. Income is derived from the sale of these credits to buyers and can be reinvested into farming operations.
Contact GreenCollar by phone or email to have an initial discussion or arrange a free Reef Credit assessment.  We’re happy to arrange a site visit to determine whether a project is possible and which type of project best will generate Reef Credits.

Reef Credits – 3 different approaches to meet different needs
When Reef Credits launched in 2020, there was just one way farmers and other land managers could get involved – by improving fertiliser management to reduce the flow of dissolved inorganic nitrogen to the Great Barrier Reef. Now, three years later, there are two new ways to get involved that suit a broader spectrum of farming operations.
Reef Credits or Grants – carefully considering the best options for you
Environmental markets are not dissimilar to farming or commodity markets. The difference being, instead of food or fibre production, environmental markets measure and place a value on and trade in cleaner air, water or improved habitat and biodiversity. 
What are Reef Credits and how are they generated?
Being paid to implement best practice land management and deliver cleaner water to the Reef, without negatively impacting productivity may seem too good to be true. But according to GreenCollar Business Development Manager Bart Dryden, and the numerous farmers already running Reef Credit projects, it really is a win:win transaction that benefits both the farmer and the environment.
Beyond carbon credits: Investing in multiple environmental markets to meet sustainability goals
Environmental markets have grown to meet real-world demand for tangible, positive environmental outcomes and corporations are adjusting their sustainability goals to keep up.
The flow-on benefits of Reef Credits
The benefits of Reef Credits are vast, both for land managers and the protection of the Great Barrier Reef.
Five sugarcane farming businesses have successfully sold 18,000 Reef Credits to the Queensland Government as a result of changes to land management practices which prevented 18 tonnes of Nitrogen pollution from flowing to the Great Barrier Reef.
Restore the Future – Invest in a Healthy Reef
]GreenCollar CEO, James Schultz, joined Greening Australia in its second 'Restoring the Future' webinar to discuss how the creation of new markets like Reef Credits addresses crucial environmental issues by paying land managers for on-farm actions.

Verified Plastic Credits: A new path to address global plastic pollution
A world-leading plastic credit scheme that removes and recycles plastic from the environment
GreenCollar is proud to be one of the first project developers globally to offer verified credits under Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard – our first step towards addressing the global problem of single use plastics.
Plastic pollution is a major threat to our environment. Australia alone generates over 67 million tonnes of plastic waste per year with over 30 million tonnes of this waste working its way directly into the natural environment. Meanwhile, on a global scale, we are producing twice as much plastic waste as two decades ago. Over 353 million tonnes of plastic waste is produced annually, just 9% of which is recycled.
The world urgently needs to scale plastic collection and recycling infrastructure – something that can be achieved through participation in a verified market that enables the removal of plastic waste from the environment and lays the foundations of a robust circular economy. By incentivising waste collection and recycling, plastic credits can become an important and effective sustainability investment.
Far North Queensland Farm Plastic Project (
Supporting Australian banana farmers to sustainability manage their farm waste.
95% of Australia’s commercial banana production occurs in Far North Queensland (FNQ), where the industry creates over 1,500 tonnes of single use plastic bag waste each year. Waste comprises protective bags made of polyethylene (PE) which are used to protect ripening banana bunches as they grow and deliver enhanced fruit yield per bunch. However, the burden of disposal of these bags falls to farmers, who have very limited options available to them for safe disposal, re-use or recycling.
GreenCollar is working to deliver a world-leading solution by incentivising collection and recycling of waste plastic from 
 and encouraging farmers to adopt new waste management practices.
Reduction in plastic waste is measured, reported and third-party verified to generate plastic credits under the Verra Plastic Standard. Each credit represents one tonne of plastic removed from the environment and can be sold to voluntary market to investors. Revenue generated from the sale of plastic credits can drive investment in recycling technology, empower local communities and provide a financially viable method of plastic waste removal for plastic producers all over the world.

The Ghana Plastic Waste Recovery and Recycling Project. (Verra 4431)
Supporting local waste pickers to collect and recycle
GreenCollar has partnered with experienced non-profit 
 to develop and scale plastic waste collection and recycling facilities, starting in Tema and Dodowa, with plans to expand across Ghana. The project works across four plastic streams  to generate both Waste Collection Credits and Waste Recycling Credits under 
A Plastic Credit represents one metric tonne of plastic waste that has been Plastic Credits are issued based on the volume of plastic collected and recycled above pre-project baseline rates. 
 ensure all Plastic Credits represent collected and/or recycled plastic waste that is real, additional (meaning it would not have been collected or recycled without the project), and measurable Project outcomes are independently audited, as well as uniquely numbered and transparently listed. See more information 
The project supports local waste pickers and aggregators to collect bottles, bottle lids and other plastics like water sachets from the environment, and sort, clean and process them. Material that can be recycled is flaked, with some manufactured into recycled products on site, and the remaining on-sold to local manufacturers.
The program supports the livelihoods of waste pickers by creating inclusive and safe collection systems that empower informal workers and have a tangible impact on local business, communities, and the environment.
It also supports women and other marginalised individuals, who work with Environment360 to repurpose plastic waste into jewellery, coasters, combs and other products, for sale.
South Pacific Region: Developing a Project Pipeline
GreenCollar is also working within the South Pacific region to develop a pipeline of projects to remove plastic waste from the environment and drive investment in recycling capacity and infrastructure in a region globally recognised as a hotspot for oceanic plastic waste.
What is the impact of one plastic credit
Every plastic credit demonstrates one tonne of plastic either removed from the environment or recycled and remanufactured into a new product.
 sets out requirements for new, or scaled-up, collection and recycling projects that can quantify their impact in a credible, transparent and consistent way to generate plastic credits. All projects must meet stringent requirements, including social and environmental safeguards.
Credits are issued for the amount of plastic waste that has been collected from the environment and managed in a responsible manner. Management activities may include recycling, sending to secure landfill, or incinerating with energy recovery. Projects are subject to baseline monitoring to ensure that credits are only awarded for activities that are additional to business as usual.
 issues credits for recovery of plastics from the environment as well as recycling and reusing.
Recovering waste from the environment and directing it to an appropriate final destination.
Recovering and recycling plastic that would otherwise be dumped or left in the environment.
Reducing creation of virgin or single use plastic that would otherwise be introduced into the waste stream
Our approach to project development is built on partnerships and collaboration. We invest our own resources to work with on ground partners to design and implement plastic crediting projects and share the benefits.
Our expert team meet with interested parties to explain the scope of the method and discuss project options that suit business operations and activities. A business case is prepared for evaluation.
When the business case is approved, GreenCollar’s technical team completes a pre-feasibility assessment. This provides the initial cost-benefit case and assesses eligibility, risks and potential safeguards across applicable methods.
Once the project cost-benefit case has been finalised, GreenCollar prepares a Project Agreement (PA). This is a legal document that outlines the partnership and all aspects of the project roles and responsibilities.
When the PA is finalised, GreenCollar works closely with your organisation to submit a Project Description application to Verra, the administrative body for Plastic Projects. The Project Description will be subject to independent verification and validation.
Project Life Cycle – Management, monitoring and reporting
Following project validation, GreenCollar works in partnership for the duration of the project to manage, monitor and report on the project. The plastic credits generated by the Project are verified each reporting period, and credits are issued. GreenCollar is responsible for marketing and selling credits.

NaturePlus™: A scientifically robust biodiversity credit scheme that values real, measurable results for nature
Rewarding the positive biodiversity outcomes of good land stewardship
NaturePlus™ is a world-first biodiversity credit scheme that applies a scientifically robust environmental accounting framework to generate credits from projects in high conservation value landscapes. It enables scalable voluntary investment to be targeted at projects that deliver real, measurable and verifiable biodiversity outcomes.
NaturePlus™ projects are run in partnership with land managers who adapt land management practices to restore environmental condition for ecosystems, habitat and threatened species. These positive outcomes are monitored, measured, and third party audited then certified under the world-leading environmental accounting framework Accounting for Nature®. Each NaturePlus™ credit represents an one-hectare area of measured and verified restoration or conservation of environmental condition.
How does NaturePlus™ differ from other biodiversity markets?
Most payments for biodiversity outcomes are based on actions that land managers carry out with a view to restoring biodiversity in the future. NaturePlus™ is different because credits are only awarded to projects that have delivered third-party audited and certified restoration in environmental condition. As such, NaturePlus™ credits represent verified restoration in critical ecosystems and species – in other words, real outcomes for nature.
How we measure the biodiversity outcomes of agricultural stewardship
Within NaturePlus™ projects, environmental condition is benchmarked, measured and tracked using the widely respected Accounting for Nature Framework®, and each project is underpinned by a publicly available environmental account.
NaturePlus™ projects must meet a minimum level of condition to be eligible and demonstrate progressive measured restoration to be awarded credits. Once condition has reached a sustainable level, projects switch to conservation and must remain above that level to continue crediting. As a result, NaturePlus™ delivers restoration of degraded ecosystems and species populations as well as protection of high value environmental assets once a nature positive impact has been achieved.
NaturePlus™ Credits provide a meaningful pathway to support measurable action on biodiversity and achieve nature positive outcomes.
Each NaturePlus™ Credit represents an one-hectare area of measured, audited and certified restoration or conservation of environmental condition over one year. The outcomes include:
Reduced loss and degradation of natural habitats
Improved connectivity and resilience of ecosystems
 Improvement of native habitat and ongoing maintenance of healthy ecosystems and communities
Creating opportunities to scale investment in nature positive outcomes
Reversing loss and degradation of natural habitat and species
Regeneration and protection of priority landscapes and species
GreenCollar screens potential projects to ensure they are eligible to participate.
GreenCollar registers projects with Accounting for Nature® - the independent body that certifies environmental accounts as meeting science-based requirements. Following registration, projects are listed on the Accounting for Nature® website, which provides a public register of nature positive projects, similar to the Emissions Reduction Fund website.
GreenCollar uses a methodology accredited through Accounting for Nature to measure specific environmental assets on the property that help determine the environmental condition.
Based on the assessment of environmental assets, GreenCollar produces an environmental account. This sets and verifies a baseline that is used to map progress and report on how the agriculture enterprise is contributing to sustaining and improving biodiversity outcomes.
Projects are monitored for change in environmental condition periodically. Reported outcomes are third party audited and verified before NaturePlus™ credits are issued. Credits purchased will be retired in an audited registry to ensure traceability and transparency of credit accounting.
Our NaturePlus™ projects are designed to bring new credits to market that value and reward measured biodiversity outcomes of land stewardship. Investment in NaturePlus™ credits is available. Please contact us to find out more.

Unlock the value in your agricultural enterprise
Get paid for making land management changes that make sense for your operation and the environment.
GreenCollar is Australia’s largest and most successful carbon project developer. We’ve been working with farmers, graziers, traditional owners and other land managers across Australia to generate new, additional, and regular income through carbon storage projects for over 12 years. We are at the forefront of innovation in environmental markets, working on new methodologies within carbon, and establishing new markets that value water quality and biodiversity outcomes of good land stewardship, as well as methods that reward land managers for best practice management of single use plastics.
We work in partnership to design projects that align with operational goals, so undertaking a project with us means you get paid for environmental outcomes resulting from land management practices that deliver environmental, economic, and social benefits for your business as well as the environment.
Please get in touch to find out if you can earn income from your land, or if you simply want to learn more about carbon farming, reef  credits, plastic or biodiversity projects.
We provide expert advice on environmental projects and unmatched understanding of what will suit your land and your business.
With more trusted and collaborative relationships with land managers than any other developer, we work alongside government and Australia’s leading corporates to finance on-farm work and drive positive environmental impact at scale. Our nature-based solutions are designed to enhance existing agriculture operations, helping protect or restore vegetation, increase ground cover, regenerate the land, improve water quality, reduce and recycle plastics, and deliver biodiversity outcomes whilst creating a steady stream of income and improving long-term productivity of the land.
We aim to keep farms working at optimal capacity, sustain regional communities and keep families on the land.
GreenCollar underwrites substantial project development costs including scientific analysis and technical viability statements, compliance and regulatory processes and risk identification, mitigation and management.
We are grounded in science and research. We don’t compromise on quality and we hold ourselves accountable to deliver on our promises. We take the time to complete detailed assessments and understand existing operations. Our proprietary processes, models, data, market intelligence and systematic approach to field work means we go further to ensure accurate measurement and reporting in both the assessment phase and during project delivery.
GreenCollar is the project proponent within our partnership model, so we take on the delivery risk. GreenCollar is therefore responsible for meeting regulatory obligations and delivery obligations under long term offtake agreements with the Government. Our track record and sophisticated risk management systems proactively identify and manage compliance and project delivery risks across any geography throughout the project life cycle.
Ability to leverage GreenCollar’s extensive client relationships across government (state and federal) institutional corporates and evolving customer distribution channels to optimise environmental credit sales revenue. Our revenue sharing model means we have complete alignment in both minimising risk and maximising returns.
GreenCollar provides end-to-end project development and management including design and delivery, sales and marketing, compliance and risk, monitoring, auditing and reporting.
Delivering social, economic and environmental impact
Our aim is always to deliver the greatest impact possible. We are building a market for premium environmental credits that go beyond offsetting negatives and deliver net positive benefits for Australian agriculture, regional communities and the environment.
GreenCollar is the only project developer to work across the full range of nature-based carbon methodologies and we are at the forefront of the market working to develop new and innovative revenue opportunities for land managers. We launched Reef Credits in 2020, are running pilot projects in a new biodiversity framework, and developing plastics credits.
We’ve been able to continually manage and control grazing through infrastructure improvements off the back of our project. It’s increased ground cover and water retention of the soil across the landscape.
We are true partners incentivised to make the project work for you. Our soil is healthier and more resilient. Rangeland goats and sheep have less of an impact on grazing and there’s less hoof disturbance to the topsoil.
Our carbon project and our production of beef co-exist, and we’re actually seeing an improved environment for our beef because of the project.

According to the CSIRO, by 2050 the carbon market could provide an income of about $40 billion to the land sector. Our goal is to ensure this projected growth of carbon farming supports the growth of Australian agriculture instead of replacing it. We want to see more money come back through the front gate to invest in land management, infrastructure upgrades and business sustainability. Undertaking a carbon project with GreenCollar means you get paid for land management practices that store carbon in vegetation and soil – practices that align with your operational goals as well as the chosen project methodology.
Find out more about carbon farming here.
We work with you to identify methodologies and innovative practices that work with your operational goals. From project design to implementation, you remain in control and at the forefront of decision making.
With GreenCollar, carbon farming does not mean you have to destock or lock up the land. Our goal is to keep your operation running at optimal capacity. Unlike many other operators, GreenCollar is named as the Project Proponent on the Emissions Reduction Fund Register, so we take on the delivery risk. This means we manage external auditing to meet delivery and compliance obligations, allowing you to focus on your business and implementation of the project. GreenCollar also takes on the administration, technical data collection and monitoring of the project.
