I engaged People with Purpose to assist the...leadership team to formalise the company’s new Enterprise Strategy. Although I would normally engage [a] ‘big brand’ strategy firm...I made the decision based upon Danielle’s reputation and expertise in purpose-led strategy. What Danielle delivered far exceeded my expectations. Not only does Danielle have a keen strategic mind...she was also able to masterfully corral a range of stakeholders...to achieve alignment in the articulation and messaging of the strategy. I would recommend Danielle without hesitation to any Board or CEO looking to develop a strategy that...delivers on competitive direction...a compelling value proposition.
We engaged...People with Purpose to work with us [on] our values and tenets, strategic objectives and...core purpose. We were able to use the subsequent proposal put forward by People with Purpose to qualify for a grant through the Austrade Entrepreneurs Programme. The approach was a good balance between facilitative and directive giving all of the members of our senior management and board of directors opportunity for constructive input. Our experience with People with Purpose was both positive and productive. As a result we had excellent engagement internally and we apply our purpose as a decision making tool.
AgForce secured the services of Danielle Duell and People with Purpose after considering offers from other Strategic planning advisory firms. Danielle has provided the organisation with tools and alternative thought processes to create a purpose lead strategy. Danielle has been thought provoking in working with key objectives around how AQF can understand member value proposition, helping to create and deliver value. I highly recommend Danielle and her team to anyone looking to challenge traditional ideas around planning.... Timeliness and delivery exceed expectations, the resources and learnings and pleasant professional nature of the team will certainly provide inspiration, excitement and leadership.
Grant Maudsley, (former) General President AgForce Queensland Farmers, AgForce
Danielle and her team at People With Purpose have engaged with Real World Futures since the program was conceived at QUT in 2014. Danielle worked with me to design the format of an engagement program that would look at the impact of technology on future working, thinking and living and she has been active in bringing new ideas and speakers to the program. Her role has included acting as moderator across 20 events, ranging from breakfasts to full-day conferences, all relying on an ability to understand and then publicly address complex issues in conversation with leading academics and business figures.’
David Fagan, Director Corporate Transition, Vice Chancellor’s Office, QUT
We engaged People with Purpose to support us with our journey towards becoming a Utility of the Future. Danielle and her team facilitated a thought provoking and engaging conference with the leaders of our organisation helping them to understand the organisational purpose better and realise its role in creating long term business direction and strategies. Danielle’s ability to deal with complex strategies in a simple and focused way was an inspiration for our organisation.
Maryam Charehsaz, Leader Servicing Strategies Planning Group, Queensland Urban Utilities
Bush Heritage Australia engaged People with Purpose to develop new business strategy, to design and procure social media and conventional communication content and then launch a national campaign to support nature conservation. Danielle’s outstanding leadership skills and strong business experience showed through in her ability to understand the client brief, develop strategy, bring together creative teams to develop solutions and then drive outcomes. Her team were adept at working with management and Board to understand our needs and then deliver outcomes that continue to yield results for BHA. Highly recommended.
Gerard O’Neill, CEO, Bush Heritage Australia
Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef
The Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef social movement continues to engender enormous global support. It is a global social-purpose community galvanised by the symbiotic relationship between education, conservation and tourism, empowering current and future generations of the world with the knowledge, experience and ability to protect and enjoy the Great Barrier Reef.
People with Purpose were contracted in the very early days to assist with the development and documentation of the strategic focus. Danielle Duell provided outstanding advice and documentation to support the evolution of the Citizens of the GBR movement.
Alex de Waal, Chairman, Citizens of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation
People with Purpose truly delivers an in depth, quality product that has been fit-for-purpose. The Foundation was at a crossroad. Faced with the exciting challenge that we will be expected to grow much quicker than what a charitable not-for-profit entity will be able to manage. Danielle and her team were very easy, and a pleasure, to engage with. They already had knowledge...about...the healthcare sector, but also did ample preparation...to...propose future options/possibilities. A year [since] we engaged [them] we have actioned the first major step of our strategic plan... thanks to...a clear and compelling strategy.
Fiona Jonker, Executive Manager Research, Icon Group / CEO, Icon Cancer Foundation
Danielle brings exceptional intelligence and wholehearted focus to whatever she undertakes. She lead us through a rebranding process and construction of two complex websites....with grace, dedicated attentiveness and...undeniably bright, persuasive thinking. A second project brought...her team...to Chicago to work on a major conference presentation. Danielle and her team took all the stress off our shoulders...then worked with our US team to produce one of our most successful keynotes in our 25 year history.
During this period, Danielle served as Global Ambassador and one of my closest advisors. Her instincts proved flawless. People With Purpose rocks!
John J. Cimino, Jr., President and CEO, Creative Leaps International
I engaged with Danielle Duell on developing a Strategy to get our newly formed Cherish Women’s Cancer Foundation started. Danielle helped to analyse our situation...develop an action plan... introducing charitably-minded people like me to the...thinking...in revenue-focussed organisations…grounded in a desire to contribute to the development of humankind. I also credit Danielle for assisting the organisation making decisions that were ...“hard” initially. Danielle is a person with an unbelievably sharp intellect, a wide network of like-minded people and 100% commitment to success with a no-compromise attitude. I have no problems recommending Danielle’s service to any charitable organisation.
Prof Andreas Obermair, Co-Founder, Cherish Women’s Cancer Foundation
Over the past two days, I have had the benefit of working with Danielle Duell from People With Purpose discussing the benefits of a purpose-led ambidextrous strategy. Very thought provoking and I could not recommend Danielle and her team enough. What is your purpose and do your customers connect with it? I look forward to working more on this initiative in the future.

The session we had on Tuesday was one of the best facilitated sessions I have been involved in. Love your work!
Andrea Koch, Director National Farmers Federation and Principal at Andrea Koch Agtech
I enjoyed the session very much. My first with CUA - I was impressed. It was a good balance of practical/analytical and innovative/ hypothetical. You & your team did a great job.
Allison White, Head of Community at CUA, Credit Union Australia Limited October 2017
I wanted to share with you that I am now doing an exec degree on Leadership with Cambridge University and one of our modules focused on Leading with Purpose. In my assignment, I recalled many of the ideas you facilitated and I actually received top marks.
So I wanted to thank you and let you know that I really got many key learning points from that session and I am using them continuously!
Alexandra Moraru, Former Global Programme Manager, Everledger
I'd like to thank you for your time, guidance and advice in helping me define my purpose as a part of the MBA. It truly was an enabler for me to build confidence, find my passion and refine those skills I need in the future.
That workshop we did this time last year, and attending your purpose events were fantastic and guided my decisions this year, especially with my job and company selection.
Thank you for helping me transform my career through the MBA program. I hope the year is off to a flying start for you, and please reach out if you need anything at all.
I thoroughly enjoyed your session with the MBAs yesterday.
From my discussions with MBAs over the years, many have ‘parked’ their personal aspiration and purpose for the sake of dollars and/or perceived ‘success’. What you said to them will be giving many cause to reflect on not only the worth of this deferred happiness approach but also how long they can sustain a ‘dollars without purpose’ existence.
It was great meeting you! I so loved the tool that you provided us that I made my Husband do it as well. He is excited to find a purpose too :). I am sure is going to help us build our career in right direction.

Today's Leaders are Rethinking the Role of Business in Society
It is clear to many that maximising profits as a single or primary goal is no longer effective, sustainable or equitable.  It’s not tolerated by the broader community; it doesn’t attract, engage or retain the best talent; it doesn’t give adequate consideration to the social and environmental impacts business may have or solve the significant problems of our time, and it doesn’t effectively immunise businesses or entire industries from being wiped out by new entrants or shifting consumer demands.
People with Purpose helps organisations and their leaders become more prosperous, resilient and impactful, not by focusing on maximising profits per se, but by helping them become clear about why they exist and to reimagine how they might create value in ways that will improve the world.  We help businesses make profit purposefully.
Making Profit Purposefully Requires Both Strategy and Leadership 
An organisation can have an excellent purpose-led strategy but unless it has effective purposeful leadership to execute that strategy and engage its stakeholders in its execution, the strategy will fall short of its potential.  Likewise, an organisation may have exceptional, purposeful leaders, but if the leaders are not equipped with an effective purpose-led strategy their impact will be limited.
Purpose is the pinnacle of management and leadership best practice and should be used as the first filter for decision-making. It informs an organisation’s vision and strategy and the types of mindsets and toolsets to be cultivated within the business and its people.
Our suite of integrated and reinforcing services ensure that your purpose is activated and embedded, resulting in meaningful impact. 
Are you ready to use your business to improve the world? Create clarity amidst uncertainty; unlock your organisation’s potential using our proprietary tools to design an impactful and inspirational guiding purpose.

Effectively implementing a  purpose-led strategy requires purposeful leadership. Empower and inspire your leaders to execute your strategy and engage your team and other stakeholders by investing in their development as Purposeful Leaders.  Based on our Purposeful Leader Model©, our purposeful leadership programs are available in multiple delivery modes.
Our team of coaches works with leaders and emerging leaders who seek to improve their lives, relationships, business performance and the world through their leadership impact. Our purpose-led strategy clients often engage us to coach their leadership teams and emerging leaders as part of the process of ensuring their key people are equipped with the capabilities needed to lead within a purpose-led business. We also coach individuals who seek to identify as purposeful leaders and reach out to us of their own initiative.
Research shows that a ‘strong, well-communicated purpose’ can contribute up to a 17% improvement in financial performance. Our team can help you develop an internal communications plan and a range of communications tools to communicate your purpose-led strategy to engage your key stakeholders. We also offer communications coaching to support key leaders responsible for driving purposeful engagement and change.
