I am Trishama Rezwana and I have a little daughter named Aritri who is currently studying in nursery. Aritri has loved the strawberry flavor of Shokti+ Yogurt since she was only 2 years old. Whenever we go to the supermarket, she carries her favorite items in her little cart and Shokti + Doi is always present in it. Shokti + Yogurt is a very healthy snack for my kid.
My daughter’s name is Adira. Adira has always been very picky about food and doesn’t want to eat everything every day, except for Shokti+ Yogurt, which she has been enjoying since the first day. Sometimes she even tries to eat it with a spoon by herself. The attractive packaging and cute cartoons on the packaging make her very interested in eating it.
In a small village in rural Bangladesh, a mother named Fatema struggled to provide nutritious food for her children. Despite working hard on her small farm, she often found it difficult to make ends meet and put food on the table.

Who we are - Grameen Danone
16 years of meaningful journey towards impact creation
Grameen Danone Foods Limited is the first social business enterprise of its kind in the world.
Considering the high rates of micronutrient deficiencies in Bangladeshi children, Franck Riboud (Chairman and CEO of Danone- 2005) and Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus (founder of Grameen microcredit bank and 2006 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate), announced the creation of Grameen Danone Foods Limited by combining the expertise of Danone in dairy and the experience of Grameen in micro-credits for deprived populations.
Founded in March 2006, Grameen Danone Foods Limited started its operation with two broad objectives of providing health through nutrition and creating employment opportunities among vulnerable communities.
Grameen Danone has introduced the brand ‘Shokti+’ in Bangladesh, which is the only Bangladeshi brand that provides fortified yogurt in the market. Our products are fortified with iron, iodine, zinc and vitamin-A ; the most essential nutrients which are generally absent in Bangladeshi population’s diet. In order to scale up its impact, Grameen Danone has also introduced fortified biscuits and other food products in Bangladesh to provide nutrition to all the family members.
We contribute to creating direct employment in its eco-system by purchasing milk from the local farmers and creating employability.
Grameen Danone became B Corp ™ certified in 2018 while proving to balance between its profit and purpose.
GDFL has been operating with two main purposes of providing health through nutrition and creating employment opportunities among vulnerable communities in its eco system. Bringing Health Through Nutrition
In alignment with its mission, Grameen Danone Foods Limited launched the first fortified yogurt in Bangladesh and named it Shokti+ yogurt—designed to deliver 30% of the daily requirement for iron, zinc, vitamin A and iodine—sold at an affordable price through a dense distribution system serving both urban and rural populations to mitigate the nutrition gap , generally found in Bangladeshi population. 
We believe, by producing affordable and nutritious yogurt and biscuits, we are actively participating in improving overall health outcomes, contributing to reduce malnutrition especially in the low-income Bangladeshi families.
Creating employment opportunities in our ecosystem
Grameen Danone Foods Limited is also a source of income for the inhabitants of the surrounding villages: the small farmers sell their milk to the company. Local farmers are provided regular training to help improving their milk production quality and own livelihood.
The production process has been made simple enough to be performed by low-skilled workforce without compromising the quality at any stage of the production.
We encourage an enable women empowerment in the whole value chain of the organization.
Products Fortified with 4 essential Nutrients: 
In Bangladesh, one out of two children suffers from
 high rates of micronutrient deficiencies particularly of vitamin A, iron, iodine and zinc, resulting in an immediate impact on physical and cognitive development .
Our products are fortified with these 4 essential nutrients 
 to cover 30% of daily nutrition needs.
 Helps blood formation and reduces the risk of anaemia,
Our milestones are a reflection of our commitment to this enduring journey.
During a visit in France in 2005, Nobel Laureate Professor Dr. Muhammad Yunus and Mr. Franck Riboud, the then Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Danone decided on the point of forming a joint venture between Grameen and Danone to create something nutritious for the underprivileged children in Bangladesh to mitigate their nutrition gap. The proposed business form was a ‘social business’ that will operate with two main purposes- providing nutrition and creating employment opportunities in the eco-system. Combining the expertise of Danone in dairy and experience of Grameen in micro-credits for deprived populations, in November 2006, Grameen Danone Foods was formed. Throughout the years, Danone Communities have supported Grameen Danone Foods Limited (GDFL) through their financial and managerial expertise.

2019-2021 has been the period of reformation, growth and innovation for Grameen Danone. While the global pandemic had compelled the world to come to a standstill, we continued providing nutrition to the consumers by executing successful door-to-door activities and took necessary measures for ensuring safety of all employees and others in the ecosystem. Studying the growing concern about health and nutrition, we introduced the first ever fortified range of biscuits in Bangladesh, in order to provide nutrition to every member in the family. We have also received awards and recognitions for the community contributions.
We have focused on densifying network strengthening base and experiencing stable growth in all category
