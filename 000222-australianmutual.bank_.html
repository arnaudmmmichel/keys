Ethical conduct has a natural home here
Australian Mutual Bank provides banking services for human and social needs. We operate responsibly and ethically and have done so continuously since we were formed in 1953. In fact, it was the reason we were formed.
Being a mutual bank – run on behalf of our members, who are customers and equal owners – gives us an in-built ethical advantage. Our purpose is to benefit the people who bank with us, not to extract profit from them and distribute it to outside shareholders.
The real deal for our members...
We know that many organisations, not just in banking, are jumping on the "ethical business" trend. Some are genuine about reshaping their conduct. Others see it as little more than a marketing opportunity - and rightly called out for it.
We work to earn the trust of our members by doing what is best for them – encouraging them towards financial products and services that benefit them, and away from financial products and services they don’t need or can’t afford. If our members have financial difficulties, we do what we reasonably can to help them. And when we make a mistake that impacts our members, we acknowledge it, take responsibility for it, and we fix it.
Mutual benefit extends naturally to our employees – many of whom are also members. All our employees, including those in our call centre, are based in Australia and are protected by Australian workplace rights. We provide fair and safe working conditions where people are valued by their contribution, and everyone has an equal opportunity based on their ability and experience. We promote ethical decision-making and never push or tempt staff to behave in a way that is unethical or that undermines our obligations to our members. 
There are many positives to this, including mental health benefits. When people feel they are working with colleagues who are ethical, they have fewer mental health challenges.
To the best of our abilities and resources, we contribute to the wellbeing of our communities and provide a helping hand to those who need it.
While the expression ‘we are all in this together’ has been significantly overused, the fact is that we are. We have a collective responsibility to lift the standards and strengthen the values that make our society a fair and safe place.
In this spirit, Australian Mutual Bank established the Australian Mutuals Foundation. The Foundation supports Australian children and youth, assists remote and disadvantaged communities in impoverished South East Asian and South Pacific countries, and provides a mechanism for members of cooperatives and mutuals, and the general public, to make donations to assist those affected by natural disasters, in Australia or overseas.
For other companies we work with
We prioritise and prefer suppliers and third-party providers who share and live up to the same ethical values we hold. This applies, in particular, to people and organisations that we refer our members to for financial products and services such as insurance and financial planning and advice.
We expect other companies to be honest and transparent in their dealings with us and we reciprocate by adhering to the same standards.
We encourage and support our members to purchase green energy products, such as solar panels, by offering loans at a reduced rate and we are working to expand that to cover more products that reduce the harmful impact of human activity on our planet’s climate. To the extent that we can influence other people's environmental conduct, and be a good role model, we will.
Australian Mutual Bank has a comparatively small environmental footprint. Most of our banking services are now conducted on-line, which reduces the need for physical bank branches, and reduces our use of printed materials.
In line with our ethical approach, we do not invest our members’ funds in industries that may cause harm to the environment or to wildlife, contribute to climate change or hamper efforts to reduce carbon emissions. This extends beyond environmental issues, to areas such as gambling, weapons, and animal testing.
More information about Australian Mutual Bank’s environmental and sustainability credentials can be found in our annual Sustainability Report.
Australian Mutual Bank is a certified B Corp
Australian Mutual Bank was certified as a B Corp in March 2022.
To gain this certification we demonstrated that our words and intentions have been turned into meaningful and measurable actions and that we fulfil our promise to create a positive impact for our members, staff, suppliers, community, and the environment. There are currently 4,200 B Corps in 76 countries and more than 150 industries.

While our intent is always to do what is right, we are far from perfect. There are many ways we can – and will – improve, such as in the way we source the products and services we use to operate our business, how we minimise waste and unnecessary consumption, and where we focus our charity and sponsorship funds. We always welcome your constructive feedback and thoughts on where

Customer Owned Banking Code of Practice
Australian Mutual Bank is a community-based banking organisation that values its members and puts their interests first, providing quality banking, loan and investment services to the community since 1953.
Australian Mutual Bank was formed as a result of a 2019 merger between Sydney Credit Union and Endeavour Mutual Bank. Endeavour Mutual Bank can trace its origins back to 1953 with the formation of the Motor Transport Employees Savings & Loans Co-op. Sydney Credit Union was formed in 1963 to provide employees of the City of Sydney Council with an alternative to banks and pay day lenders.
Australian Mutual Bank Ltd is an Approved Deposit-taking Institution that is regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA) under the Banking Act. The prudential regulator APRA ensures that regulated institutions are safe and sound so that like all banks, Australian Mutual Bank provides deposit accounts that are 
Australian Mutual Bank is also a mutual, that is, an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically-controlled enterprise.
Being a mutual bank – run on behalf of our members, who are customers and equal owners – gives us an in-built ethical advantage. Our purpose is to benefit the people who bank with us, not to extract profit from them and distribute it to outside shareholders. Unlike a major bank, Australian Mutual Bank is not a publicly listed company and as such does not have a primary financial aim of providing dividends to shareholders. This differentiating factor is another benefit of belonging to a mutual and clearly highlights the objective of increasing the value offered to members and their local communities. From a governance perspective once you’re a member you are entitled to an equal say in the running of Australian Mutual Bank. Members have a right to vote at the Annual General Meeting and to elect the Board of Directors - subject to fitness and propriety qualifications, any member can be a director.
At Australian Mutual Bank, we take our corporate social responsibilities seriously, and it is something we are proud of. This includes tailoring products and services to assist in the financial education and growth of the youth and young adult sector, donating to Barnardos to look after disadvantaged or neglected children, as well as upholding our international social responsibility with the direct support of credit union development projects through the Asian Confederation of Credit Unions.
Australian Mutual Bank understands that we all play a part in preserving our environment and we look forward to continually improving our environmental efforts whilst maintaining our position as our members’ preferred banking institution.
Australian Mutual Bank offers all the traditional banking products and services that members have come to expect, whilst keeping up to date with the latest payments advances. These principles have ensured that members continue to benefit from an ever changing banking environment whilst being offered the best possible service.
It is the view of the Board and management that Australian Mutual Bank operates and acts in a responsible and ethical way.
This claim may be justified since:
Members are customers and equal owners of Australian Mutual Bank;
Australian Mutual Bank provides banking services for human and social needs, as opposed to corporate speculative gain;
Australian Mutual Bank is Australian owned and operated;
Australian Mutual Bank does not offshore employees;
Australian Mutual Bank does not invest in fossil fuels, gambling, armaments, persistent chemicals, animal testing;
Australian Mutual Bank supports socially responsible activities (both domestically and internationally).

When a possible intrusion is detected, access to internet banking or mobile banking app may be blocked to protect the account. To reinstate access, please call 13 61 91 during business hours.
We take the protection and security of your information, transaction data and privacy very seriously
Our commitment to your Security and Privacy
We have employed a wide range of security measures to help protect your personal information and transactions. These measures extend from data encryption to firewalls to automatic timeouts. Therefore, when you do your banking online with us, you can be assured that your banking is safeguarded and protected.
In the unlikely event that an unauthorised transaction does occur on your account, we guarantee that you will not be liable for any unauthorised transaction carried out (provided you meet your obligations under our Conditions of Use, the ASIC Electronic Funds Transfer Code of Conduct and you haven't contributed to the loss). It's all part of our commitment to you, our members.
Your Security, We can all play a part
As your financial institution, we take the protection of your information and transaction data very seriously. But online security is a partnership between us (as the provider of online banking services to you) and you (the user of these services). As such, it's important that you do two things:
Technology cannot automatically protect you against all fraud and security risks. A range of email and other online frauds have been attempted over the last few years; these scams will continue and you should be aware of them. Things you can do to keep informed:
Learn about the types of Online Security Risks you may encounter
Equally, technological protection cannot protect you if you are careless with your personal information. You need to play your part in protecting your information responsibly and in accordance with our terms and conditions.
