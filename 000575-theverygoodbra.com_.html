In January 2022 we achieved BCorps certification, a very proud day and a major goal since launch. Read more on the blog!
Great service - I was wearing it less than a week after placing the order.
Colour is lovely, fit is comfortable. This is my third bra from TVGB, and I am very happy with every aspect of them so far.
 V for Victory Bra - Sage 
love love love. Very comfortable and pretty as well. Will definitely be a repeat customer.
Loved this bra. Fits well, very comfortable have been advertising to fellow females already.
I have been holidaying in the Tropics for 6 weeks and only bought my VGB’s with me. 
Best thing is I don’t get sweat build up under my breasts even though the rest of my skin is melting. They seem to wick the moisture away. Another plus for these brilliant bras.
The bra is very comfortable with wide straps. And, as well as helping the environment, because there is no underwire, it means I can go through the scanners at the airport without being 'taken aside'!
 V for Victory Bra - Black Tencel 
Loved the new bra. The fabric was soft, the style was very comfortable. Size was correct. Will definitely buy another when the time comes.
This is a great pair of briefs…extremely comfortable. They are my favorite to wear. I have already purchased two other pairs.
I love this bra. It is very comfortable and I'm happy to finally wear a bra that isn't made with polyester and other synthetic fabrics. My only advice is about sizing. I'm in the US. The sizing chart on the site (in my opinion) is way way off. According to the chart I should get a 14/34 B. I ordered it and the band fit well but the cup size was half (!) what I needed. I normally get 34D US size. So I ended up ordering the 34D from this site and it fit perfectly. I recommend ordering your normal bra size in US measurements. I was able to give away the first purchase and now that I know my size I will order more. I wonder what the 14 means in the 14/34 sizing?
 V for Victory Bra - Grey Marl 
Super soft and comfortable alternative to silk boxer shorts. They’re too short for me to be shorts, and if they were, they’d need pockets!
So Comfy! Definitely my new favourite Bra!
I have been washing the bra every night after work just so I can wear it again the next day - so soft, no annoying wires that dig in and doesn't give me a weird shaped boob! Will absolutely be buying myself a few more.
I absolutely love my new bra. It's soft yet supportive. Very comfy.
 V for Victory Bra - Black Tencel 
There was a problem with the discount code when ordering, which Stephanie resolved within two minutes of me reporting it.  Very impressive for a Friday evening!!!  I was wearing the bra less than a week later :)
It's comfortable, and easy to hand-wash with cold water and a wee bit of soap.
After a few weeks of wearing these bras, my older ones with moulded cups are beginning to feel weirdly thick against my breasts.  I look forward to replacing all of them with V-for-Victory as finances permit.
Absolutely loving the tencel feel and simple elegant black. More colours in this fabric please. (And more uses? Such as singlets and boxer shorts?!)
 V for Victory Bra - Black Tencel 
This bra fits me better than any other one I’ve ever had! 10/10
I have a shoulder injury (not a nursing mother) and love the front opening bra.  Took a little while to get used to the fastening system but now love it.  It would be helpful to have more details of the loop system and how it works on the web site.  Front opening is great for use at the pool too - easier to do up in the change room.
We believe that everything we create should be designed with its end of life in mind. We are unique in that even our elastic, labels, sewing thread and packaging is compostable. Our comfortable bras contain no spandex, and every component has its origin in the earth, to which we hope your bra will in time harmlessly return, rather than add to our landfill burden.
Our wirefree bra fits and supports comfortably across 34 sizes, with no underwire. Our tencel and cotton wirefree bra means that once our customers leave the wire, they rarely go back!
domestic orders over $150, International over $200
Congratulations! Your order qualifies for free shipping
Australians send 85% of textiles to landfill, two thirds of which are man made synthetic fibres like Polyester which take 200 years to break down. We use compostable textiles for our sustainable bra, and compostable packaging, whilst minimising production waste through pre-selling and making only to order - true Slow Fashion!
Awareness is the first step. We all need clothes and we want to feel OK about buying them. Many of us aren't ready to go bra free! Our sustainable bra not only compostable at end of life, but arrive wrapped in recyclable tissue paper and sent in a 100% compostable, or 80% recycled, and recyclable poly mailer.
Before they end up in landfill, synthetic textiles release half a million tonnes of plastic microfibre into our oceans through washing. It is estimated that by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans. We can change this by making better choices about the fabrics we buy and this includes your sustainable bra.
Absolutely thrilled to have received the highest accolade in this prestigious international design award for our revolutionary bra.
The Good Design Awards Jury praised The Very Good Bra, commenting:
“This entry demonstrates strong commitment in ensuring all aspects of the product are full compostable, with zero waste, to create differentiation in their market segment. This is a crucial element for products that can shift the dial on the end-of-life environmental impact, and it is commendable that this is in the lingerie category, which has the opportunity for significant positive impact. The design is appealing and is presented in a manner well suited to their target market. Well done. ”

As someone with generous curves it is very hard to find a comfortable bra that also keeps everything in place. The Victory Bra scores massive points on this. It's so comfortable that sometimes I forget I'm wearing a bra. And for a big girl like me, that's a rare pleasure!
