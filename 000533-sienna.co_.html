Interview With Emma Seibold of Barre Body
Sienna Makes Luxe, Non-Toxic Plant Based Nail Polish.
We bring you our new exclusive plant  based, vegan formula.
Using the latest in cutting edge green science we are proud to present a formula that is made using plant based ingredients with little to no waste by-product. We’re talking about raw ingredients including sugar cane, cassava, cotton and corn.
Building on our pioneering vegan, cruelty-free, non-toxic, Benzo-free, breathable formula, we are now the world’s first, 
nail polish. We are continually innovating to make sure we are bringing you the best quality products, that’s healthy for people and the planet too. Read more about commitment in 
Our range of more than 50 colours is inspired by the natural, organic beauty of Byron Bay. We hope you love them as much as we love bringing them to you.
Is Sienna nail polish cruelty-free & vegan?
Did you know that a company can be vegan but not cruelty-free? Confusing isn’t it! Cruelty-free refers to not testing on animals, whereas vegan means not including animal or animal by-products within ingredients.
Sienna nail polish is proudly both vegan certified and 
 which are all auditing bodies who verify the high standards we set for ourselves. We created our entire range so that you can have peace of mind that our products are of the highest quality for you and don’t harm our animal friends.
Why doesn't Sienna use the 7, 8, 10, 12, 21 free labelling system?
When non-toxic nail polish arrived in the market, the ‘X-free’ branding was used to show customers the number of chemicals a polish is ‘free’ from.
Unfortunately, without a regulatory body for this type of branding it is fast becoming a race to include as much as possible in the ‘x free’ calculation and some brands have started including ingredients that are not commonly found in nail polish. Therefore, we have decided to not label and let our ingredients list do the talking. We go into this in more depth in our 
So don’t be fooled by a big ‘x-free’ number. Take a look at each brands formula to ensure you’re getting a true natural and non-toxic nail polish.
Is Sienna nail polish natural & non-toxic?
Sienna stands strongly by our formula and is proud to be a natural and non-toxic nail polish brand that is the cleanest brand on the market globally.
We have always been free of formaldehyde, dbp, toluene, tosylamide/formaldehyde resin, synthetic camphor, xylene and benzophenone -1. We are also accredited by the 
safe cosmetics australia (the toxic-free campaign)
 and our mission is to ensure that our formula supports your health, planet and your manis!
And if you still don’t take our word for it, we are certified by made safe who have analysed every single ingredient and deemed us the cleanest. Simply put, we want you to be able to enjoy luxe, high-quality natural nail polish that’s free of nasties and available in a beautiful range of organic colours. What more could you want?
Are you halal certified and is your formula breathable?
Yes! We are halal certified by halal certification services and our nail polishes are independently tested to be breathable and water permeable through osmosis, thus they are wudu friendly.
Our polish has been scientifically tested to ensure osmosis occurs all the way through to the nail bed itself. Note this is not visible to the naked eye and the commonly used coffee paper saturation tests are not accurate. Osmosis happens through gently permeating the nail polish film so your nail bed will be touched by water.

For a subtle spring look, light pink nail polish with its delicate hues is a sweet and simple statement. As the weather heats up, go for bright, fun-loving hot pink; or for that perfect neutral look, try our clear pink nail polish, which is the perfect blend of chic and understated that keeps you feeling glamorous all summer long. As autumn approaches, switch your style up to pink nail polish with some red/orange hues, drawing out the last of that summer glow. In the deepest of winters, captivate onlookers with a bolder dark pink nail polish that exudes its warmth and strength from the tips of your fingers.

Our clear pink nail polish can add a touch of style and flair to your next French manicure, or you can keep things simple with our Sweetheart shade, which also makes a great nail art base.
