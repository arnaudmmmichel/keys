So What is CoLocal? | CoLocal powered by BizBuddyHub | TidyHQ

So What is CoLocal? | CoLocal powered by BizBuddyHub | TidyHQ
So you are wondering what CoLocal is all about? If you google it in scientific terms it means occurring in the same cell. We think this is kind of apt as community advocates with a passion for creating connection and collaboration and a strong inclusive community that can live and work and support one another in the local space. 
Our journey over the last few years has seen a number of us collaborate with many local stakeholders and work on lots of local projects, that have delivered or created fantastic outcomes, built social cohesion, advocated for better resources and amenities etc. and we wondered how we could create a better, scalable system to work together. 
This video below on Collective Impact by CMM Social Change explains how we work in an easy to understand way:
We often see many hardworking individuals, community groups, local business and local organisations working hard in disparate ways to solve common problems. Rather than work separately, bringing together like-minded individuals,  the dreamers and doers, can create greater social impacts.
We aim to build capacity and shared resources that allow our community to do more together, aligning a shared vision that creates a sense of belonging and pride and encourages a supportive local economy.
Leading by example and creating a strong vision and mission supported by a viable governance structure that focuses on accountability, transparency, and the bigger picture and leverages partnerships and collaboration. 
We intend to template this process so we can build capacity and support and auspice others to do the same.
We will be building our structure to support social procurement at the local level too! We know how hard it is for local, micro businesses and social enterprises to apply for tenders on their own and we know this needs to be supported from an agency perspective to enable pre-qualified local skills access to this bigger contracts and tenders. 
We want to focus on building a values based organisation around real people, strengthening our communities to be able to be self-supporting and sustainable. We cannot change the world but we figure we can work on making our local communities inclusive and supportive.  
Is there room at the table? Hell Yeah! We need skills, partners, associates and sponsors who share a like-minded vision and are invested in seeing strong supportive systems working together. 
 and help us build CoLocal - after all Local is at the Heart of what we do!

With such a young family make up with as much as 70% having to spend up to 2-4 hours a day commuting to jobs in the city and beyond we believe much more can be done to create local solutions to work in your own post code and to be able to truly live, work, shop and support local while collaborating globally.
The video below is an example of the work we have done to highlight this to Local, State and Federal government. Since the pandemic has created a paradigm shift towards working from home we believe the next step to be to see how we can shift this to working in your own postcode. We also put in a

Point Cook Pop Up Park | CoLocal powered by BizBuddyHub | TidyHQ
Point Cook is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia and is home to over 60 000 people (2019) from 160 different ethnicities. It also has a very young demographic of families with over a third of the population under 14 years of age. Interestingly, it is also the online shopping capital in Australia 
Point Cook Pop Up Park (PCPUP) was an idea proposed to 
Connect the Heart of the Community
 and create a focal point to congregate and get to know one another, and support our local traders. Catalysed through Melbourne placemaking consultancy - 
, PCPUP was successfully piloted in 2018, and has since been actively supported by local community members and is a popular pop up space amongst locals and visitors alike.

We are proud that the pop up park held its own as a safe space for the community to gather through out the pandemic and that in 2022 we are able to transition to a permanent space and revitalisation due to support, partnership and funding from Stockland, Victoria State Government Living Local Fund and Wyndham City Council.

Point Cook Mural | CoLocal powered by BizBuddyHub | TidyHQ
The Point Cook mural is a 39 panel installation spanning the southern side of Murnong Street along the 
 at Stockland Point Cook Shopping Centre. Portraying the diverse wildlife and flora of the region, it draws special attention to how the Point Cook community interact with their local landscapes.  
The mural began as part of a collaboration with the University of Melbourne (UniMelb) in 2019, where masters students from the 'Regenerative Sustainability' program were invited to pitch their vision of regenerative placemaking to Pop Up Park organisers. The winning group presented the idea of a 'paint by numbers' mural to be completed by community members, with an experienced artist to create a design tying together all the regenerative elements from the University of Melbourne partnership into a physical embodiment and legacy of the project.
The UniMelb team began by reaching out to the local community to gather their stories and memories of living in Point Cook. These became the inspiration for the mural, surrounded by animals and plants native to the area. Melbourne artist Clare Ellison Jakes Cej's design seeks to showcase some of the common and unique elements of the Point Cook environment, including the coastal reserve, wetlands, marine sanctuary and the critically endangered Orange-bellied Parrot.
Over four weeks in February and March 2020, a team from Point Cook and the University of Melbourne scrubbed, sprayed, painted and repainted the 39 panels, assisted by wonderful local artists, volunteers and passers-by who joined in for a day or a lunch break to take up a paintbrush and bring the local ecology into the heart of Point Cook.

COVID-19 saw an impact on our third iteration of the Point Cook Pop Up Park, with over 30% of events and activities cancelled in 2020. As we strived to find alternatives to deliver these activities post-lockdown in a COVID-safe manner, we immediately knew things would need to change in the long term. 
This turned out to be the case as, Melbourne grew to love their outdoor spaces and with growing popularity for outdoor dining as Victoria's businesses slowly re-opened, we worked closely with Wyndham City Council and local key stakeholders to quickly scale up 3 projects:
To date, we have managed over 157 events including community goodwill events, family activities, outdoor movies, multicultural events and  a wide range of live music by local musician and performers. These events were challenging to organise with COVID-safe requirements, sudden re-schedulings with snap lockdowns and various auspice/support arrangements. However, the smiles and laughter these events bring to our community, as well as the flow of visitors to our local businesses is why we do what we do!

are proud to announce that we have teamed up to help more communities to improve their places in Victoria. It’s a tricky time all over the world and never has it been more important to think about where we live, how we navigate our way through COVID and re-imagine the way we want our “Local Neighbourhood” and community to look and feel.
Town Teams are positive and proactive community groups that are open to businesses, landowners, and residents. They work collaboratively with their local government to improve a place or area, often a town centre or ‘main street’. They are catalysts for positive change and are focused on 
The only requirement to be a Town Team is to align with and live the 
. The charter is a shared story of what Town Teams are and how they should behave. It helps explain our movement’s collective values and expectations. It’s a summary of the ‘Town Team Way’.
This partnership will shape a movement of citizen-led action focused on creating connected, resilient communities and better places. Working along Town Team principles, CoLocal will grow the movement of local teams and will draw on the experience, expertise, and collaboration with Town Team Movement on Victorian-based projects.
