meta title:We Are August - Learn About Us | August
meta description:Hello. We're August. We love to execute smart strategies and build valuable business solutions.

We Are August - Learn About Us | August
A decade of digital marketing experience and hundreds of projects gives us the right to call it as we see it.
We’ve built a business immersed in successful digital marketing solutions. You know your business better than we ever can. Together, we can create something epic. Let’s build a relationship on collaboration, creativity and technical superiority.
We’re street-smart and we know our stuff but we also like to think things through. A strategic approach with effective tactical execution wins every time.
We love to execute smart strategies and build valuable business solutions. We’re proud to say that the quality of our work and the relationships we build, drives repeat and referral business. There is no better measure of success.
We love building useful solutions. Our values underpin everything we do. Our approach, clarity of thought, refinement of ideas, thorough planning, veracity and high-calibre execution show that we mean business.
If that sounds august, you’re right. We are.
5 THINGS YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT US
We've been independent and proud since 2005 - and we've got the T-shirt to prove it.
We've shown the world that accessible, standards-compliant websites can rock.
We've developed processes that mean we're both fast and high quality. Yes, you really can have both.
. We're making it our business to know all there is to know about accessibility.
Creativity is the lifeblood of our business. We believe everyone is creative and everyone can contribute ideas.
Daniel takes a holistic approach to business – his own and that of August’s clients. A forward-thinking, quietly ambitious individual, you’ll find Dan reaching into his treasure chest of ideas to make August a better place to work. As a co-founder of August, Dan uses his leadership skills to partner with clients to create award-winning products that exceed expectations.
With a background in strategy, user-centred interaction, service and experience design, marketing, and brand management, Dan is a driving force behind August.
A thought-leader and dreamer, Dan is a strategic thinker and doer who is constantly asking the question: “How can we do it better?”
In his spare time, you’ll find him reading up on new technology, exploring the creative process, enjoying the great outdoors, or running through a national park. He has been known to talk about WODs, squats and burpees at the weekly team meeting.
Zoë thinks, creates and delivers in pixels for August’s clients and their audiences. A fast-moving, quick-thinking creative with a deep communications background, Zoë chooses to meld her business nous with her philanthropic heart. In both worlds, she loves nothing more than engineering an organisation’s online presence to create meaningful touch points and conversations with its audiences.
As co-founder and director, Creative Services, at August, Zoë is one of the lynchpins of the August crew.
Her extra-curricular activities are many and include a regular gig co-hosting and commenting on all things digital for ABC Radio 774Melbourne, Radio National and other programs.
In the industry where she made her mark, Zoë feeds her soul by mentoring young talent. Zoë is program director of the V21 Digital Summit, ambassador for Yarra Valley Open Studios, a guest lecturer at RMIT, Swinburne and Monash Universities, Chair of the Swinburne University Multimedia Course Advisory Committee and Vice President for the Australian Interactive Media Industry Association (AIMIA). She regularly writes and presents for organisations such as 
B&T, Australian Creative Magazine, Marketing Magazine
, ad:tech, AIMIA National Industry Events and Sponsorship Australasia.
Zoe might live and breathe in a digital world, but the real world is her playground. In her spare time, she partakes in Melbourne’s vibrant food and arts scene, rescues animals for Wildlife Victoria and twirls fire (though not at the same time).
Matt takes a pragmatic, big-picture view of the technical aspects of a project. One of August’s founding members, he is a problem solver in every sense of the term. At his desk, headphones on, you’ll find him quietly analysing, creating and building things, looking for ways to make the complex simple.
Overseeing a talented group of front and back-end developers, Matt adopts a lead role in designing, developing and managing sophisticated web-based products for August’s diverse group of clients.
As the chief architect of August’s network and application-development structure, Matt has more than 15 years’ industry experience. He balances technical limitations with the best outcome for the client in all the solutions we build. When every project is different, it’s a role where out-of-the-box solutions collide with tailored outcomes. No development stone is left unturned under Matt’s watchful eye.
When he’s not building online solutions to help save water, redesigning an iconic Melbourne landmark, or ensuring websites are WCAG 2.0 compliant, you’ll find him building spaceships and animal kingdoms at home with his young family.
We're not in it for the glory, but we've won and been shortlisted for some killer 'gongs'. And it makes us proud of the work we do.

meta title:We Know Digital | August
meta description:August is a technology-led creative company. For the past decade, we've been crafting idea led strategic digital marketing solutions.

August is a technology-led creative company.
We exist to champion your organisation.
To reinvigorate, reconstruct and refresh your brand. To inspire, innovate
In a world where technology is driving creative, we’ve been crafting idea-led, strategic solutions for the past decade.
It isn’t just digital, it’s the practical application of ideas, strategy, execution
At August, our approach is simple.
Learn everything about your business to create a meaningful plan to achieve your goals and objectives. We partner with our clients. Together, we can produce awesome work.
We draw on our expertise in digital, technology, marketing and communications to devise business and marketing strategies that are effective and measurable for our clients.
Our creative team are experts at refreshing and reinvigorating tired brands, or bringing new ideas to life. We align your creative vision with your business goals to create meaningful visuals that stand out from the pack.
We take a ‘user always comes first’ approach when designing a solution for your business. Understanding the habits, behaviours and motivation of your audience is integral to the success of any project and a key driver of the August process.
Our information architects devise, structure, organise and label content in a way that enhances the user experience on screens big and small.
Our heritage lies in technology. We have an indepth understanding of harnessing the latest technology to meet your business requirements. If something’s not a good fit, or there’s a better option out there, we’ll say so.
We craft tangible stuff that engages your audience.
Design, words, images and code intersect to create unique experiences across multiple platforms.
Design is more than just the pretty placement of text and images. It’s art. From design concept to delivery, we craft the interactive elements to get the experience right. That means words, photography, typography and iconography all tied into a simple, elegant design that champions your business and makes your brand hum.
We use wireframes to kickstart our creative process and get complex ideas across simply. By stripping back the elements to black and white and shades of grey, we validate the fundamentals of your project so the design meets your objectives.
Art direction means your work is sharp and stays sharp. Our art directors follow the design process every step of the way, ensuring your project is super-polished, finessed and ready to meet the world.
Need clear direction across photography and videography? Our design team talk the talk to lead the visuals for a consistent on-brand result.
The user is front and centre of everything we do. Across all digital and communication touch points, we make it our mission to give them a pleasurable, intuitive, valuable experience that resonates.
‘Content’ – the very word has the ability to strike fear into the hearts of many businesses. Words aren’t scary, but it’s important to get them right. We help you curate and craft content to connect to your customers and clearly communicate your message.
We build and deliver digital platforms and services that people use every day. We combine design and technology to engineer solutions that enable business. We’ve been doing so for almost a decade.
We’ve built and delivered hundreds of websites for clients across a range of industries, markets and government sectors. We’ve integrated with existing internal systems and legacy applications, and developed websites from the inkling of an idea. Trust us. We’ve got this one covered.
The screen might be smaller but our thought process is just as rigorous. We architect, design and develop mobile applications that find the balance between creative expression and technical constraints to promote a positive user experience and better engagement with your product.
‘One size fits all’ isn’t in our DNA. Whether that’s WordPress, Magento, Expression Engine, Squiz or a bespoke CMS, we build robust platforms on the system that make sense for your project.
We pride ourselves on building fully integrated eCommerce platforms with robust front and back in systems that put your customer first.
We take the security of your website super-seriously. We have robust hosting solutions dedicated to the security of your business.
We apply appropriate load testing and scaling measures to a site before its live to ensure that any issues are found in this area before users can identify them. The level of load testing we apply differs with each project and will always depend on our clients’ requirements.
We bring ideas to life to help you grow your business.
How? We use our analytic, creative and marketing skills to open up the conversation with your customers.
We take a holistic approach to driving your digital strategy and marketing further.Technology is merely one of the tools of our trade. Ideas and execution are the glue that hold it all together. Our strength and experience is in designing and implementing online activity in a way that maps back to an organisation’s business objectives.
For most businesses, ‘social’ is no longer a nice-to-have. It is a way to project your company’s voice, connect with current fans and reach even more customers. We spend the time to understand what you stand for as a business, and build social campaigns that ensure your voice is heard far
‘Content’ isn’t just words on a page; it’s everything a customer sees about your brand, the voice in which you communicate your message. From articles to images, infographics to video, we help you develop content that keeps customers coming back again and again.
Almost every website relies on search engines to generate visits. Search engine optimisation (SEO) ensures your website comes up when your customers are searching. We work with you to properly optimise your website and develop long term SEO campaigns to keep improving your visibility in search engines.
As the saying goes, “you can’t manage what you don’t measure”, so analytics is at the core of everything we do. We ensure your analytics systems are set up to track user interactions specific to your business, giving us reporting that contains real insight into your current and potential customers.
EDMs are a great way to communicate with your customers, but there’s a real science behind it, and it’s a science that we have been studying for years. We understand why people open emails, why people click on them and how to ensure people love receiving them.

meta title:Work With Us | August
meta description:August is an award-winning technology-led creative company. Come and join us. We think you'll like it here.

If you like what you see, we’d love to hear from you even if a role is not currently available. We’re always on the lookout for talented people who get what we do and want to help us do it better.
A new opportunity has opened up within our team to be one of the custodians of our internal systems. You'll be ensuring the tech, gear, and software we use remains best practice, is well maintained, and delights our team and clients.
Imagine this – it’s Monday morning. You’re working from the office today and you have a smile on your face as you leave your home for the trip into work. You know that when you arrive, you’ll be spending the day tinkering with the latest in technology software, security, production kit, and computers. You’ll be sharing a beverage of your choice with team mates who are excited to tell you about a client launch that’s about to happen or a workshop that will be hosted later in the week. You love these conversations because you’re aware that you’ll be part of these events during the week. Whether it’s ensuring the workshop set up has all the remote facilities it needs or reinforcing some of our technology infrastructure for an upcoming launch – you feel connected in the team.
This is a highlight of what life is like as an Augie, and particularly what life could be like for you if you become our Internal Systems Administrator. We have done a lot of work over the last few years to establish a strong foundation in latest hardware, a standard operating system, and delighting our clients with technology that is seamless. If you’re someone who is always looking for ways to make this area of a business better, more effective, maybe even more automated…and you’d like to do that within a team that values belonging, effort, and play, then we’d love to hear from you.
This role in the words of August team members
It’s not every day you get to hear about a role from the person who was in it, or who they work with. Take a look at these behind the scenes chats to learn more about this unique Internal Systems Administrator role and the quality team you’ll be working with.
The job in 55 words or less
Set up and maintenance of team hardware - we're all Mac users and this will include support systems for provisioning our Standard Operating System.
Studio hardware management - docking stations at our desks, monitors, conference hardware (we have a pretty awesome kit), and content studio hardware.
User account management - setting up new August team members, making safe prior user accounts, day to day maintenance via on site DC and Office 365.
Ensuring the in house network system is top notch - fileservers, back ups, studio internet connection, and VPN. 
Minimum 6 years' experience in a Sys Admin or DevOps Engineer role (if you have slightly less experience, we still encourage you to apply!) 
Experience with, and an interest in, continuing to improve data and infrastructure security practices for our clients and us.
Participating in a supportive culture where team conversations can revolve around belonging and feedback. 
While you can work autonomously, team and client connection and communication is important to you. 
A desire to learn new technologies, to push/challenge the technical capability within our team and to grow with the role, regardless of your experience. 
Tertiary qualifications in Computer Science or Electronics Engineering experience with set up and management of open source software stacks. 
Set up and training in AI models 
Working at August is not just another agency job. While we take our work seriously, we really enjoy the company of the people we work with and we don’t take 
 too seriously. It takes time to find the right people to join our team. There’s a level of trust and flexibility that is hard to describe, but here goes nothing. You’ll enjoy the freedom to create and contribute to sophisticated projects the way you want, combined with a robustness of process that ensures you have total support to focus all your energy and inspiration on compelling design and technical challenges. If you’d like more detail, we’d love you to ask us about it!
Our values play an important part in everything we do at August. They help us deliver epic work for clients around the world and they’ve seen us through some difficult times. As a team member, you’ll continue to develop not just your technical craft, but other valuable qualities such as powerful communication skills, commercial and business nous, and handy insights into totally random stuff, like a quick and easy killer dumpling recipe, or the engineering magic behind the latest SpaceX test flight (again, you might want to ask us!). When we hire someone to join the team, we’re interested and invested in all the different parts that make up you – because ultimately, that’s what makes August.
As a team member, you can also expect:
A competitive salary package with various incentives and rewards.
Flexible and hybrid working is part of our daily jam.
Working within a highly motivated, talented and technology–driven team.
A team of people who will invest in your career progression
Generous company policies that help you grow and balance life.
Many other perks we will discuss when we meet you.
Applications for this role are open now and we are actively hiring to fill this spot in our team.
If you have questions about this role or about August, feel free to contact us and ask for Sarah.
To apply for this position, you need to:
Mention one of our clients in your application.
Provide your CV, outlining your skills and experience.
Include a covering letter explaining why you are perfect for this role.
If you have a personal website or folio site, feel free to include it in your application; we’d love to check it out.
We understand you work in a competitive industry and you will be tempted to contact us with potential candidates for this and other listed roles. We respectfully request that you do not contact us regarding applicants for
this role and please do not send us unsolicited applications.
August is an independent award-winning digital consultancy headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. We aim to nudge the world just enough to make a change. Help us to make it happen.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at August. We don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
A rare opportunity has opened up (seriously, this one is rare) to work within our high performing technology-led team where your role is focused on maintaining and growing the latest in good infrastructure technology and practices - both for our clients and us.
No one at August has titles so this was was a tricky role to name! There are however, some titles you could attribute to this role that would make sense to someone outside August. These titles would sound like Hosting SysAdmin, Hosting Manager, Systems Administrator, DevOps Hosting…you get where we’re going?
You’ll become a custodian of our client hosting infrastructure and be able to deliver support that makes the Nights Watch look…a little tame. This role works predominantly with Hashistack in AWS. If you don’t have experience with that, don’t worry – we’re known for investing in our team and we’ll onboard you plus ensure you’re always supported. We’re a team after all.
When you’re working with the other developers and helping them out on code deploys, you’ll be working in your familiar environments of GitHub, BuildKite, and Docker. We love open source and expect that you do too if you’re reading this.
The August team is smart and nimble; working together to help our clients change and build innovative applications. We are committed to learning and sharing something new every day.
While we expect this to be a full time role, we’re always open to chatting about part time options.
DevOps Engineers work within our diverse team to ensure our infrastructure is top notch and our clients are receiving the best experience we can provide them. We are fixated on improving our clients’ outcomes. We expect that you’re someone who values this as well.

August is an independent award-winning digital consultancy headquartered in Melbourne, Australia. We aim to nudge the world just enough to make a change. Help us to make it happen.
We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at August. We don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
Are you an experienced Product Designer looking for your next big career challenge? Be part of the foundation team launching our new product to market! You'll be working closely with a niche user base solving complex problems. This is a bold project with lots of room to grow and contribute.
We are excited to be launching a production management system made specifically for agencies and professional service firms that have adopted a hybrid agile methodology. This role provides you with the opportunity to work on sophisticated and complex problems – rather than designing individual product features, you’ll understand that owning the design process from the ground up is needed. More importantly, bringing people along and making it a team effort in that process is critical to the success of our work together.
No one works on anything alone when you’re an August team member. You’ll be expected to collaborate and contribute – for someone who thrives in this type of environment, you’ll be driven to add to the fabric of our strong culture and quality work through your commitment to learning and delivering.
Before we jump into more specifics of the role, it’s important we let you know about our hybrid way of working. We maintain flexible work practices and have done so since the company started in 2005. Hybrid working for us means that our Senior Product Design role is based in our Melbourne office and will work predominantly with our Australian and New Zealand team. However, you are not expected to work in the office or remote full time. Teams self-manage their face to face time and we also ensure that the company is up to date with all COVID-safe practices including vaccination requirements, cleaning, and physical distancing requirements.

Establish ways of working within the product team in your first few months that provides context and room for growth and scalability
Proven experience designing software that tackles complex problems and is used by people; in other words, this isn’t your first product
Collaboration is a skill and a way of working that enables you to collect feedback, give feedback, and convert conversations into productive design discussions. 
You are focused on human-centred design when it comes to solving product issues; product design is great, but if it’s not solving a person’s problem then it’s not helpful.
Excited by the opportunity to contribute to a senior and experienced team in developing ways of working, processes and feedback mechanisms.
You know the best practice tools of the trade and you use them everyday including (but not limited to) Figma, Principle, Sketch and more…
Can work autonomously but loves being part of a team and actively contributing to it

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at August. We don’t discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.
If you’ve landed on this page, you must be interested in work experience. That’s great. But if you’ve come straight here, perhaps go back and have a look around before reading further. Trust us, it will help. Why? Because before you apply, you need to understand what we’re about.
We are big advocates of learning and pushing yourself to be better. Work experience is valuable in the formative years of your career or as you’re nearing the end of high school. It gives you the opportunity – however brief – to be immersed in a company you admire, learn how the company operates, gain an insight into working life and meet people that could help influence your career.
Work experience placements at August are available in June each year.
We take work experience seriously. You’ll be assigned tasks that have a direct impact on the business. Whether it’s assisting with client projects, internal work or being part of team discussions – you’ll be doing much more than just filing or getting coffee.
With that in mind, opportunities here are rare. We don’t advertise, but we do welcome applications from people who push the boundaries with their application.
We want you to stand out. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never done work experience before. Show us why you’re different and why we simply shouldn’t say “no” to you.
Things to consider when approaching us about work experience:
If you submit online, follow up with a phone call.
If at first you don’t succeed, it’s okay to try again at a later date.
Be brave and make contact yourself – don’t ask someone else to call on your behalf.
Research interview etiquette and tips – it could just help you stand out.
Show us that you’ve learnt about August as a company and what we stand for.
Be creative in your approach to us.
Everyone that works at August has one goal: help build amazing experiences and services that delight and surprise people. If we achieve that on a daily basis, we think we’re doing all right.
Whatever your role, you’ll partner directly with clients to help them achieve their business aims.
You’ll collaborate with a smart, nimble team that excels at building innovative, technology-led solutions. And you’ll bring along your own personal brand of talent, skills and awesomeness to the mix.
Courses, seminars and conferences, and other ways to make you think and grow.
We don’t tell you how to manage your time, we just expect that you’ll own your situation.
Our offices are open-plan spaces that foster collaboration, communication, and plenty of laughs. You can also work from home when it suits you. From 2020, we've all worked from home due to COVID-19 restrictions - creating collaborative spaces online and still maintaining plenty of laughs!
There’s a reason why our interview process is intense. We work hard to choose the right people.
 It’s important to us that you stay informed of what’s going on in your industry, so we’re here to help you develop those networks.
We’re friends as well as colleagues and like to hang out after hours. We often see a movie, do trivia, or just head to the pub for a cold one.
Nine out of 10 doctors recommend pets for relaxation and stress-relief. We made that up, but Suki, the office dog, makes us smile.
 ‘Work’ is only one part of it.
‘Augies’ is the collective noun for the group of individuals that come to work each day at August. We are Augies because we love what we do, we work hard to make things better, and we never stop learning.
Our team is made up of a bunch of cross-disciplinary stars that shine across all areas of the business.
You’ll find thinkers and doers in marketing, digital design and brand, legal design, web development and systems, strategy, management consulting, content, and copywriting.
No rockstars. Everyone works together, everyone shares knowledge.
Everyday, our people are entrusted with every element of August’s operations and we are proud of the results they achieve.
