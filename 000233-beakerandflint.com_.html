meta title:About
meta description:N/A

Mac and I met while working for an app development agency back in 2014. With his skills for organisation and leadership, and my insatiable desire to grow through entrepreneurship, we knew a perfect partnership was brewing.
Fast forward to 2018, and we 
 together. Weâve since delivered over 50 discreet technology projects for startups, scaleups and large enterprises. We've helped blue-chip global brands improve the way they deliver technology.
Above all else, hiring and managing people who can accelerate your critical projects is what we do best.
Because hereâs the thing: our main goal is to build YOUR capability, not our portfolio (although thatâs still nice).
And if you want to hear from someone who has been there before, read about one of our most successful projects yet.
