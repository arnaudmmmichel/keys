Client Story | Payment Logic | BlueRock
BlueRock assisted Payment Logic in a successful capital raise to fuel their global growth plans. Find out more about this innovative business and how BlueRock helped them on their business adventure.
Payment Logic, led by CEO Sam Plowman, has created a highly secure and efficient platform that allows businesses and individuals to utilise their American Express cards or debt to process any type of payment, while also earning reward points effortlessly and securely. 
With Payment Logic's innovative approach, payment processes are improved, creating a new marketplace for business owners to save time, optimise cash flow and reduce payment fraud and error, all while also accumulating rewards in the daily running of their business.
With plans to expand its operations, Payment Logic sought to expand their platform and build new products. To materialise this strategy, the company recognised the importance of raising capital to fuel its growth. Seeking expert guidance, Payment Logic engaged BlueRock to assist them in securing the necessary investment.
Payment Logic's primary objectives were twofold: to grow its business locally and to establish an advisory team that could offer valuable insights for their strategic direction and governance. Regular meetings revealed a critical concern faced by many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the need to devise effective ways to reward their high-performing teams. BlueRock is familiar with this challenge working closely with many SME businesses, and the need to ensure that they are providing an incentive system to motivate and retain talented employees.
BlueRockâs advice played a pivotal role in guiding Payment Logic through a successful capital raise before the pandemic, providing the company with sufficient funds to see them through this period. The capital infusion proved instrumental in diversifying their revenue streams and laying the foundation for future growth.
Building upon this initial success, we recently collaborated on a second capital raise, demonstrating our commitment to supporting Payment Logic's ambitions for local expansion and potential international growth. Throughout our partnership, we have maintained a close relationship, regularly participating in bi-monthly advisory meetings as external advisors to the board. During these sessions, our focus has encompassed crucial aspects such as financial performance, people and culture, brand, sales and marketing, operations, and the overarching growth strategy.
Early in our engagement, we identified the importance of safeguarding Payment Logic's intellectual property and provided valuable assistance in restructuring the business accordingly. Moreover, recognising the significance of attracting and retaining top talent, we worked closely with Payment Logic to develop an employee stock ownership plan. This plan has proven to be an effective means of not only rewarding their high-performing team but also serving as a powerful incentive for continued excellence.
Despite the challenges brought by the pandemic, Payment Logic has grown by 50% cumulatively post-COVID-19, processing over $2 billion in payments across all its products. Theyâre now in a position to go for a second capital raise to push the business forward and pursue global growth.
The partnership between BlueRock and Payment Logic has exemplified the impact of strategic advisory support in fostering sustained growth and success. By leveraging our expertise, Payment Logic has thrived in the face of challenges, ensuring its continued expansion and prominence in the competitive payment processing landscape.

meta title:What It Means To Be B Corp Certified | BlueRock
meta description:Considering B Corp certification for your business? Learn what itâs all about, from a professional services B Corp â one of the first financial services businesses in Australia to achieve certification.

What It Means To Be B Corp Certified | BlueRock
          What It Means To Be B Corp Certified
Heard the term âB Corpâ being thrown around? Wondering what it means and what it represents? At BlueRock weâve been B Corp certified for 6 years, and we just got re-certified! So grab your popcorn, get comfy, and let us explain what a B Corp is, why we pursued B Corp status, and what becoming one could mean for your business. Teaserâ¦itâs been amazing!
B Corps, or Certified B Corporations, are the cool kids of the business world! B Lab, the team behind the B Corp movement, has given them the stamp of approval for being the epitome of socially and environmentally responsible, transparent, and accountable companies. The "B" in B Corp stands for "benefit," which is what these businesses are all about â balancing profit and purpose to benefit everyone, including people, communities, and the planet.
Think of it this way â B Corps are future-focused, always striving to do better and hold themselves to a higher standard. They're part of a tight-knit community of over 470 companies across Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, representing industries from accounting to waste management â all passionate about making a positive impact in the world.
Why is BlueRock a Certified B Corporation?
At BlueRock, we believe that business can be a force for good, and we're all about making that a reality! As a growing entrepreneurial firm, we're not just focused on numbers â we see the value in balancing our company's purpose and profit to create a positive impact on the world. With a community of over 350 passionate BlueRockers, we're a tight-knit group of dreamers and doers who love what we do.
 approaches, weâre proud to have been re-certified as a B Corporation for the next three years. While itâs not about the status, Founder and CEO, Peter Lalor, always envisioned BlueRock seeking to doing things better and the B Corp framework is a great way to hold ourselves accountable for this. âThe goal for BlueRock was to make it a great place to work while also supporting a sustainable and healthy planet. With our people-first culture being what sets BlueRock apart, B Corp gives us the opportunity to enter a community and space where like-minded and future-focused businesses go beyond the norm,â Lalor said. 
Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, BlueRock remained steadfast and powered through, with the support of an incredible community of employees, clients and partners. And, when we say we love what we do, we mean it. We're passionate about creating a workplace that attracts and retains the best clients and team members. One of our core values is to always give back to the community, which we also do through our

 means rethinking what success in business means. Sure, revenue and profit are important, crucial in fact, but there's a greater opportunity to create prosperity for all. To achieve this certification, a business must undergo a rigorous B Impact Assessment (BIA) that evaluates its impact in the areas of governance, workers, environment, community, and customers. 
The BIA considers all aspects of a company's operations and its effect on stakeholders, and the questions vary based on the company's industry, size, and location. 
If you pass the test with flying colours (aka score at least 80 out of 200), you get to wear the B Corp Seal with pride for the next 3 years. This lets your customers and employees know that they're supporting a business that's not just in it for the money, but also to make a positive impact on the world. 
What Does Being B Corp Certified Mean For You and Your Business?
If you become a B Corp, youâll join a unique community of over 3,200 companies from 64 countries spanning 150 industries. This certification is a symbol of a company's commitment to creating a better world through its business practices.
businesses are increasingly expected to contribute to societal and environmental change
, B Corp certification provides a way to measure and communicate a company's impact. B Corp leaders believe that sustainable business is good business and use their companies as a force for good.
By obtaining B Corp certification, customers trust that a company has met strict standards for accountability, transparency, and performance in areas such as employee benefits, supply chain practices, and charitable giving. This means that the business operates in a way that benefits all stakeholders, not just its owners and shareholders.
By being a B Corp, you are joining a movement towards a sustainable future aligned with ESG and SDG goals. This certification can help attract employees and clients who share your commitment to sustainability and social change and allow you to be transparent about your impact.
