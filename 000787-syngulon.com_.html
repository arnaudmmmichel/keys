Dr. van Melderen studies bacterial environmental adaptation and the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation through the study of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems and their relevance to persistence, and global regulation of gene expression of central carbon metabolism and biofilm formation. Our work overlaps as bacteriocins can behave similarly to TA systems; both produce compounds capable of killing the host or other cells, and in both systems an antidote (or immunity protein in the case of bacteriocins) protects the producing cell. Additionally, understanding the interplay of bacteriocins and biofilms will allow us to increase the potency of our system. We work with Dr. Van Melderen’s lab to study bacteriocins from

Dr. André uses yeast to decipher the detailed mechanisms underlying cellular functions. They apply state-of-the-art genomic, proteomic, and cellular biology techniques to study the plasma membrane proteins involved in the detection and transport of the molecules from the extracellular milieu, including the role of ubiquitin in regulating intercellular traffic of the membrane transport proteins. They have similarly found that a member of this protein family has become specialized as a transporter of amino acids. Dr. André’s lab  is our partner for using bacteriocins in 
Dr. Wattiez is an expert on proteomics. His group studies the role of polypeptides to understand the cellular mechanisms of bacteria in a uni- or multicellular context. They use state-of-the-art technology, such as high-resolution mass spectrometry, to understand the functional aspects of the cell in its entirety. Dr Wattiez’s lab allows us to use

History – Syngulon – Bacteriocin-based technologies
CEO interview at BIO World Congress
Bacteriocins are small, ribosomally-produced peptides with antimicrobial properties. They are typically described as having a very narrow specificity, often targeting similarly related bacterial species or strains. Some bacteriocins have a wide spectrum of activity, as we have observed in concurrence with the literature. These molecules have great potential for industrial applications.
The video below illustrates how bacteriocins can affect bacterial growth. The top video shows normal growth of 
 (two hours of growth in LB medium followed by eight hours in a solution WITHOUT bacteriocins). The bottom video shows 
 grown in the same conditions, but in a solution WITH bacteriocins. (time-lapsed microscopy combined with microfluidic device of the Cellular and Molecular Microbiology lab at ULB)
The history of bacteriocins begins with the 
. In 1925, as an early result of a search for bacteria with antimicrobial properties, Gratia described the activity of colicin, the first known bacteriocin. This discovery happened concurrently with Alexander Fleming’s description of the antibiotic penicillin in 1928 and the independent observations of bacteriophage activity by Frederick Twort in 1915 and Félix d’Hérelle in 1917.
Bacteriocins did not receive the same level of attention as antibiotics, as a lack of understanding of their biology led to difficulties in their production and low consistency in controlling microbial growth. This led to the dominance of chemically synthesized broad-spectrum antibiotics for the rest of the 20th century up to the present. Similar issues were observed with bacteriophages, although they have found extensive medical use in the country of Georgia through the work of d’Hérélle and George Eliava, as well as in Russia and Poland The use of bacteriophages in the dairy industry has also been commercialized in the US and the Netherlands.
Currently, bacteriocin use is most often associated with the food industry. Many bacteriocins are produced by Gram-positive species, particularly lactic acid producing bacteria such as Lactoccocus sp. Nisin is the most widely used of these bacteriocins, acting as a food preservative, and has 
GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status from the FDA
 has great negative implications for human health. The reduction of antibiotic use in medical and industrial applications should be a common goal to reduce the amount of antibiotics released into the environment. Bacteriocins offer a promising approach to solving this problem. Additionally, avoiding the use of antibiotics in industrial applications of biofermentors can reduce production costs and help focus metabolic output on production.
Bacteriocins are also known to play a role in bacterial communication and ecology. For example, the gut and oral cavity are parts of the human body that accommodate thousands of different bacterial species. These bacteria, often beneficial for human health, are continuously in a stressful environment and compete for food and space. When he was researcher in Prof. Pascal Hols lab (UCL/LIBST), Dr. Johann Mignolet (now R&D Project Manager of Syngulon) demonstrated that 
, a commensal human gut bacterium, uses a communication pheromone to concomitantly trigger two responses: the ability to modify its genome via the acquisition of “foreign” DNA and the production of potent bacteriocins. These toxins or non-transformable variants of 
 could be used for medical purposes to kill harmful multi-resistant superbugs such as 
 and several streptococci (Mignolet et al 2018; PMID: 29444418; DOI:

Synthetic biology – Syngulon – Bacteriocin-based technologies
CEO interview at BIO World Congress
Bacteriocins are small, genetically encoded peptides used by bacteria to target and kill other microbes, which can be closely or distantly related, with a specific or broad spectrum of action. As a result, they are amenable to manipulation through genetic engineering techniques.
 involves the application of engineering techniques to biological systems. Engineering within a biological system is similar to traditional engineering in that both begin with a collection of tools, parts, and a basic “chassis”. The biological system differs from traditional engineering systems in that while both can be constructed by the addition of modules or parts to the basic chassis, the 
biological chassis is the organismal genome, including both chromosomal and extra-chromosomal (episomal) elements, and is thereforebased on evolution
. This simplifies the process of replicating the system but has the downside of the possible introduction of errors. Biological system “parts” consist of separable genetic elements that can be characterized by function and activity level and recombined into new systems. DNA cloning, sequencing, editing, and synthesis technologies underly this approach. 
 modelling is an important tool for understanding the interplay of synthetic networks constructed from these biological parts, especially in the context of a living cell. An example of this approach would be the 
 parts registry, a collection of genetic parts designed to be easily constructed into new genetic systems.
The name Syngulon invokes our mission: to use synthetic biology to improve, protect, and contain microbial systems used in industrial processes. We use bacteriocins to improve biofermentation by removing the need for antibiotic-based selection and preventing contamination from unwanted microbes. Bacteriocins can target other microbes down to the strain level. Similarly, bacteriocins already existing in nature can be manipulated to expand their specificity. Synthetic biology also gives us the potential to create 
 using synthetic biology techniques. We apply synthetic biology techniques to produce bacteriocins by using state of the art tools for sequence design and DNA and peptide synthesis as well as high-throughput screening for desired effects. We can produce bacteriocins through

Bacteriocins vs Antibiotics and Bacteriophages – Syngulon – Bacteriocin-based technologies
CEO interview at BIO World Congress
Bacteriocins, together with antibiotics and bacteriophages, make up a spectrum of antimicrobial compounds. Antibiotics are by far the most well-known and widely distributed agents used to control and limit microbial growth. Although bacteriocins and bacteriophages were described concurrently with antibiotics, the latter was the most quickly and widely adopted in the West due to 1) ease of production, and 2) their generally wide activity spectrum. However, the widespread use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which threatens human health. Additionally, microbiome studies are revealing the therapeutic and commensal nature of many of the microbes living in and on humans, demonstrating that 
beneficial microbes are removed through broad-spectrum antibiotic use
. The use of antibiotics in industrial applications can also be prohibitively expensive.
Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that infect bacteria. Like bacteriocins, they were not widely adopted throughout the world during the 20th century.  Rather, phage use has been selective, with most health-related research being done in Russia and the country of Georgia, while phage use in the food industry has begun to be implemented in the dairy industry in the US and the Netherlands.
Indeed, phages offer advantages to antibiotics in terms of their specificity, as they can target individual species. However, there are drawbacks to phage use, particularly in terms of unwanted phage integration into the bacterial genome, a state called lysogeny, which can make controlling phage reproduction difficult. Additionally, phages themselves are self-replicating entities, which can add another layer of uncertainty to their use.
Bacteriocins are ribosomally-synthesized peptides secreted by bacteria that are capable of targeting either a wide or narrow spectrum of bacteria. Their small size limits the metabolic strain on the host, and they are found in hundreds of known species. Their mechanism of action can be specific or broad, making the development of resistance a less likely occurrence. Additionally, bacteriocins are needed in much smaller quantities to kill bacteria than antibiotics. These qualities make bacteriocins an attractive alternative to antibiotics in the context of AMR (Antimicrobial resistance).
