Naturally Tasty Cat & Dog Food | Edgard & Cooper
We believe all pets deserve the best. That's why when it comes to feeding them, only real food will do.
Our new cat range is on the prowl. With no sugar, no grains and only the yummiest, freshest cuts of meat it's real food with catitude. Sniff, lick, paw, passes the test.
Eating is one of life’s simple joys, but so many pet foods overcomplicate their products. We do things differently. By treating nature’s ingredients with respect, we make food that’s naturally healthy, full of flavour and perfect for every pet.
To make our kibble, we use as much fresh meat as possible – that means nothing has been overprocessed or dried. And absolutely no meat or fish meal.
Often made with a mix of unclear ingredients (meat but also bones, skin, hooves...)
The smell and taste of fresh meat is utterly irresistible, so there’ll be no leftovers.
Our recipes are full of nutritious goodies, including natural nutrients and antioxidants for all-round good health.
Fresh meat is a pet’s natural food, which means they find it easy to digest.
We have always believed in the superpowers of healthy fruit and fresh veg. So in our quest to bring you and your dog even more choice, we’ve created our first ever plant-based recipes.
In our opinion they are so veggie good, they contain everything your dog needs to thrive and be at their veggie best every single day!
In addition to our more sustainable¹ packaging, we're stepping up to do more for the planet. Meet our Zero Pawprint Plan, our strategy that is better for our planet by 2025.

Naturally Tasty Cat & Dog Food | Edgard & Cooper
We believe all pets deserve the best. That's why when it comes to feeding them, only real food will do.
Our new cat range is on the prowl. With no sugar, no grains and only the yummiest, freshest cuts of meat it's real food with catitude. Sniff, lick, paw, passes the test.
Eating is one of life’s simple joys, but so many pet foods overcomplicate their products. We do things differently. By treating nature’s ingredients with respect, we make food that’s naturally healthy, full of flavour and perfect for every pet.
To make our kibble, we use as much fresh meat as possible – that means nothing has been overprocessed or dried. And absolutely no meat or fish meal.
Often made with a mix of unclear ingredients (meat but also bones, skin, hooves...)
The smell and taste of fresh meat is utterly irresistible, so there’ll be no leftovers.
Our recipes are full of nutritious goodies, including natural nutrients and antioxidants for all-round good health.
Fresh meat is a pet’s natural food, which means they find it easy to digest.
We have always believed in the superpowers of healthy fruit and fresh veg. So in our quest to bring you and your dog even more choice, we’ve created our first ever plant-based recipes.
In our opinion they are so veggie good, they contain everything your dog needs to thrive and be at their veggie best every single day!
In addition to our more sustainable¹ packaging, we're stepping up to do more for the planet. Meet our Zero Pawprint Plan, our strategy that is better for our planet by 2025.
