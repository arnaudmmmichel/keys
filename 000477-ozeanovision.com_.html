How did I go without these?!?
Genuinely fantastic sunglasses. They fit my head really well and the sun protection is great. Would (and have!) highly recommend to others!
I'm never buying sunglasses from a chemist again. Yes cheap but they rip off the environment.  My Ozeano sunnies look way better, have better frames and lenses and I can adjust them to suit my noggin.  And very importantly for me they stop the demand for plastics (being non plastic) and recycle my old ones plus offer a discount for returning them.  An excellent example of how a circular economy can work - good for the planet, people and a new economy.
 Coolum (Leopard Seal) - Polarised Sunglasses 
This is my second pair of Ozeano Sunglasses. First, Freshie Bullfish sunnies were unfortunately misplaced, or, on their way to their next owner? Depends how you view things...?
I'm impressed w the Coolum sunnies. I prefer the Sunglass legs on this set and they fit better.
Massive supporter of the morals and ethos of Ozeano generally and really wish 'you' all the best in continuing in this space.
Good work to the whole 'team'!
 Coolum (Leopard Seal) - Polarised Sunglasses 
I often look for B-Corp when purchasing products and so glad I found Ozeano. I purchased prescription sunglasses and glasses from these guys and loved both products, they look great and fit great (adjustable sizing tips they send you works a treat)
Great quality and looks cool. Would consider buying more.
I really enjoy wearing these sunglasses. They look and feel great. The frame fits perfectly, the lens are not too dark allowing great viewing at work, driving and hiking. They are well made, vegan, ethical, biodegradable and made in Australia. I highly recommend these sunglasses. Furthermore they arrived the day after I ordered them.
Since the moment that I found your product it was love at first sight, plant based, compostable materials, the rubbish collected from the ocean program, the sunnys designs and names, your website suitable to try them on, just perfect!! 
The delivery was super quick and once I have them on my hands OMG, quality, stylish top top. 
I used your guide to adjust them as well... 
I love my new sunnies with Ozeano, really light,nice design and you’re doing something good for the earth
Very happy with these sunnies, noticed the quality as soon as I got them out of the box, and they fit better than a lot of sunnies I've owned. Also appreciate the low waste packaging!
These glasses are awesome - the lens’s are amazingly clear and the frames comfortable.
My new sunglasses are lovely, the colour of the frames is just right, and they look very good. Its good to know there is an environmental aspect to the purchase.

Top 5 benefits of polarised sunglasses lenses
One of our most popular products is our polarised sunglasses. Read the top 5 benefits of polarised lenses.
 With the problem our planet is facing, it’s clear that our actions have an impact on the environment. Fast fashion is quickly becoming a thing of the past and we all need to put more consideration into what we buy. With that in mind, if you are looking to buy new   sunglasses online  , then choosing eco-friendly frames is the obvious choice. Our   Australian sunglasses 
  was conceived through a desire to encourage people to get out and see the beauty of our world through lenses that play a part in helping to ensure it stays beautiful.  
 Stylish design doesn’t have to mean fast fashion. Our unisex frames suit any style and come in a variety of marine-themed designs and colours. We take inspiration for our designs from mother nature, particularly from the shores of Australia where our   sustainable sunglasses   are designed.  
 Plastic waste continues to litter our oceans and waterways. Standard plastic frames take up to 450 years to breakdown and decompose. In doing our bit to combat this and help save vulnerable marine life, every sale of our sunglasses contributes to 6kg of ocean litter being collected through the Australian Seabin Project. In addition to that, all 
  used to make our   sustainable sunglasses   are responsibly sourced and our frames are made from the ground-breaking plant-based ‘M49 Bio-Acetate’. This material is 100% organic, renewable, recyclable and completely biodegradable. Feel like switching up your sunnies? As part of our circular economy scheme, you can get 25% off your next purchase upon return of your used pair.  
 We’re also conscious of the impact that carbon emissions have on the environment. Our commitment to sustainability means that when you buy our   sunglasses online   from anywhere in the world, they are delivered to you through carbon-neutral means. This initiative supports the reduction of carbon emissions while also reducing your carbon footprint. All of our packaging is also 100% biodegradable. 
 We understand the importance of buying something that will last the course. Our   sustainable sunglasses   are made with the highest quality materials. The high-performance 
  used in our sunglasses will keep your eyes protected from glare and are also scratch-resistant and block harmful UVA and UVB rays. Our 
  are skillfully designed by our expert artisans and are sturdy enough for you to explore the great outdoors with confidence. 
 As well as being eco-friendly, our sustainable sunglasses are ethically made and Peta-approved vegan, meaning no animals were harmed in the manufacturing process. We also believe in giving back and with every purchase you make, you help fund the treatment to restore the vision of someone in need. 
 Everybody should believe in something, and we believe you should enjoy the beauty of our planet through shades that you can feel good about wearing. Browse through our   sustainable sunglasses   collection, and when you buy a pair online through our website, you’re guaranteed free shipping regardless of your location.

As all of our frames are made from natural, plant-based materials, they can be easily manipulated to create the perfect fit for your individual head size and face shape — all you need is a standard hairdryer. 
To use a hairdryer, you’ll need to have it on the 
, so the air flow isn’t at its highest, but is blowing hot air (not cool).
Each frame front has a curve so they wrap around the front of your face. As every head shape and size is slightly different, you might want to either increase or decrease the curve to tighten or loosen the width of the frames. 
To increase or decrease the width, point the hairdryer directly at the nose bridge of the temple (the bit that goes above your nose, highlighted in the photo) for 15 - 20 seconds, then gently apply pressure by pulling the left and right sides of the frame front inwards (towards the nose bridge) to reduce width, or outwards (away from the nose bridge) to increase width, and hold it in place for 30 seconds.
 You can repeat this process until you’re happy with the perfect fit. 
The sunglasses should fit comfortably on your face, feeling snug on either side, but not too tight that it's uncomfortable.
Each temple has an arch that should fit comfortably on your ear and ensure the frames are secure and don't slip forwards. 
To increase or decrease the arch, point a hairdryer directly at the arch of the temple (the bendy bit that goes over your ear, highlighted in the photo) for 15 - 20 seconds, then gently apply pressure to either increase or decrease the arch slightly and hold it in place for 30 seconds. You can repeat this process until you’re happy with the arch on both temples. 
The sunglasses should fit comfortably on your face and not slip forward. If you're bending over at a 90 degree angle, they will likely slip forward, but shouldn't fall off. 
If you have any issues at all with adjusting the fit, 
 and we'll be more than happy to help. 
Alternatively, you can also take your sunglasses in to your local optometrist and ask them to adjust the fit for you using their hot air machines (fancy hairdryers). 
Unrivalled in quality and sustainability, we don't do fast fashion, we do handmade, built-to-last environmentally friendly products that stand the test of time and don't cost the earth.

Ozeano’s collection of sustainable prescription glasses offers a variety of marine-themed designs and colours like the spotted leopard seal, shiny black orca, striking rosy-red snapper and translucent jellyfish. Unisex and incredibly versatile, our frames are intended to suit anyone and everyone. And with clean lines designed to follow the natural contours of your face, you can expect an ultra-flattering, comfortable fit every time. 
Did you know standard plastic frames take up to 450 years to break down and decompose? Our eco-friendly prescription glasses can 100% biodegrade in 110 days under compost conditions, but will last a lifetime otherwise. We’re a certified carbon-neutral company, and through our partnership with the Australian Seabin Project, we are also able to do our bit and help protect vulnerable marine life. Bettering our beaches and oceans is at the heart of what we do, and so every sale of our glasses contributes to the collection of 12kg of ocean litter, equivalent to over 1000 plastic bottles. 
Ready for a new pair? As part of our 
, you can get 25% off your next purchase simply by returning your used pair. Because all of our glasses are 100% recyclable, when you send us back your old pair, we’ll make sure no part of it goes to waste. 
Our commitment to sustainability means that when you buy our eco friendly glasses online from anywhere in the world, we’ll provide you with free shipping via a carbon-neutral courier provider. Environmentally conscious from start to finish, our packaging is 100% biodegradable — even the tape securing your package is compostable! Shop our sustainable 
 to experience the difference and feel proud of your eyewear.

Why do you need blue light glasses?
In the modern world, feeling dry and tired eyes after a long day of staring at a computer screen is a common complaint. That’s because digital screens emit blue light, which can have a negative impact and cause issues such as strained, dry, watery or irritated eyes. Blue light is also linked to issues with sleep schedule, due to it causing complications with circadian rhythm, which is the internal clock that manages when it’s time to sleep or be awake.
With more and more businesses becoming digital, and a massive shift towards working from home, it’s hard to avoid blue light emitting screens. Also, with most people now using personal smartphones or tablets in their everyday life, it’s important to be aware of the potential damage blue light can cause, and have adequate blue light protection when using digital screens.
That’s where our handmade Australian blue light blocking glasses come in. Blue light filter 
 are designed to filter out the high-energy blue light frequencies from the visible light spectrum, which is important as blue-light is some of the highest energy wavelengths of visible light (400-440 nm), which is why overexposure can lead to eye complaints. By wearing blue light glasses, protection is given to the amount of blue light that hits the eye and reaches the retina, leaving the blue light glasses wearers eyes feeling more relaxed.
The market-leading blue light blocking lenses we use don’t impact colour temperature perceptibility, which is important for anyone who needs to maintain attention to detail in their field of work, such as graphic designers. The blue light blocking lenses also feature anti-scratch and anti-reflective coatings, and have a superhydrophobic finishing that will repel liquid and makes the lens extremely resistant to any water, sweat, oil, grease, dirt or dust.
Other tips for avoiding sore eyes
Blue light blocking lenses don’t guarantee to solve issues you may be experiencing, so it’s not a given that you will definitely have improved sleep, or any eye complaints you have will just disappear. That’s because there could be a number of other reasons behind your specific issue, so it’s always a good idea to incorporate other measures into your routine to try and help protect your eyes. 
A good habit to adopt is the 20/20/20 rule, whereby every 20 minutes you should look at an object 20 meter into the distance, for at least 20 seconds. This will force you to relieve the strain on your eyes, and give your eye muscles a much-needed break. Other sensible measures include reducing your screen brightness so it’s not so intense, keeping yourself hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, and using lubricating eye drops throughout the day to stop your eyes from drying out. You might also want to avoid using digital screes before bed so you’re not having that blue light hit your eyes in the evenings, so set yourself a time each evening where you stop using any digital screens and see if that has a positive impact on your sleep quality.

Ozeano is driven by a desire to make a difference, with at least 5% of revenue donated each year. Our very existence centres around our ability to help protect nature's future, with a core principle of our business being to 
. That means we should never settle, and always be of the mindset that we have to do more to protect people and our planet.
Here's a few things we're already doing to make a difference.
6kg of ocean litter collected with every sale
The original motivation behind forming Ozeano was triggered by realising the enormity of the ocean pollution problem our planet is facing. To help make a difference, with every purchase you make, you fund the removal of 6kg of plastic & marine litter from our oceans and waterways, equivalent to over 500 plastic bottles. 
By choosing to wear Ozeano, you're part of the solution, not the problem. 
What's the problem with ocean litter?
Today, an entire rubbish truck load of plastic ends up in the ocean every single minute, equating to a staggering 8 million tonnes over the course of a year. It’s estimated that there is now 18,000 pieces of plastic floating in every square kilometre of ocean, which is causing real harm to marine mammals and our ecosystem. 
Over 200 different marine species have been found to ingest plastic, causing the death of over 300,000 marine mammals and over 400,000 sea birds every single year. 
f things continue at this rate, it’s estimated that the amount of plastic entering our oceans could have doubled by 2025, with studies suggesting our oceans will contain more plastic than fish by 2050. 
We’re proud to partner with Australian company Seabin Project, who are responsible for the creation of the ‘Sea bin’, a revolution in ocean clean­ing technology that creates cleaner oceans with healthier marine life.
We donate $6 from each purchase of Ozeano sunglasses (excluding wholesale) to fund the operation of 1 Seabin to remove 6kg of plastic & marine litter from our oceans & waterways. 
Ozeano is proud to be a certified B Corporation. Certified B Corporations, or B-Corps, are social enterprises verified by B Lab, a nonprofit organisation. Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Lab performed a very comprehensive and holistic assessment of our organisation, with the certification officially awarded to us in Q3 2021. 
Whilst we use only the most environmentally-friendly materials available and employ ethical and sustainable production practices, we still generate some carbon emissions (CO2) when producing our products. To tackle these unavoidable emissions, we invest in offset projects such as renewable energy, forest conservation and energy efficiency. These projects prevent future carbon emissions as well as removing existing CO2 from the atmosphere.
We buy carbon offset credits from Gold Standard certified projects that are equal to our unavoidable emissions. This provides crucial funding for these projects to continue to thrive, while making all of our products and accessories carbon neutral from ‘seed to shelf’.  When you make a purchase, you will receive a certificate in your name for the carbon credits that were purchased to offset the emissions for your product. 
What's the problem with carbon emissions?
There are both natural and human sources of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). Natural sources are an important part of a self-sustaining and functioning ecosystem and come from living things like animals and plants that release CO2 when they respire (i.e. breathing in oxygen and exhaling CO2). Human sources are the problem and come primarily from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, as well as mass deforestation. 
Human sources of carbon dioxide emissions have upset the natural balance that existed for many thousands of years before the influence of humans, because natural carbon sinks (such as the ocean, soil and plants) remove around the same quantity of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as is produced by natural sources. This natural process had kept carbon dioxide levels balanced and in a safe range, but human sources of emissions have upset the natural balance by adding extra carbon dioxide to the atmosphere without removing the same amount. 
Given carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat from the sun to warm our oceans and atmosphere; it plays a critical role in enabling life on this planet, keeping Earth at a liveable global temperature. The issue is that human-induced changes in the concentrations of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere — driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels to produce electricity, or to heat and cool buildings, or to power machines  — is changing the amount of heat that is trapped, causing dangerous global warming and climate change.
Global warming and climate change is dangerous in that it threatens the livelihood of our planet, animals, humans, and ultimately, life as we know it. Symptoms include melting of the polar ice caps, the rising of sea levels, the disturbance of animals’ natural habitats, animal extinction, extreme weather events, water and food shortages, and other negative side effects that are dangerous to the planet, to human and animal life, and to our future.
The planet's average surface temperature has already risen about 1.14°C since the late 19th century and most of the warming has occurred in the past 40 years, with six of the warmest years on record taking place since 2014. In order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released 
 stating we must reduce carbon emissions to the point where we hold global warming to no more than an additional 1.5 °C. 
As humans, every aspect of our life is reliant on the natural environment. This includes the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we drink, the clothes we wear and the products that are made and sold to create jobs and drive the economy. A healthy and stable climate is our most precious natural resource, and so as a global community, we must take our carbon footprint extremely seriously if we are to have a chance of achieving the 1.5 °C target. 
Carbon offsetting is a way to cancel out unavoidable carbon emissions, by investing in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
At Ozeano, we worked with Green Story to undertake rigorous life cycle analysis of our entire supply chains in order to calculate the CO2 emissions generated by our products and accessories, so we know how much we need to offset in order to be carbon-neutral.
Our approach for carbon neutrality is to offset our carbon footprint with a mix of Reforestation, Renewable Energy and Community projects. We have handpicked high-quality projects based on their type, location, and benefits. Each project supports multiple UN sustainable development goals in addition to offsetting CO2, and all our projects are rigorously verified and certified through 
; the world-leading independent verifiers who ensure projects are working to deliver the benefits they promise.
Mount Sandy project is nestled between the Coorong National Park and Lake Albert in South Australia and protects one of the last pockets of bush and wetlands in the region. The site features a unique mix of coastal shrublands and saline swamplands that provide strategic habitat for iconic native wildlife, such as the short-beaked echidna, purple-gaped honeyeater and elegant parrot.
The purpose of Karadere Wind Power Project is to utilize the wind energy potential of Turkey by reducing dependence on fossil fuels in a clean, reliable and sustainable way with utmost respect on social and environmental aspects in the region.
Hydrologic, an award winning Cambodian social enterprise, is providing access to clean, safe drinking water to more than 1 million Cambodian families by locally produced ceramic water purifiers, protecting the environment and reducing emissions by providing a safe alternative to fire or gas boiling methods for water treatment. 
We hold a gold-standard membership with 1% for the Planet organisation, meaning we donate 1% of our total annual sales (whole company) to them to support their environmental initiatives.
1% for the Planet is a network of like-minded individuals, businesses, donors and nonprofit organisations working together toward a common goal: protecting the future of our planet. To date, members have collectively given back more than $253 million to the environment. 
Once you become part of the Ozeano family, you also become part of our circular economy scheme, meaning you get 
All Ozeano eyewear is made from an innovative plant-based material, meaning it's 100% recyclable, so if you send us your old pair of sunglasses we can recycle or repurpose them, ensuring our products never go to waste. 
All shipping of Ozeano products is carbon-neutral, via either Sendle or Australia Post. 
Sendle partner with South Pole Group to offset the emissions of every parcel that is picked up and delivered, supporting emissions reduction projects here in Australia and across the world. Australia Post purchase carbon offset credits, mostly in Australia, to match the calculated emissions for the deliveries provided. 
As well as regularly visiting our suppliers and ensuring a fair living wage is paid to all workers, we have several certifications:
 (Forest Stewardship Council) is a global not-for-profit organisation that sets the standards for what a responsibly managed forest is, both environmentally and socially. All our cork cases are made from FSC-certified cork oak forests. 
 (Global Organic Textile Standard) is a certification that ensures the organic status of textiles, including environmentally and socially responsible practises across the full supply chain. All our organic pouches and cloths are GOTS-certified. 
 (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is a global not-for-profit association dedicated to establishing and protecting the rights of all animals. All of our products are PETA-approved vegan, meaning no animals are harmed. 
 (International Organisation for Standardisation) is an international standard-setting organisation. All our suppliers are ISO 9001 certified, ensuring they meet customer and regulatory requirements. Our frame material is also ISO 14855, which certifies its ultimate biodegradability within 115 days under controlled composting conditions.

Our unwavering commitment is to provide the highest quality eyewear, with the lowest environmental impact. From the materials we source, to the techniques and machinery we use, everything is carefully selected to be sustainable, ethical, and of the highest quality. 
Designed on the sandy shores of Sydney, Australia
Every frame is designed in-house at Ozeano HQ on the shores of Sydney, Australia. Our designers draw inspiration from the natural beauty of our planet, with a focus on quality construction, classic shapes and timeless styles. Every design is carefully considered to stand the test of time, in terms of both quality, and style. 
The hand-drawn sketches are digitized through a process called computer-aided design (CAD). Our team iterates on the design to create 3D representations and technical diagrams, including frame design details such as dimensions, tolerances and curvatures. 
Prototypes are created by hand to provide a physical representation of the frame design, in a variety of different colours and combinations. A meticulous process of testing prototypes with customers, making tweaks based on feedback, and re-running prototypes continues until we're completely happy with the structure and style.
All frames are ethically handmade by Ozeano's artisans in our ISO9001, ISO14001 and SA8000-certified facility, leveraging a mixture of long-established artisanal techniques and cutting-edge technology to cut and sculpt sheets of material to form frame fronts and temples. Precision adjustments are applied to ensure the perfect fit for every frame style and head shape. 
Frame fronts are polished in a woodchip tumbling machine for several days to create a smooth texture to the frames and remove any excess material. Each frame is then filed down and carefully buffed by hand to ensure a perfectly smooth and polished finish. 
All Ozeano frames come with market-leading lenses. At this stage our polarised lenses have the anti-scratch coating applied and are steam cleaned, before being securely fitted to the frame fronts. 
Every finished frame is put through a series of rigorous quality assurance tests and processes to ensure the product meets our high standards in every aspect. From testing durability and robustness of construction, to comparing every curve and dimension to the CAD model and prototype, everything is checked and signed off multiple times before we package up the frame ready for its new owner.

Whenever you buy products, it's important to know what materials they're made from, and where the materials come from. 
Today, many businesses cover up unsustainable and unethical practices by hiding supply chain information from their customers. 
At Ozeano Vision, we have gone to great lengths to source the most sustainable and ethically produced materials from across the world.
All Ozeano frames are handmade using innovative ‘M49 Bio-Acetate’ material that’s manufactured ethically in Italy (under the European Union’s strict 
) by prestigious family-owned Italien company, Mazzucchelli 1849. Bio-Acetate is a totally natural, renewable, and 100% recyclable material made without the use of any of the harmful fossil fuels, oils, BPA or chemical plasticisers found in conventional acetate or plastic, replacing harmful Diethyl Phthalate—derived from petroleum—with an organic plant-based alternative. Made from responsibly-harvested cotton and wood pulp fibres with organic pigments and dyes, this eco-friendly Bio-Acetate is much better for our ecosystem and the environment. Besides being made from renewable resources, M49 Bio-Acetate is 100% biodegradable within 115 days, as per the Internationally recognised standard ISO 14855.
metal double hinge with teflon-coated screws
For any eyewear, the hinges and screws that are used to secure the temples to the frame are incredibly important for the durability and structure of the product. 
We want all our eyewear products to last a lifetime, that's why we use a top-of-the-range, robust, Italian-made double wire core hinge, complete with Teflon-coated screws to create a hinging system that won't loosen over time, show signs of rusting or discolouration, or break under heavy impact. 
UV rays can be just as harmful to the eyes as they are to the skin. For that reason, all Ozeano eyewear comes complete with market-leading polarised lenses. Our premium lenses contain a special polarisation filter that blocks intense reflective lights and reduces glare, which enhances visual clarity, and increases contrast, definition and colour perception. 
Our lenses also contain a special anti-scratch coating. The lenses are made 'anti-scratch' by coating them with a hard protective layer. The coating is applied to the front and back of the lenses to ensure full protection, meaning they're less prone to ugly scratches or visible marks, making them as durable as possible in order to prolong their lifespan.  The lenses are category 3 and offer
 100% protection against UVA and UVB radiation (aka certified UV400) and meet t
he Australian requirements of AS/NZS1067:2016 and European EN ISO 12312-1:2013+A1:2015 standards for sunglasses.
Organic cotton crop is made from natural seeds (as opposed to genetically modified seeds used in regular cotton farming) and does not use any harmful chemicals like synthetic fertilisers or pesticides. As a result, it doesn't poison the water, soil or air and workers on organic cotton farms are spared from the health problems caused by chemicals in regular cotton farming. Organic cotton farming also uses 88% less water and 62% less energy and as it eliminates the use of pesticides and fertilisers, it prevents contamination of groundwater, thus making drinking water clean and safe. It has been found that the impact of water pollution of organic cotton is 98% less compared to conventional cotton production. 
 stands for 'Global Organic Textile Standard' and is certification to ensure the organic status of textiles from harvesting of the raw materials through environmentally and socially responsible manufacturing, all the way to labelling in order to provide credible assurance to consumers.
The FSC-certified cork material used for all Ozeano cases has a beautiful natural look and soft feel that's hand-crafted into a waterproof, easy to clean case that provides just the right level of protection for your eyewear. We use cork for its sustainable properties, being a 100 percent natural, biodegradable, recyclable and renewable resource. The cork tree is not cut down to obtain cork; when the tree reaches full maturity, layers of the tree bark are stripped off (without harming the tree) to harvest the cork and turn it in to our protective cases. The harvesting of cork bark also has another major positive impact on our environment, as harvested cork trees absorb 3-5 times more CO2 – a greenhouse gas that causes climate change – than non-harvested trees. 
 stands for 'Forest Stewardship Council', which is a global not-for-profit organisation that sets the standards for what a responsibly managed forest is, both environmentally and socially. All our cork cases come from FSC-certified cork oak forests, which ensures they're healthy, sustainable and benefit local communities as well as providing jobs for local workers.
Our product hang tags and certificates are made from FSC-certified natural Kraft paper and printed with waterless vegetable-based ink. Kraft paper is made from unbleached natural kraft fibres, can be entirely recycled multiple times, and is 100% biodegradable. To ensure we're giving back to nature, our Australian family-run supplier plants a tree for every order we place with them.
Ozeano hang tags are tied using a hemp cord. Hemp is reusable, entirely recyclable, 100% biodegradable and doesn't require the use of any pesticides or herbicides to grow like many other plants. Hemp also helps reduce global warming impact, as it takes out large amounts of carbon dioxide per acre, more than most other plants, so growing hemp is actually carbon-negative. 
All our shipping boxes are made from natural kraft board from our Melbourne-based supplier. Natural kraft is a biomaterial meaning it's produced from all-natural ingredients such as pulp from different types of wood. Our kraft paper is unbleached so there's no intense chemical treatment involved, and we print on the board using UV ink – an eco-friendly alternative that doesn’t contain the carbon-based chemicals found in other inks. Using UV ink also eliminates the need for heat during the printing process, creating a safer workplace for employees. Kraft paper is a mono-material that is easily recycled multiple-times, and 100% biodegrades naturally within a few weeks, decomposing just like leaves that fall off a tree.
All Ozeano products are shipped in home compostable courier bags with 100% biodegradable tape. Our courier bags are made from plants, corn starch to be exact, and they are certified AS 5810-2010 for Home Composting, meaning they can be put in a home compost and will break down and biodegrade within 3-6 months in a compost environment, removing the need for any toxic processes. So, when you’re finished using the bag, simply put it in with your food scraps and garden waste and the worms will have a great time feeding on it. 
These strong and waterproof bags are also easily reusable, so why not reuse the bag before composting it. 
As well as regularly visiting our suppliers and ensuring a fair living wage is paid to all workers, we have several certifications:
 (Forest Stewardship Council) is a global not-for-profit organisation that sets the standards for what a responsibly managed forest is, both environmentally and socially. All our cases are made from cork sourced from
