Small Batch Gelato - Created in Bayside
Our batches of house-made gelato are small because we believe in creating the freshest, smoothest gelato with the best and brightest flavours.  We don’t use off-the-shelf mixes, preservatives, artificial colours or flavours.  Plus we use seasonal ingredients because it’s more fun for you and better for the planet.  Hooray!    
“So, what’s the difference between gelato and ice-cream?” you might be wondering.  Gelato is made using more whole milk (or, no milk at all depending on the flavour) and less sugar than ice-cream, and ice-cream often uses more cream than gelato.  Ice-cream also has a lot more air churned through it than gelato has.  This means that gelato has a more intense flavour than ice-cream, and because gelato is served at a lower temperature it feels smoother in the mouth.  Mmmmmm  . . . . delicious.
When you visit us in store you can sometimes see our Italian trained gelato chef hard at work in our custom built kitchen creating the flavours for the day.
House-made daily using Victorian milk from Schultz Organic Dairy and Gippsland Jersey, our smooth gelato is available in Vanilla, Salted Caramel and Chocolate, plus other delicious flavours like Iced Coffee, Cookies & Cream, Hazelnut and Pistachio, depending on the week.  Check out our 
 to see what’s in-store right now.  
Called sorbetto, it’s light and refreshing and bursts with the flavours and colours of seasonal fruits.   We always try to source locally grown Victorian produce wherever possible and will never use fruits flown in from overseas.
Our sorbeto is dairy free and vegan.
100% plant based, our vegan gelato contains no milk, cream or eggs.  Using oat, coconut, cashew or almond milk the result is a creamy gelato with flavours you’ll be smitten with.
Little Sky’s range of kosher pre-packed tubs contain Kosher Australia fully certified gelato. Available in non-dairy (Pareve) and dairy gelato in a range of delicious flavours including Chocolate, Vanilla, Hazelnut, Strawberry and Lemon.  Special, limited edition flavours are also available from time to time including Rosh Hashanah flavours, Honey, and, Apple Crumble. Kosher gelato is also available for Little Sky gelato cart events and wholesale. 
If you’ve already had a chance to visit us you will have seen Little Sky is a little different to most ice-cream/gelato shops.  Big glass display cabinets heaped with ice-cream are nowhere to be seen.  Our gelato is kept in lidded stainless steel containers in a cabinet (called a pozzetti).  The pozzetti protects the gelato from the air and helps keep it at a consistent temperature and deliciously fresh.  Which is absolutely perfect for our small batch, house-made gelato.

Did somebody say house-made waffle Cones? 
Yes.  It’s true.  Little Sky waffle cones are beyond delicious.
We make them in-store from scratch in small batches and thought as they are so amazing the cones should generate their own magic powers.  So now they do.  For every waffle cone we sell, we donate 10c to the Royal Children’s Hospital to help in our own little way as we think the things that the RCH do is pretty close to magic.
Our scoops are served on all natural cones from The Original Cone Co made down the road in Somerton as part of our standard offer.  Their cone recipe is free from any preservatives or artificial colours.  A gluten free option is also available.
