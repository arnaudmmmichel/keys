Our approach is commercial and strategic, giving you advice to put you in the driver’s seat, but we are not averse to directing you away from legal dealings when it’s not in your best interests, commercially or otherwise. We prefer to see you spending your time and money on your business rather than on lawyers, unless you really need to.
We are your trusted partner in business and will ensure you are serviced by a specialist advisory team as and when required. We actively manage these relationships and will always keep you in the loop so you enjoy seamless advice, tailored to fit you and your business.
We have invested in cloud based technology to keep our systems as efficient and flexible as possible, so you don’t have to pay for anything but the legal services and expertise we provide. We make your interactions with us as easy and convenient, to ensure you don’t have to take hours out of your business to meet with us. You aren’t charged anything extra for calling us or for checking in.
Our expertise is in the commercial and corporate advisory areas of law, however our clients enjoy a full legal advisory experience with us as we collaborate with industry experts and leaders. This ensures our clients have the best person giving the right advice at the right time. If we don’t practice in the area you need, we will introduce you to our trusted network of legal and other advisers who will look after you just as we would. We will always actively manage these relationships to ensure you enjoy seamless service in all complementary areas of law and other professional services.
We believe in open and honest collaboration and working with the best people to ensure legal and other intricate issues faced by our clients are dealt with in the most effective and efficient way possible. We don’t pretend to know what we don’t know.
We stick to what we’re good at to make sure you get the best possible value and outcomes and we’ll introduce you to the smartest people we know to help you with the rest.

The value we have to offer cannot be measured by time. We’d rather spend our time working with you to get the best possible outcomes, not watching the clock. As Einstein once said, not everything that’s counted truly counts.
We discuss fees with you up front, and we keep you informed along the way so there are never any surprises. We gauge our value by our results, not by the time spent to achieve them. We provide you with transparency so you can budget with confidence. We do this in a number of ways:
: We tailor our legal services to suit you, your lifestyle and your business. We offer you the certainty of fixed fees wherever possible, or where we cannot fix fees to complete a matter due to its nature or scope, we are happy to provide a fixed cost for stages of work required.
: You can also choose the convenience of retaining us as your virtual in-house legal counsel. These arrangements give you great value for access to us whenever you need us for guidance, strategic advice and identification of potential issues before they become problems.
Our retainer options are designed to give you budgetary certainty based on anticipated levels of service that you and your business needs. We will charge you a fixed recurring fee for you to have us as your on call legal counsel for general advice covering all your legal needs, or we can tailor an option for you to address a specific period of time or work of a particular nature. We check in with you regularly to ensure your selected retainer option is right for you and we are happy to tweak the level of service to ensure you are getting what you need.
We love getting to know our clients and being part of their business. We work with our clients to ensure they are empowered, not dependent on us. We provide clarity. We enjoy helping our clients learn things that other firms will only share for a fee.
We also believe a fully customized experience is key because every business and client is different. We don’t charge you for getting to know you because that doesn’t make any sense. We invest time to learn about you, your business, your goals, your challenges and your vision. We listen to understand where you’re headed and what your plans are before we suggest how you get there and how we can help.

If you’re an entrepreneur ready to set up your business, getting started in the right way will help your business take off, grow and innovate. There is a lot to think about so we’re here to help. 
Prisma Legal can advise you on how to structure your business, engage and formalise client relationships, help you get paid on time and even tailor design your document workflow to streamline your business from the outset. We will listen to your plans and goals to ensure our solution fits you and your business. Let’s get started!
A consultation with you and your team to discuss your business needs;
Identification of how you want to engage, retain and build relationships  with your clients or customers;
Nailing your fine print: preparation of tailored terms and conditions,  quotations, credit application and invoices; and
Business website fundamentals, including e-commerce terms and conditions, website terms 
of use and a privacy policy that reflects how you do business and what you do with the private 
information of those you deal with.
Your brand is your most valuable asset. It’s how your customers identify you and how you distinguish yourself in the marketplace. As your business grows, so too does the value of your brand. That’s why it’s crucial that you protect it.
Trade Mark registration can ward off the copy cats as well as ensuring you have the exclusive right to use your brand and the ability to defend it.
A consultation to discuss your brand and intellectual property needs;
Devising an intellectual property strategy for your business and structuring issues;
Trademark registration due diligence, advice and registration;
IP Licence agreements, if necessary; and
Addressing any IP concerns, oppositions, infringements and defending your brand.
By having contracts in place with your customers, suppliers and distributors you can have greater certainty around payment and trading terms, exclusivity arrangements and intellectual property ownership rights.
Our Close the Deal kit can be tailored to meet your business needs and includes an initial consultation to determine the types of documents your business needs to operate effectively.
How your business operates will determine the contracts or agreements you need to put in place. We will listen to what you need and work with you to draft, review and finalise your business transactional documents, including:
We understand how frustrating it can be to deal with situations where your business is owed a significant amount of money.
We’ll work with you to not only get paid on time, but give you strategies to streamline your collection process, reduce your risk of write offs and help you secure your interests as a creditor of your own goods whilst waiting to get paid.
Our Pay Day kit has two priorities:
To identify key protocols and policies to minimise the risk of debt write offs by:
Ensuring your payment terms are effective and enforceable;
Advising you about how to best secure money owing to you and registration on the Personal Property Securities register; and
Providing practical training to assist in the early intervention of enforcing payment terms to optimise the prospects of debt recovery.
To support you in debt recovery by:
Providing you with a streamlined approach to debt recovery;
Issuing a Letter of Demand to debtors on your behalf; and
Assisting you with enforcement of your payment terms and collection of your debt.
Our commercial approach to transactions focuses on reduction of your risk and providing as much certainty as possible. From conducting negotiations, through to drafting and taking care of all completion requirements, we will ensure your transaction runs smoothly.
Each transaction is unique so don’t settle for a cookie cutter approach to your next acquisition or sale. We are highly experienced in asset and share sales and acquisitions, including the acquisition of equity with respect to specialist businesses. We’ll tailor a process and documentation to suit you and achieve your desired outcome. We work collaboratively with our legal counterparts to ensure we get you across the line as efficiently and cost effectively as possible. Our focus is on you, not on the clock. We’re different like that.
Advising you in respect of your proposed transaction;
Preparation of documents to govern the relationships between business owners (shareholder and unit holder agreements).
Fixed Fees and fixed stage payments can be tailored to your circumstances.
Putting an estate plan in place is one of things business owners often push to the side for “another time”. In reality however, having an estate strategy is the only way you can ensure that everything you’ve worked so hard for is secure and that your wishes are carried out.
At Prisma Legal we can create a strategic estate plan prepared in the context of both your personal and business circumstances and asset holding structures. Our wills are drafted by a lawyer and you will have the peace of mind that your documents will be binding, enforceable and not the product of you simply filling in an online form. We provide you with certainty.
Wills (with or without Testamentary Trusts);
Medical Treatment Decision Maker documents; and
Name of business / company (if applicable)
Other position in business / company

I would highly recommend Fotini to any other businesses seeking a reliable upfront and collegiate legal partner.

Russell Porteous, Managing Director of Firewize Services Pty Ltd
I have known Fotini for several years now and she has been with us throughout our entire journey from concept to operational company. I value our relationship with Fotini highly and trust her implicitly to have our best interests at heart, all the while being a fearless advisor. She may not always say what it is we want to hear but always what we need to know. Her attention to detail and attentiveness to our needs has never wavered. I recommend her highly for her professional approach and depth of understanding of businesses, relationships as well as commercial law.
Stephen Harris, Director of Harcol Pty Ltd
Fotini really understands the legal challenges and unique needs of the SME sector.
Her approach is both refreshingly candid and reflects a deep understanding and application of the law, just as importantly my clients speak as highly of Fotini as I do.
I would recommend a conversation with Fotini if any business should have the need.
Fotini has been great both for our business and for our personal situations. Being a medium sized Engineering and Manufacturing firm we found it difficult dealing with law firms and feeling like the small guys. Fotini takes more interest in getting to know your business not just from the legal point of view, but also strategically and that’s why she is so valuable to us.

I was delighted to have her on my team driving a successful outcome.
