Her assessment was thorough and full of practical recommendations. In particular, it has helped us decide what to tackle first, which is exactly the kind of guidance we were after. She has patiently answered all my questions and recommended other tradespeople. All in all, a fantastic experience. Thanks!                                     
                                Ordered online, excellent service - a prompt email when they were out of stock on a particular item, and fast delivery. PLUS packaged in pre-loved packing materials: always a sure sign of a genuinely sustainably run business!                                
                                I'm a marriage celebrant and bought these gorgeous recycled A4 display folders to give my client's their marriage certificate and vow cards in after their marriage. The quality is exceptional, ordering was easy and intuitive and delivery was quick. Will definitely be back.                                
                                Couldn't be happier! Have ordered 5 times now and love every product! I purchase mostly stationary items for my business. Customer service is friendly and quick, and the quality of the items is outstanding. Highly recommend!                                
                                        This is a fabulous business.

They were fabulous and immediately responded to make sure the items would arrive safely at my mothers and she could contact them to get more if needed. I am truly impressed and grateful to the GGS owners and staff for their care and professionalism. This was all earlier in the year and having had such a great experience and knowing they have a great range and quality of items I have returned to purchase Christmas gifts for other members living there. They have once again not let me down even with the trying postal service issues I hear have been going on. All the gifts arrived on time and I am sure they will delight! I highly recommend either visiting in person, online, or contacting this business for gifts, and green friendly products! Thank you!! I will be back.

She is a highly experienced Scorecard assessor, having completed well over 600 assessments, for private clients as well as government or council supported programmes projects or tenders.
She is also a member of the Residential Scorecard Quality Assurance Panel, whose responsibility it is to maintain the quality and integrity of the Scorecard programme through training and examining new applicants and auditing existing assessors.
Sean is passionate about sustainability and waste issues in particular. He is a co-founder of Going Green Solutions.
Sean is our catering ware and wholesale specialist, handling all customer orders for Biopak products and other compostable items, stock keeping and logistical matters.
Sean is our resident wholesale specialist, warehouse manager and humour doctor, and co-founder of Going Green Solutions. From  handling orders to logistical matters, Sean keeps things ticking over so that our customers get what they want when they want it and can be counted on to hound couriers and sort out problems all day if need be.
Going Green Solutions is a team of people passionate about sustainability, reducing carbon emissions and waste, and helping Melbourne householders live more comfortable, without spending a fortune on energy bills.
By helping our customers understand and reduce their energy consumption, we are helping to reduce carbon emissions and contributing in a positive way to the climate energency.
We are committed to waste reduction and Going Green Solutions have been proud partners of Biopak compostable catering ware products to food and beverage traders for 17 years.
Finally, we really are committed to ‘walking the talk’ and are proud to say that we achieved Certified B Corp status in 2021. We believe in and are dedicated to operating ethically and thoughtfully in all our interactions with customers, employees, suppliers and our precious planet.
Going Green Solutions (GGS) began as a supplier of ‘all things green’ – a business committed to sourcing and verifying genuinely sustainable products. Over the years GGS established a reputation for integrity and service. Customers knew that any product they purchased was genuinely ethical and sustainable – the team at GGS had done the research for them.
After operating out of a shopfront for 15 years in Hurstbridge, Lucinda Flynn, one of the founders of GGS moved into the area of home eergy efficiency assessments, and has not looked back. So much so, that GGS closed its retail shopfront in late 2022 to focus on home energy efficiency assessments and advice, along with the continuation of provision of Biopak products to food and beverage traders.
GGS has won a number of awards over the years, including:
‘ award – Scorecard awards, 2019
‘, Northern Business Achievers Awards 2016 (NBAA)
‘ 2013 and 2011, Nillumbik Shire Council
Sustainability really matters to us, and we consider our impact on people, the community and the environment in everything we do. Here are some of the ways we do that.
We are a Certified B Corp business
businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.
It’s a lengthy and detailed process to gather the evidence required to gain certification – it means proving that you consider the environmental, social and ethical effects of everything you do and make choices that create beneficial impact in those areas instead of causing ill effects. 
To read more about becoming a B Corp Certified business, you can 
 or feel free to get in touch to talk about what it means and what you have to do. 
We are an all electric business
Our electricity supplier is Diamond Energy, who scored 5 stars in the most recent 
 Diamond Energy owns only renewable assets, with zero emissions intensity, has a strong public position against investing in fossil fuels, and does not have contracts to buy energy from fossil fuel power stations
Even though our electricity is already Carbon Neutral, we purchase 100% Green Power
We continually monitor our energy use and look for ways to reduce it – it is already very low
We use only energy efficient lighting, laptops instead of desktops, we have heat pump hot water and reverse cycle units for heating and cooling and solar PV
We have started recording our carbon emissions so that we can offset them
We recycle all our paper and hard plastic office waste, and our printer uses refillable inkwells
We use only 100% post-consumer recycled fibre paper for printing, print double sided and re-use single side printed paper for note books
Our landfill waste and recycling waste is so low that we bring it home and add it to our home kerbside bins (landfill and recycling bins are collected on alternate fortnights). We also have continuous waste reduction targets.
Staff, services & being aware of what our money supports
All our staff live locally so that we continue to support the vitality and sustainability of our local community
We use local and small businesses and services wherever possible to support the economic vitality of our community
We buy Australian made wherever possible – where a product is made elsewhere, it is because there is no comparable Australian made product
We do our banking with Bank Australia, who are member owned. Bank Australia exists to create mutual prosperity in the form of positive economic, social, environmental and cultural impact. Their aim is to benefit their customers, their communities and the planet, they are B Corp certified and they offer lower mortage rates for people who are either making or can show they have made energy efficiency upgrades to their homes.
We have a long history of being active involved in our own community, as well as supporting community organisations who are promoting sustainability, trying to become greener, and teaching others about eco-friendly living. We’re all in this together, and we are proud to be able to work with such passionate organisations. Here are some of the ways we give back our community:
After one year of employment, each of our staff are encouraged and supported to do 16 hours of volunteer work every year within their normal paid working hours, for an organisation of their choice that is creating a positive impact for people and the environment.
Our staff offer one free remote home energy efficiency advice session per month for a person in need (let us know if you know someone in need)
Our staff participate in events promoting sustainability and energy efficiency, such as Sustainable House Day (both national and local programmes), and Speed Date a Sustainability Expert (national and local).
Starting from the 2020/2021 financial year, we have committeed to donating 1% of our profit to a local organisation that creates a positive social and environmental impact.

How does single use catering ware fit into the Going Green Solutions ethos of using and consuming less? 
While we think that reusables are ideal, we know that in some situations, single-use products are unavoidable
. That’s why we offer the Biopak range of certified compostable plant based catering & packaging products. The more food businesses who move to these products, the better we support the movement towards a world in which all single use items are made from plants and not oil.
 and we pride ourselves on communication with our customers to let them know when goods are out of stock or might be delayed. If goods are out of stock we always try to find a suitable alternative for you!

Worried about the price of energy? Trying to understand how to make your home as comfy and efficient as possible? You are not alone!

Pricing (based on how your home would be advertised for sale):
REBATE: Since July 1st 2023, a rebate of $100 rebate is available to Victorian households when they have a Scorecard done with an accredited assessor*. We can offer this as an up-front discount off your bill. (*some conditions apply, but nearly everyone will qualify)
For more information about Scorecard, what happens in an assessment, and testimonials showing how our staff have helped other people, scroll down.
Get more info or book a Scorecard
1 You and your assessor start the site visit with a chat
We talk through your energy efficiency and comfort goals, motivations, time frame, budget (if known) – so we understand what you want to achieve
2 Assessor looks at your building shell & appliances
This includes your building shell (draughts, insulation, windows), and main appliances (heating & cooling, hot water, lighting, pools) and energy generation
3 Assessor enters information into the Scorecard tool. 
Scorecard will calculate the estimated annual energy cost for the home – it’s a great baseline from which to model future upgrade impacts on energy bills!
4 You and your assessor talk through their suggestions
We talk through everything that could be done to improve comfort and reduce energy use, tailored to you and your home. Ask as many questions as you like!
5 We send your Scorecard Certificate & tailored report
These are your roadmap of actions & upgrades into the future. We’ll provide links to products, services, DIY videos & trades who can help.
6 Increased comfort and energy savings into the future
Best of all, you’ll have a practical understanding of how your home uses energy, to guide future renovation or purchasing decisions
Draught proofing makes you feel warmer and reduces the amount of energy you need for heating & cooling. We’ll identify key draughts in your home and talk you through ways they can be sealed, including free Vic Gov upgrades, DIY options and professional services..
Insulation is key to improving your home comfort – it’s like putting a hat, jumper and socks on your home in winter, and it helps in summer too. We’ll look at your ceiling, underfloor and wall insulation, advise you on whether it exists, how well it is working, how you could improve it, and where it fits in priority level for your home. We’ll include DIY and professional options.
Are you keen to get off gas and go all-electric in your home? We can identify your current gas appliances and suggest replacement options that suit your goals, home and lifestyle. We’ll explain the challenges or barriers you may encounter, rebates you may be eligible for, and direct you to some reputable companies who can help you.
After heating and cooling, the production of hot water for your home is often the next highest energy user. We’ll identify the type and age of the appliance you have, and advise you of the most cost efficient and appropriate upgrade options for your home, including rebates available to help you finance your upgrade. We can also suggest some ways to use it most efficiently, even if you don’t upgrade it.
Heating is a large part of our energy costs in Victoria, so choosing an energy efficient option is important. The most energy efficient form of heating is individual high efficiency reverse cycle air conditioners. Ceiling Fans, natural ventilation and split systems are all efficient ways of cooling.
We can help you get off gas to be an all electric efficient home.
Installing solar panels is almost always worth the investment, with an average pay back period of between 3-5 years. We’ll explain how to find a reputable installer, how to use your self-generated energy for best financial benefit, rebates available, and can talk you through some associated thinks like battery storage and Electric Vehicles.
Windows often offer plenty of opportunities for improvement, from low cost and DIY upgrades, to medium and high cost options. We’ll talk you through all of the aspects of windows that matter including internal coverings, glazing, frames, and external shading. We’ll advise you on  how you can reduce heat loss and gain through your windows no matter what your budget is.
What is a Residential Efficiency Scorecard?
About everything to do with making your home more comfortable in winter and summer, more energy efficient, getting off gas, what order to tackle upgrades, and which upgrades will give you the best reward for your investment.
An estimated annual running cost indicator for your home
A Scorecard star rating gives you an indication of the average annual cost to run the main fixed appliances in your home.
The Victorian average is 3 stars, which equates to roughly $1,800 a year. The higher your star rating (out of 10), the lower your running costs, until at 9 stars you are generating roughly the same $ value of energy as you need for the main fixed appliances, and at 10 stars, you are generating more.
As part of our tailored report, we model how your home can get as close as possible towards 10 stars with a range of upgrades.
The Residential Efficiency Scorecard is a home energy rating tool predominantly used for existing homes of any age throughout Australia.
Like appliance star ratings, the Scorecard star rating reflects the estimated annual cost to run your home, based on your current building shell and main fixed appliances. It also has a 'comfort' section that shows how comfortable the home is likely to be without any heating or cooling in hot or cold weather.
To create a Scorecard Certificate, our Accredited Assessor has to look at and collect data about a range of features of your home, including the building shell (draughts, ceiling, wall and underfloor insulation, window frames, glazing, coverings and external shading) and the major fixed appliances (heating, cooling, hot water, lighting, renewable energy).
Our assessors use Scorecard as a great baseline tool for our service, because it gives a homeowner an idea of how energy efficient their home is compared to similar houses. We also find it useful because we can model our recommended upgrades in the tool and show people a practical plan of the steps they could take to get to 10 stars - or as high as possible.
How long does a Scorecard assessment site visit take?
Our Scorecard assessments take anywhere between 1.5-3.5 hours, depending on the size and complexity of the home, and how many questions the householder might have. 
A 2BR home or unit is likely to take 1.5 hrs, 3BR around 2.5-3, and 4BR+ up to 3.5 hrs. 
We take as much time as we need to make sure we understand your motivations and goals with having the Assessment done, and after we've looked over your whole home and collected the data we need, to talk through all of our recommendations and answer any questions you might have. 
Above all, we want our service to be of value to you and we want to leave knowing that we've talked you through your opportunities in way that makes sense and meets your goals, budget and family.
What happens at a Scorecard assessment site visit?
There are 4 main parts to the site visit.
We start with a conversation about your home and the people who live there, your goals and motivations in getting it done, and any challenges you might have in implementing upgrades. This can take 15-30mins.
Then we ask you to take us on a very quick tour of the home so we can see the layout, and also show us where your outside appliances units are (hot water system etc).
After that, we have anything from 45mins-1.5 hrs of data collection to do (depending on the size and complexity of the home). We can do this bit on our own so you can whatever you wish while we work.
Once we have a draft Scorecard certificate and have noted all of our recommendations, we sit down with you again to run through all of our suggestions. We'll explain why we are recommending something, how it impacts on either your comfort or energy use, and point you to resources to help you upgrade it (this could be DIY videos, professional trades, rebates you may be eligible for).
Then within a week of the site visit, we will send you the finalised Scorecard Certificate, a Tailored report for your home, and a Guide to energy efficiency upgrades for further links and resources.
What is included in the Assessment?
The things that are included in the Assessment are:
Onsite assessment, where your assessor talks with you about your goals and your home, collects the data to create the Scorecard certificate and explains their recommendations and how to achieve them.
The types of things we look at are the building shell (draughts, ceiling, wall and underfloor insulation, window frames, glazing, coverings and external shading) and the major fixed appliances (heating, cooling, hot water, lighting, renewable energy).
Follow up tailored report, where all recommendations are listed in order of priority, and suggested upgrades are modelled on the Scorecard tool to show how they impact on your energy star rating and comfort.

Lucinda is a personable and experienced presenter who loves working with peope from all walks of life.
She is an accredited and highly experienced Scorecard Assessor, with a Cert IV in Home Sustainability Assessing, and a Cert IV in Training & Assessing.
Lucinda will work with you to tailor a presentation to suite your needs – but here are a range of previous topics as examples:
An overview of home energy efficiency: the things that impact cost and comfort, all of the elements to look at, and when potential issues are identified, how to upgrade different aspects of your home (and how to prioritise upgrades).
An overview of the impact of draughts in the typical Victorian home, common draughts and how to seal them, rebates, products and suppliers.
An overview of the movement towards going all-electric – why, how and what rebates, products and suppliers can help you.
A hands-on workshop about waste – what is it, how we can avoid it, and what it can be turned into.
(Originally presented to high school students – equally suitable for adults)
Exploring the concept of waste, why it happens and how we can prevent it. Originally presented to high school students as part of a ‘Solutions’ class. It was followed by a brainstorm of what the students and the school could do.
Responding to the Climate Emergency with simple changes at home
Looks at what an ordinary person can do through simple choices and changes that are achievable for nearly everyone.
Green purchasing – catering ware and office supplies
Looks into what green and ethical purchasing means, and why it matters. We look at the linear VS circular economy, how to choose the best green/ethical option for your organisation and the types of questions you need to ask yourself before starting.
Our one to three day training sessions are in home energy efficiency. Depending on the length of the training, participants will learn (to varying degrees):
The context of home energy efficiency in Vic
Which key aspects of a home impact on energy efficiency and comfort?
The movement towards all-electric – why and how?
To identify a range of upgrade opportunities and the priority order in which they should be undertaken for the best advantage to the householder, with consideration for different budgets. This includes:
Building shell upgrades and efficiencies – zoning, draughts, ceiling, wall and underfloor insulation, windows (frames, glazing, coverings, shading)
Appliance upgrades and efficiencies – heating, cooling, hot water, pools, other appliances. How to identify appliances in terms of what fuel they use, their age and comparative efficiency.
Energy generation – the basics of Solar PV – feed-in tariffs, load shifting and maintenance
How to track energy use – online portals, home energy monitor
New nationwide tool – Scorecard. Brief overview

Catering ware – environmental credentials of products
Why are the materials that BioPak uses more sustainable?
Why are the materials that BioPak uses more sustainable?
Ingeo™ bioplastic: Using Ingeo™ reduces raw materialCO2 emissions by 80% compared to regular plastic resin.
Paper and wood: Sustainably sourced from managed plantations and made from FSC™ certified sources wherever possible.
Sugarcane pulp: By-product of the sugar refining industry, which is both rapidly renewable and sustainably sourced.
More information about FSC certified paper products
More information about Bioplastics / PLA products
All Biopak products are manufactured overseas and Biopak accounts for and offsets all emissions associated with the production, distribution and disposal of their products.
Biopak have an exclusive partnership with five production facilities located in China and Taiwan. All suppliers are thoroughly audited to ensure they meet their stringent quality and environmental standards. Production facilities are best of breed and Biopak have processes in place to ensure consistent quality and adherence to environmental practices, including certifications – ISO14001, ISO9001, ISO22000 and many more. Biopak audit them every year to conduct reviews on their processes and business practices and work on an advanced program of continual improvement.
Why is BioPak still using conventional plastic for some products?
Traditional plastics, which are made from fossil fuels, are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. That is why Biopak focus on natural, renewable and fully compostable materials for our packaging. Biopak are a signatory of the Ellen MacArthur New Plastics Economy commitment, the NZ Plastic Packaging Declaration and an active member of the APCO working groups dedicated to find sustainable solutions for the packaging industry. They have publicly pledged to remove plastic from our range by 2025.
Biopak are working relentlessly on phasing out any remaining plastics in our portfolio and adopt new materials as soon as they are commercially viable for our customers.
Is it greenwashing to sell compostables when the current commercial composting infrastructure is limited?
BioPak's compostable products are certified to the Australian Industrially Compostable AS4736 standard and/or the Australian Home Compostable AS5810 standard and can be composted where the infrastructure exists. The BioPak Compost Service provides the link between BioPak customers using compostable packaging and this composting infrastructure. It is available in 15 major cities in Australia and New Zealand covering over 2100 suburbs.
BioPak is driving demand for growth of commercial composting infrastructure by proving that it is an easy local solution that works. They have launched the Compost Connect platform which aims to divert organic waste from landfill by connecting foodservice businesses to composters and certified compostable packaging suppliers. It also connects end users to responsible cafes and councils who choose composting. BioPak's long-term goal is to have council Food Organics and Garden Organics, or 'FOGO' bins, that accept compostable packaging available for residents nationally and beyond. Some councils are leading the way and already offering FOGO bins that accept compostable packaging to their residents. Biopak are actively working with government and industry to push for this to happen. You can help by starting up a local petiton for FOGO bins that accept compostable packaging in your area.
Biopak advocates for reusables wherever possible, but where single-use items are the most viable option, BioPak is committed to providing the most sustainable option possible.
What is FSC™️ (Forest Stewardship Council™️) Certification?
With so many packaging products made from paper, it’s important to ensure our forests are not irreparably damaged in the creation of paper-based packaging. The Forest Stewardship Council™ (FSC™) is an international non-profit that acts to promote the responsible management of the world’s forests. BioPak is FSC certified to ensure the paper-based packaging they create is produced in a sustainable manner, with minimal environmental impact.
Catering ware – compostable products and composting
What are the different types of composting?
There are two broad categories of composting, home composting and industrial composting. Home composting involves piling organic waste and aerating it over several weeks. An industrial compost facility optimises the composting process by controlling oxygen content and temperature in a commercial facility to ensure rapid biodegradation of organic material to produce a high quality, toxic-free compost. Home composts also produces rich compost at the end of the process but may not maintain the right temperature and oxygen conditions for composting PLA products.
What's the difference between the term 'biodegradable' and 'compostable'?
The terms 'biodegradable' and 'compostable' are not equivalent or interchangeable. 'Biodegradable' simply means something will be broken down by microbes over time, which is true for most materials on the planet. Since this term applies to almost everything, it is a meaningless claim that has been abused through greenwashing.
In contrast, 'compostable' means something will break down in a defined amount of time and in set conditions (humidity levels, temperature, etc), such as the ones encountered in home compost bins or in composting facilities.
Like any other environmental claim though, it needs to be substantiated. That is why our compostable products are certified to the Australian Home Compostability AS5810 standards or/and Australian Industrial Compostability AS4736 standards. These testing programs also ensure that the packaging does not hinder compost
What does it mean to be certified industrially compostable?
Most BioPak products are certified industrially compostable to the Australian AS4736 compost standard. AS4736 requires that the product disintegrates after 12-weeks in industrial compost conditions and completely biodegrades after six months. That means that 90 percent or more of the material will have been converted to CO2 and the remaining share is converted into water and biomass. AS4736 also requires that the quality of the compost is not hindered by the products and is safe to be applied to land, quality and that the compost produced can safely be applied to land.
What's the difference between EU and AU compostable certifications?
The Australia compostability certification is the same as European Union (EU) with the addition of an earthworm eco-toxicity test.
How long does it take for a BioPak item to breakdown in a commercial compost facility?
BioPak’s certified compostable range will decompose in an industrial compost facility within 12 weeks.
Can I put BioPak products in my residential FOGO bin?
The BioPak home compostable ranges are usually fine to be placed in the FOGO bins, however, each local council has its own requirements so you need to contact your council directly for confirmation.
BioPak PLA products are accepted in residential FOGO in Hobart, South Australia and some parts of Western Australia.
Can I compost BioPak products in my home compost?
All BioPak products that hold home compostability certification (AS5810) or products made from wood and processed fibrous organic materials (Wooden cutlery, unlined bioboard, paper bags, and napkins) can be disposed in your home compost.
Can I put BioPak products on my worm farm?
You can safely put BioPak's home compostable product range in your worm farm. It is recommended you shred the packaging before you place it in your worm farm for the best results.
Some customers have successfully processed our compostable coffee cups in their worm farms – it takes a bit longer but the worms do eventually get through them. Clear PLA products, PLA cutlery and PLA lids should not be processed in a worm farm.
Catering ware – recycling, landfill, disposal
Food packaging must be clean from food and beverage residue to be eligible for recycling. If contaminated products end up in the recycling they can send a whole truckload to a landfill!
The products below are generally accepted in co-mingled recycling when clean, but it's best to check with your local council to confirm:
Paper board trays (not coated with PLA)
Paper board boxes (not coated with PLA)
PS coffee cup lids (white only)
What happens to BioPak products in landfill?
PLA bioplastic is considered inert in landfill, however our fibre-based products biodegrade in the absence of oxygen. This creates methane, a potent greenhouse gas. This is why it is so important to compost our products after use. Products like paper straws, wooden cutlery, napkins and unlined papers can be composted in backyard compost bins while products containing PLA need to be processed by an industrial composting facility.
If I can’t compost my BioPak products, are they still better for the environment than conventional packaging?
Biopak products are made of renewable materials that have a lower environmental impact than conventional plastic derived from fossil fuels. We source our products responsively and donate 5% of profits to associations that restore forests, help communities in need and grow composting capacity. Some of our products can also be recycled if not too contaminated with food, visit our website for more information.
What is the problem with organic waste in landfill?
When food decomposes in landfills it releases methane which is a greenhouse gas 26-38 times more potent than carbon dioxide and a significant contributor to the climate crisis. We support composting as a circular economy solution for food scraps and compostable packaging, as it avoids methane emissions from landfills and converts this waste into compost which can then be applied to land and sequester even more carbon from the atmosphere back into the soil.
I have a single item of BioPak’s packaging I purchased at a cafe. Where can I get it commercially composted?
Visit Compost Connect to find out if one of your local cafes or restaurants is using a compost service. You might be able to use their bin for small quantities of packaging (with their permission). You can also contact your council to find out if certified compostable packaging is allowed in the green bin. If there's no green bin yet, tell them they are needed! Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial to get Australia on its way to Net Zero, a necessary step to fight climate change.
I have a small amount of BioPak’s compostable packaging from a once-off occasion. Where can I get it composted?
Much of the BioPak range is certified home compostable to the Australian AS5810 compost standard. This means it will break down in standard home compost conditions in 12 weeks. Home compostable ranges include BioBags, BioBoard, BioCane, BioCutlery and BioNapkins.
BioPak's long-term goal is to have council Food Organics and Garden Organics, or 'FOGO' bins, that accept compostable packaging available for residents nationally and beyond. Local councils in Hobart and Adelaide are leading the way and already offering FOGO bins that accept compostable packaging to all residents. We are actively working with government and industry to push for this to happen. You can help by starting up a local petition for FOGO bins that accept compostable packaging in your area.
You may have to put the compostable packaging in your general waste bin for now – but it is still a significantly better option than conventional plastics made from oil. Our products are made from rapidly renewable plant materials and are certified carbon neutral. This means that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, transport and disposal of our products have been independently assessed and offset by investing in infrastructure and activities that offset carbon emissions.
Compost Connect is a not-for-profit composting initiative developed by BioPak, to help connect foodservice businesses to composting services and divert waste from landfills.
From as little as $1 a day, you can divert your food scraps and compostable packaging from landfills and avoid the methane gas this would produce there.

Do Compost Connect service once-off collections like events?
Yes, they can service once-off collections in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. Pricing is case-by-case depending on location, bin size and the number of bins. Email info@compostconnect.com for more information.
Can you accept other brands of compostable packaging?
Our compost partners can only accept packaging that is certified to AS4736 standards. We can only accept packaging if the company name is officially listed on the Australasian BioPlastics Association website as a verified compostable packaging provider. BioPak is currently the only food packaging company with food-service packaging certified to the AS4736 standard.
I use BioPak for takeaway products – will customers really bring the packaging back for composting?
Many Compost Connect members report that their customers love the initiative and do bring their cups and packaging back for composting. We encourage cafes to offer a loyalty card scheme, where each BioPak product returned for composting earns a stamp towards a free hot drink or treat.
Can I get Compost Connect marketing collateral and education materials?
Yes! Compost Connect provides a wide range of promotional and educational material to communicate the benefits of choosing to divert your organic waste from landfills. Promote your sustainability efforts with your free Compost Club pack.

You will receive a free Compost Club pack for every venue that you sign up for a compost service. We also sell additional compost club packs at the cost price of $26.
What will happen to my organics?
Your organic waste will be transported to a commercial compost facility where it will undergo several stages of processing and maturation. In 12 weeks time, it will be a high-quality compost ready for application to land.
For more information, watch "BioPak Compost Service - How does composting work?" video.
What is the shortest compost contract duration?
12-month service is the shortest contract length we offer for the compost collection service. Trial periods are available in some areas at the discretion of our collection partners. Email info@compostconnect.com for more information.
The Residential Efficiency Scorecard is a home energy rating tool predominantly used for existing homes of any age throughout Australia.
Like appliance star ratings, the Scorecard star rating reflects the estimated annual cost to run your home, based on your current building shell and main fixed appliances. It also has a 'comfort' section that shows how comfortable the home is likely to be without any heating or cooling in hot or cold weather.
To create a Scorecard Certificate, our Accredited Assessor has to look at and collect data about a range of features of your home, including the building shell (draughts, ceiling, wall and underfloor insulation, window frames, glazing, coverings and external shading) and the major fixed appliances (heating, cooling, hot water, lighting, renewable energy).
Our assessors use Scorecard as a great baseline tool for our service, because it gives a homeowner an idea of how energy efficient their home is compared to similar houses. We also find it useful because we can model our recommended upgrades in the tool and show people a practical plan of the steps they could take to get to 10 stars - or as high as possible.
How long does a Scorecard assessment site visit take?
Our Scorecard assessments take anywhere between 1.5-3.5 hours, depending on the size and complexity of the home, and how many questions the householder might have. 
A 2BR home or unit is likely to take 1.5 hrs, 3BR around 2.5-3, and 4BR+ up to 3.5 hrs. 
We take as much time as we need to make sure we understand your motivations and goals with having the Assessment done, and after we've looked over your whole home and collected the data we need, to talk through all of our recommendations and answer any questions you might have. 
Above all, we want our service to be of value to you and we want to leave knowing that we've talked you through your opportunities in way that makes sense and meets your goals, budget and family.
What happens at a Scorecard assessment site visit?
There are 4 main parts to the site visit.
We start with a conversation about your home and the people who live there, your goals and motivations in getting it done, and any challenges you might have in implementing upgrades. This can take 15-30mins.
Then we ask you to take us on a very quick tour of the home so we can see the layout, and also show us where your outside appliances units are (hot water system etc).
After that, we have anything from 45mins-1.5 hrs of data collection to do (depending on the size and complexity of the home). We can do this bit on our own so you can whatever you wish while we work.
Once we have a draft Scorecard certificate and have noted all of our recommendations, we sit down with you again to run through all of our suggestions. We'll explain why we are recommending something, how it impacts on either your comfort or energy use, and point you to resources to help you upgrade it (this could be DIY videos, professional trades, rebates you may be eligible for).
Then within a week of the site visit, we will send you the finalised Scorecard Certificate, a Tailored report for your home, and a Guide to energy efficiency upgrades for further links and resources.
