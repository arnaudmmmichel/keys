                The Australian Local Government Climate Change Experts
For nearly two decades, Ironbark Sustainability has worked with councils and their communities to reduce greenhouse emissions, tackle climate change and implement sustainability projects and programs. There are 537 local governments in Australia and 
since we began our journey in 2004, we’ve worked with 260 of them, covering 86% of the population, in every state and territory
If there’s a local government project or challenge that involves climate change and sustainability, then we’re interested in finding out more.
If we can help then we’d love to be part of your project team. If it’s an area outside of our expertise then we’d love to pass you onto the very best people we know who can help you with that challenge. 
Since 2004, we’ve seen state, national and international climate programs coming and going. We’ve seen governments come and go. And we’ve seen funding programs come and go. But real action on climate always starts with a good idea and a good business case.
All through this time, we’ve only ever focused on projects and programs that will lead to 
. Whether on council facilities and assets or in the boarder community, the concept of 
 underpins everything we do. We’re proud that the projects that we’ve been involved in – advising, preparing, or getting our hands dirty project managing – have resulted in real projects that will deliver 
3.64 million tonnes of greenhouse gas abatement
over $550 million in financial savings
With 32 staff across four states, we’re agile and at the cutting edge of new ideas. 
We don’t work for other sectors, our mission is to help councils and their communities – and that is what we focus on. All our senior staff have worked at a council or local government organisation in the past so if you’re from a council or working with local government and want to talk about real action on climate and sustainability, give us a call anytime.
We never charge for a chat and are always happy to share our learnings.

meta title:Lighting - Ironbark Sustainability
meta description:N/A

For Australian councils, street lighting is the first place to start when tackling corporate emissions, with anywhere from 40-70% of a council’s emissions and energy use coming from street lighting. Technology moves and technology changes and now you can’t talk about street lighting without talking about smart lighting and smart cities. There is a raft of community, financial and environmental benefits from ensuring your new lights become the backbone of your smart city. Ironbark are renowned as Australia’s foremost smart lighting experts for a reason. Of the 117 councils around Australia who have completed an LED bulk changeover of their street lights, we’ve worked on 102 of the the projects. In the last decade we’ve also worked on a thousand odd projects around lighting design, open space lighting, compliance mapping and the list goes on.
Of the 117 councils around Australia who have completed an LED bulk changeover of their street lights, we’ve worked on 102 of the projects. We are proud of every single council we’ve supported and the money and effort they have gone to to save over 3 million tonnes of greenhouse emissions and half a billion dollars that are being reinvested in their communities.
We’re involved from the start (developing business cases, helping councils access funding, council presentations, negotiating price and projects with DNSP and manufacturers, design and procurement) to the end of projects (project management, auditing, reporting and project closure). We’re the only organisation to be involved in the full end-to-end management of large-scale LED projects for councils in multiple states. 
If your council has not changed your minor roads or “Pedestrian-Category” lights yet, 
then you’re fast becoming a minority
. There is no excuse for not changing your minor road lights – every old inefficient light up on that pole is using around 5.6 times the energy of your neighbouring councils who have made the change. Every night. Across every light. It’s time to make the switch. There are no barriers we have yet to overcome to make these projects happen.
While nearly 35% of minor road lighting has been changed to LEDs, major roads present a greater challenge because of the complexity of lighting types, design and risk. But the opportunities are enormous with smart lighting savings and community benefits aplenty. Talk to us and make it happen.
Every LED project we’ve been involved in for the last 3-4 years has involved the installation of smart-ready lighting, and the number of variety of smart lighting projects being piloted – and indeed completed – grows by the day. Give us a call to talk about the 
As councils around Australia jump on board the smart lighting revolution and change to smart LEDs in the hundreds of thousands, the next very common project area is developing council-wide lighting policies and guidelines. Many councils are now thinking more strategically about how you manage and plan for the future throughout your council’s lighting. Strategies, policies and guidelines can also been integrated into a smart lighting rollout project.
Clear policies and guidelines are critical if you want a uniform approach to new lighting within your municipality and don’t want to have different departments or staff approaching lighting differently and in the dark. You want to capture lighting levels and asset management process in the one place so if a new council asset manager comes on board or a developer is about to install or replace lights then they have a central place outlining what’s expected with checklists and clear information on hand.
A lighting strategy doesn’t have to be too complicated but is critical as councils start their smart lighting and smart city journeys. As a starting point, the development of a policy can act as a “health check” and then check your progress towards best-practice lighting. A strategy outlines what is needed to manage your assets, how energy efficient they are, how smart and safe they are – all accompanied with an action plan on how to implement them. It’s the lighting strategy and plan that may not only outline areas for improvement but also how to use light effectively to create streetscapes and landscapes appropriate to your community and area. This is the key document outlining how to move forward with smart lighting across the whole of your council. 
Ironbark have been advocating for better lighting, sustainability and cost outcomes for councils and their communities since 2004: From the first ever energy efficient lights approved in Australia (in the Jemena area in 2005), to negotiating fair tariffs and new smart LEDs from South Australia to the Eastern seaboard and everywhere in between. We represent councils on the Public Lighting Approvals Network (PLAN) and review the submissions to regulators that have resulted in savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. We only work for councils, but work with all the key stakeholders and agencies that govern lighting. If you need help talking to a DNSP or other level of government give us a call. 
If you’re about to undertake a project that involves procurement and installation of assets for 20 years then you really need to make sure you’ve undertaken professional expert preparation and design. Public lighting is ubiquitous. Where there are people there are lights. Where there are people there are council residents, ratepayers and stakeholders that will keep you accountable to make sure you’ve made the right decision. And that you planned appropriately. Design saves money and delivers better projects – don’t deliver any large-scale project without integrating the best practice design approaches.
If you’re putting in a new park, bike path, roundabout or walking track then you need to think about lighting at the planning stage. If you don’t think it through before you begin, then be prepared for extra costs of fixing lights or even replacing and digging up surrounding assets post-project. Councils have learnt that making knee-jerk decisions about lighting products and treatment that don’t gel within your surrounding aesthetic and have unintended consequences. A detailed, thorough and expert lighting design will make sure you get it right.
Lighting Level and Light Spill Assessments
Resident concerns around safety, under-lighting, over-lighting or lighting spill is part and parcel of lighting projects. If confronted with concern around lighting levels, we suggest taking an empirical approach that takes the emotion out of the decision and the advice. We’ve got lighting audit and lighting design staff who understand AS 1158 (Lighting Level Standards) and AS 4282 (Light Spill Assessments Standards) like the back of their hands.
Smart lighting is where 3 rapidly changing technology revolutions intersect: solid-state lighting, the internet-of-things (IOT) and a transforming de-centralising energy systems. It’s a fascinating but challenging space so dipping your toes in with a trial first can assist councils in understanding what is available and valuable and help you get third party stakeholders over the line. We’re technology agnostic and as well as having the scientists in our back rooms giving you the hard data and results, Ironbark are born-and-bread local government. This means we overlay technology trials with the broader context councils need – strategically, diplomatically and politically.
Ironbark can check your energy, fault and other data from smart lighting systems and tell you what it means and what you need to do. Being involved in smart lighting projects throughout Australia and understanding all the key software and communications providers and protocols means we know the hints and call-signs: how to find that weird energy spike that should ring alarm bells or the patterns in faults that might result in warranty follow-ups that could save you money. And how to make sure your ongoing monitoring is up to scratch and DNSP-owned assets are performing and passing savings onto you.
Despite the level of control that councils have over metered lights, it is still an often-neglected component of a typical council’s assets. Our advice and process with most councils involves mapping your metered lighting assets, undertaking condition assessments, capturing the unique characteristics (colour, lamp type, pole colour, luminaire type, age, a dozen more criteria) and then providing upgrade energy efficiency and smart lighting recommendations.
There is a time and place for auditing street lights but you’ve got to smart and strategic about it. If you’re finding high error rates and data issues then a field audit makes sense. Likewise, councils with large pockets of decoratives can benefit from a stand-alone audit project to ensure business case development and procurement decisions are made with full information. 
Councils often put up LEDs but don’t see the savings coming through on billing data. We provide a service to remedy this utilising our data and asset nerds but more importantly leveraging our strong relationships with DNSPs to access the right data, advocate for change and restitution, and make it a smooth process. You can of course try working through this yourself – or engage other consultants with less experience to jump on the phone and spend a year getting angry with DNSP call centres and talking to the wrong people for no satisfaction. It’s almost certain we’ll fix it quicker and have the savings flowing asap.

Australian councils and communities have been taking action on climate change for decades. We know because we’ve worked with 260 of them on over a thousand projects in every state and territory. We take an evidence-based approach to climate action. We are only interested in developing council projects that will lead to real action and deliver measurable results. We appreciate that a climate program must have a simple and logical framework that any council – big or small; rural, regional or metropolitan; starting the journey or well advanced – can buy into. We don’t have a program ourselves, there are enough of these out there already. Instead, our climate framework for local government is aligned with leading international and local council programs. Our team of 32 local government and sustainability experts are ready to give you the best advice through every step of the climate action journey.
Almost 72% of Australian councils have a corporate greenhouse gas inventory, either developed internally or with expert assistance. Many councils are now taking the extra step to get their inventory accredited as Climate Active for carbon neutral status. Over the last few decades we have developed hundreds of corporate emissions inventories for local government. Our team includes Climate Active certified consultants, including staff who have worked in local government or are currently embedded in local government. This makes us very well placed to understand councils’ requirements and deliver the approach best suited to your council.
A community emissions profile that is compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) is an important tool for climate planning. It allows councils to understand the scale of the impact of their municipality and the breakdown of sources and sectors responsible for the emissions. This supports decision-making, collaborative action planning, stakeholder engagement and funding applications. It also provides the necessary foundation for the establishment of science-derived emission reduction targets and development of evidence-based action plans and strategies.
Ironbark has partnered with Beyond Zero Emissions to develop an online portal called “
”. This web portal is free to the public and provides modelled community emissions profiles that are compliant with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC). The Snapshot portal is designed to make community emissions data easily accessible for councils and communities, and encourage collaboration between councils and community groups so they can drive real action. This has been built on the development of over 100 GPC-compliant profiles over the last few years including regional approaches such as the City of Melbourne and C40-led Greater Melbourne emissions profile, the Sustainability Victoria Local Government Energy Savers (LGES) program and the NSW Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE) funded municipal emissions profiles. If you would like more information on Snapshot we’re more than happy to talk through the Snapshot approach and its value to council. 
Typically, the approach of all levels of government in establishing climate change targets has been aspirational. That is, they establish leadership and demonstrate commitment to action and are based on factors such as available budget, political will or community expectations. However, they are rarely grounded in what is necessary or possible to achieve.
A science-derived target is a target that is aligned with the Paris Agreement, to which Australia is signatory and which stipulates that we must maintain global warming to within 2°C on pre-industrial levels. The carbon budget for maintaining this level of warming has been calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and scaled to Australia by the Climate Change Authority (CCA). This approach can take the political sting out of setting targets because it is essentially set by externally recognised science. In the age of the climate emergency, working to a science-derived target is the only way that that a council can prove that they are taking the required action. 
Science-derived targets are an essential tool in providing councils with an understanding of the scale of the challenge and providing a frame for further strategy development. This applies at both the corporate and community scale, which is why Ironbark provide targets at both levels. In calculating community scale science-derived targets, Ironbark take into account projected population growth and socio-economic status to provide Council with a target that represents a fair contribution to Australia meeting its commitments to avoid catastrophic climate change.  
Science Derived Targets Local Government Working Group
Through our work with the Science Derived Targets Local Government Working Group, we’ve brought leading councils, alliances and ROCs together to determine how a “fair share” of the national carbon budget is distributed to Australian councils. For more information on our approach or the Local Government Working Group please get in touch.
Climate action planning should always be based on data that demonstrates the available opportunity, future projections and the reductions possible; this is evidence-based action planning. Ironbark has conducted extensive research on the actions and interventions that are available to councils for community climate action planning. Through combining this knowledge base, with data specific to your municipality, we are able to model a range of carbon reduction pathways tailored to your council. The evidence-based action planning framework can provide a detailed understanding of the most relevant, and effective approaches available to your council, and the relative costs and carbon abatement potential of these interventions. This enables councils to make informed decisions and drive significant and measurable carbon reductions within their community.
Modelling the Business as Usual Trajectory 
When planning for action on climate change, councils must consider pathways to emissions reductions that will be effective and efficient. Councils should also be considering how they can increase emissions reductions beyond business as usual, either by making them happen earlier or to a greater extent. In order to do this, it’s important to understand the emissions reductions that are already happening in the community and try to understand how that will change or continue. For example, by understanding the trajectory of the uptake of electric vehicles (EV), councils can consider interventions that help their community to take EVs up earlier or increase the overall number of people that can access EVs.
Ironbark has developed the Community Action Planning Tool (CAPT) which has been built on years of experience developing and supporting council emission reduction programmes. CAPT works by modelling a business as usual trajectory for Council emissions, and mapping this against the costs and carbon abatement trajectories for the different intervention opportunities available to Council. CAPT provides councils with a range of pathways costed in terms of $/tCO2e, giving council an indication of where the biggest opportunities lie, and the budget required to implement the interventions at different scales. The objective of an Ironbark strategy is to enable Council to make informed decisions on the most effective and efficint pathway based on actual evidence. This is evidence-based action planning.
Once an action plan or strategy has been developed, the fun begins. Action!
The strategies and interventions developed can be very different from council to council. Ironbark can support councils to implement these plans in a number of ways. These include but are not limited to:
Ironbark can work with council in facilitating collaborative planning processes with industry sectors, other levels of government, urban and energy planners and other key groups.
We have managed the delivery from feasibility studies, through procurement, and implementation of renewable energy, and energy efficiency projects across the country (check out our 
 page for more information on this action area).
Ironbark can support the development or adjustment of policies and regulations that result in emissions reductions. This includes through road specifications, planning regulation, climate policies or others.
Ironbark can co-ordinate advocacy programs or develop materials to ensure councils are able to leverage their influence at the state and national level to achieve their targets.
If you would like to discuss how our team could support you in executing your strategy please get in touch.
Monitoring, Evaluation, Research and Learning (MERL)
When implementing strategies and action plans, councils are at the forefront of climate action at the municipal scale. It is essential that councils monitor results and share their learnings so that they can understand the effectiveness of their interventions and so that the evidence base in this field can continue to grow. For this reason, monitoring and evaluation is included as a core element of the evidence-based action planning framework at Ironbark. 
Australian local governments have traditionally evaluated projects almost exclusively for reporting purposes – if at all. Most monitoring and evaluation is high-level and light-touch. It is rare the monitoring and evaluation occurs throughout a project, and even rarer that project delivery is modified mid-project based on learnings. We think it’s time to acknowledge that the local government sector has a lot of improvement to be made here. While reporting on internal or corporate projects is more common place, we are missing out on independent and robust MERL throughout projects. How do we really know whether the intervention that a council undertakes is leading to the required and stated action? Are we too often throwing money and resources at ineffective projects? MERL will help ensure that we are indeed taking an evidence-based approach to climate action. 
KPIs, Trigger Points, and Capacity Building
As a core element of any evidence-based action plan, Ironbark will provide a robust MERL programme. This programme is tailored to the specific pathways in Council’s action plan and provides Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), suggested monitoring frequency, and Trigger Points which help Council evaluate if a project is going to plan. Ironbark can also help facilitate the sharing of learnings generated with other councils through networks such as the 
. This is an opportunity for Council to make a valuable contribution to building capacity within the local government climate action sector. Let us know if you want to be a part of it.

We Understand that Council Buildings are Unique
Generally, a council’s building stock will account for anywhere from 20-40% of their total corporate greenhouse emissions. It’s an area that must be tackled to reduce emissions, and presents valuable educational and promotional opportunities for buildings that communities engage with. It is also an area where Australian councils have indeed taken action with 97% of councils installing solar on their own facilities, 93% upgrading lighting in council buildings and 85% implementing energy efficiency programs for large facilities. The technical side of building management is relatively straight-forward. There are many experts out there who can provide specific solutions – for example, experts on HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning), cogeneration or passive design. The complexity is in the strategic side of dealing with buildings, not the technical solutions. Making a public toilet sustainable is straight-forward. Making 50 of them sustainable is harder. We focus on embedding management structures and policies that work for councils in the long-term.
A typical council has between 100 and 800 buildings they manage. One council we work with has over 2,000 buildings. Ironbark understands the complexity of managing sustainability in hundreds and thousands of buildings – from the standard council administration building or town hall, to complex leisure centres and small facilities. Also, how to manage leased facilities, old historical buildings, buildings where councils don’t pay the electricity bills leading to split incentives. We also appreciate the roles and responsibilities of the different parts of council in managing, designing programs and maintaining buildings.
A Sustainable Building Management Strategy looks at a council’s entire existing buildings portfolio and how to manage it over a 10-year period to improve sustainability performance. This includes development and input into capital budgets, identifying key ways that councils will implement and tackle sustainability. For example, improving equipment replacement specifications, targeted retrofit programs, energy performance contracting, solar feasibility and much more.
Developing an ESD (Ecologically Sustainable Development) policy can be very simple or very complex. The complexity is normally around how much a council wants to consult – internally and externally. We often develop a business case along with ESD policy, allowing a council to compare current practice with leading ESD policies and what the capital costs and savings are to improve. We can then assist the whole way – from design, implementation, assessing impact and ensuring you bring the key stakeholders along on the journey.
Ironbark are experts at advising councils on the strategic ways to manage buildings, and also undertake a lot of on-the-ground project management and implementation. Our team of technical experts includes engineers, NABERS and Green Star accredited raters, auditors and project managers.
Building System Check and Optimisation Program
It’s very common for larger council buildings such as leisure centres, swimming pools, libraries, town halls, administration centres to not be working as well as they should. This can be because of a variety of factors – technical, behavioural, process. Our role is to support the people and systems to make them work. A straight-technical fix is rarely sufficient. It doesn’t matter how good a building management or HVAC system is if there are not supporting policies and trained staff to ensure everything is working optimally. We’ve found the most basic changes in practice and process can help – for example, checking and updating timers at a large council library reduced energy by 21%.
Building audits are a good way to get a hit list of potential actions to target. But the reality is an audit is only a first step. In our experience, most recommendations in an audit are unlikely to be feasible, as an auditor is only on site for 2-6 hours, which isn’t enough time to have a sufficient understanding of the challenges of a building. An audit is a good starting point to priorities and implement projects, but the overall management approach is more important. Ironbark have undertaken over 1,000 audits across every state and territory and have also developed the free BART (Building Audit and Rating Tool) for councils to plan, implement and report on energy and water efficiency programs.
Ironbark supports councils with everything from high level solar feasibility across an entire buildings portfolio to project management of delivery. We don’t develop solar panels or work directly with any single provider but help councils undertake the procurement process. This includes helping procure the right solution provider, analysing and assessing different technologies (panels, batteries, inverters, control systems) and third party assessments on whether providers are putting forward high-quality systems.
We’re currently supporting 56 councils in two regions to facilitate large-scale renewable energy PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) projects. If you would like to find out more or are interested in leading your council in establishing a PPA give us a call and we will be happy to discuss the options.

Sustainable Approaches for all aspects of Council
Ironbark uses the One Planet Councils framework which allows councils to set out a clear vision and shared goals for their sustainability strategy, policy and operations against the simple concept of One Planet Living: only consuming our share of one planet's worth of resources. One Planet Councils can strategically shift a council or a team’s thinking on sustainability. Most importantly, it addresses all major aspects of environmental, social and economic sustainability in an approachable, understandable and enjoyable way that is tailored for councils.
Since teaming up with One Planet Living, BioRegional and the Victorian Local Governance Association to introduce One Planet Councils within Australia in 2014, Ironbark have completed the One Planet Council gap analysis for many councils throughout Australia. These include the City of Yarra, the City of Greater Geraldton, City of Moreland, City of Subiaco, City of Bayside, Surf Coast Shire and others.
The first step to determine how your council is going in relation to broad sustainability is to complete an independent gap analysis against the One Planet Councils framework. This involves reviewing the status of actions, policies and targets to improve the sustainability of your internal operations and throughout the broader municipality. It addresses all major aspects of environmental, social and economic sustainability according to the One Planet Councils framework. As a dedicated local government organisation, this experience means we have valuable data and have developed tools that allow a council to find out how they measure up against other councils and international best-practice.
We assist councils in identifying the best ways to transform key precincts into thriving, inclusive and sustainable spaces. We help with a broad sustainability overlay into the strategic planning process via the development of opportunity scans using the One Planet Councils framework; the development of high level sustainability principles; and reporting on what council will need to do to comprehensible integrate sustainability. Completing a gap analysis report of how your precinct or plans compare with One Planet principles is a great start to dip your toe in the water. We are frequently and pleasantly surprised at how this process, coupled with a council workshop facilitated by Ironbark leads to broad sustainability improvements across areas like water, urban heat, biodiversity, food precincts, culture and community.
Good fleet management together with good fleet data is essential to monitor progress and support robust identification of emissions reduction opportunities and decision making in the fleet area. We’ve developed reports for councils around Australia – including metropolitan and rural councils – to review specific options for fleet and address broader fleet management practice. Opportunities to reduce operational costs are often a focus in rate-capping environments, so we take a business case approach. This looks at the actions councils can take, the costs, the timelines, the risks, and the return on investment. Councils understand this is not as simple as just moving to electric vehicles and installing charging stations. It becomes complicated with leasing processes and financial mechanisms that impact on the transition, and understanding how to deal with heavy vehicles, trucks and graders. Our experience working with leading councils like Moreland on the renewable hydrogen waste truck trial, and transport planning groups (such as the Western Sydney Transport Planning Group) all come to the fore here.
