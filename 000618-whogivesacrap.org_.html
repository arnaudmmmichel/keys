    *What's a package? Glad you asked. We pay
    shipping for each individual package we send out. If you order an individual
    box of toilet paper, that's a package. At a certain point, though, the order
    becomes too large to ship as one package, and we have to ship items
    separately. If you order a 48 pack of toilet paper and a box each of tissues
    and paper towels, for example, we've got to ship this as two packages.
    Confusing, we know, but if you have any questions please email us at

We donate 50% of our profits
 to ensure everyone has access to clean water and a toilet within our lifetime
And with your help, we'll get there.
We still have a long way to go, but click above to learn more about how we got here.
Contaminated water contributes to over 1 million deaths per year
A toilet could make all the difference, but billions of people worldwide still live without one. Without a loo, waste ends up in local waterways – the same place people collect water for drinking, cleaning and bathing. That’s why toilets are an integral part of a bigger health initiative called WASH, which stands for water, sanitation and hygiene. Together, these three elements strengthen communities and save millions of lives.
We succeed when communities take the lead
It’s not just a fun rhyme – creating the infrastructure for proper toilets can look a lot different depending on geography, climate, culture and history. That’s why we partner with incredible, high-impact organisations that take innovative, localised approaches to tackle the sanitation crisis.
We couldn't do it without you
There are so many people working toward making our goal a reality – organisations, communities, governments, businesses and, of course, you.

Sure, we love puppies and sunny days and walks on the beach, but our real love is toilet paper. Why, you might ask?
First of all, it's funny. Lots of room for toilet jokes, which we love.
But really, we love toilet paper because for us, it's our way of making a difference. We started Who Gives A Crap when we learnt that 2.4 billion people don't have access to a toilet (now 2 billion – yay for progress!). That's roughly 40% of the global population and means that around 289,000 children under five die every year from diarrhoeal diseases caused by poor water and sanitation. That's almost 800 children per day, or one child every two minutes.
We thought that was pretty crap. So in July 2012, Simon, Jehan and Danny launched Who Gives A Crap with 
. Simon sat on a toilet in our draughty warehouse and refused to move until we had raised enough pre-orders to start production. 50 hours and one cold bottom later, we'd raised over $50,000 
We delivered our first product in March 2013 and have been thrilled to keep growing ever since. Not just because our toilet paper is gracing bathrooms across the country but also because we donate 50% of our profits to help build toilets and improve sanitation in the developing world.
Though we're still growing, and now make more than just toilet paper, we always want to stay true to our roots: toilet humor and making the world a better place.

Doing good has never felt better
Who knew changing the world could be as easy as changing your toilet paper? (Ok, we did.)
 and helps people all around the world.
How many bums can we fit in this little box?
Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bu– wait, what song is that?
Hiya sweet cheeks, it's your mother. You haven’t called in a while. I don’t mean to nag, but my climate change has really been acting up lately. I’m not going to be around for ever, you know? I know you're busy. I just thought I’d mention it. I am your mother, after all. Also, you look warm. Are you overheating?
We also believe that we can make the world a better place when we work together. Sure, over 1 million trees are destroyed every day just to make regular toilet paper. Giant corporations pump out poorly made junk that no one needs. And billions of people lack access to clean water or a toilet. It’s crappy, but we know we have the power to make a change. We just need your help.
Join us to uncrap the world
