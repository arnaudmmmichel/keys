 that the average person spends 80,000 hours at work? I know – it’s a LOT! Our behavioural science consultancy helps make that time not suck by equipping people with the tools and skills to do their best work.
We do this by building three key skills
Are you getting the best out of your people
or are they stuck in their inbox all day? 
Whether working from the home or office, in today’s working world we are constantly bombarded with distractions. Emails, phone calls, instagram likes, endless pings and dings! And, how can anyone possibly get their most valuable, focussed work done when we are in our 85th meeting for the day?
We help organisations to get the best out of their people by developing their skills for Better Doing. Better Doing involves firstly, getting clear on the most impactful thing you can be working on, structuring your time proactively, instead of reactively, and learning how to focus and not succumb to the myriad of distractions that are tempting you.
Help me get the best out of my people
Unless you believe in crystal balls, it’s very difficult to predict the future. But, change is the only constant right? And, this is why it’s critical to build the muscle within your organisation to continually identify opportunities, solve challenges and innovate.
We’ve helped companies all over the world to do Better Thinking. We help you get better at finding the biggest opportunities for growth and improvement in your organisation, generating creative ideas, and testing those ideas in a fast and cost-effective way to avoid expensive failure.

or are they counting down the days til Friday?
Having productive and creative employees is all well and good, but how are people feeling day to day at work? Do you think that your current staff would all love to be working for you in two years’ time?
By focusing on Better Being, you can help your people find more joy in what they do at work. Happy employees are not only more committed and productive, they also make running a business or managing a team a lot more enjoyable and meaningful. Better Being involves giving people strategies to feel more energised at work, form deeper relationships with co-workers, and deliberately reflect on their work so they can learn and grow faster.
We are also leading the way with our thinking
around innovation and how we work.
Being savvy, research geeks, we are constantly sharing the latest research and practical tips around boosting innovation and optimising work practices. You may already be a listener of the top ranking business podcast – How I Work, proudly hosted by our Founder Dr Amantha Imber. We are also pioneering a number of future ways of working such as going all remote and introducing a Four Day Week.

We wouldn’t be true science geeks
if we weren’t into data and assessment.
That’s why we are the official methodology partners and co-creators of two of the Australian Financial Review’s most prestigious lists – the Most Innovative Companies list and the Best Places to Work list. We really know what brilliant companies look like and have a truckload of data to prove it!
We’ve also helped some pretty amazing organisations
We’ve partnered with organisations just like yours and equipped people with the tools and created the environment they need to grow and thrive. Here’s just a few.

Want to help us in our mission to Inventiumise work for people everywhere?
If you love learning, are constantly curious, fiercely focused, passionately productive and innately inventive, chances are, you will fit right in with us. Ask any of our team, and we’re confident that they would say that Inventium is one of the best and fastest-moving places they’ve ever worked.
We are continually re-inventing how we work and striving to unleash the potential in our team and our clients. We may be small, but we punch way above our weight in impact. We also have a lot of fun and many laughs while we are doing it. Here’s a taste of what it’s like to be a team member at Inventium, in the words of our current crew.
"Everyone, without exception, wants to be here 100%. We set massive goals and hunt them down in a sustainable way."
"You have the freedom to bring your own individual strengths to the organisation and are encouraged to be your best self. I feel entirely trusted to manage my workload in a way that works for me and the business."
"You get to work with the brightest, nicest people around. AND you get to help amazing clients everywhere, giving you valuable insights across many diverse organisations."
"Learning a best-practice approach to innovation and being able to immerse yourself in the scientific research that underpins it will be hugely applicable in anything you do in your career. The robustness of the IP makes it is easy to become an advocate."
"Inventium is the fastest paced organisation I’ve ever worked for. It’s challenging keeping up with new initiatives and the volume of changes that we make. We are continually optimising the business and practicing what we preach."
“As an Inventiologist, you are often travelling on a weekly basis. While this is fun, it’s often tricky to manage your routine and energy”.
“There is responsibility that comes with the freedom of working outside of a traditional hierarchy. Self-management takes a while to adapt to. You need to take charge of your own development.”
“While autonomy is a great thing and I love working remotely, keeping connected with the team is something that you have to actively work on”.
We are looking for an awesome…
Sorry! We don’t have any current opportunities to join our team.
But… if you think you could be our next super savvy Inventiologist, add yourself to our invent-e-community. We’ll always share opportunities there and via our Linkedin first, so if something right up your alley pops up, please apply!
What we look for in new team members
We take recruitment very, very seriously and view it as a two-way street. Critical to our process is making sure that you get an accurate preview of both the job and the organisation. Aside from role-based skills, there are a number of core traits we look for to ensure that new team members will really thrive at Inventium. Here are just a few:
You love to learn – We are all passionate about research and are constantly looking for ways to build breadth and depth of knowledge.
You are resilient – Constant change means that you’ll need to be able to recover quickly from setbacks and most importantly, learn from failures.
You don’t take yourself too seriously – People with egos or those who need a hierarchy to feel progress won’t thrive in our team.
You are passionate – About innovation, change, focus, productivity and taking a science-based approach to improving these. You are also passionate about the success of our clients and helping anyone, anywhere!
You are highly self-sufficient and conscientious – we are a close team, however working remotely and highly flexibly means that you will need to Be Your Own Boss. This means being trusted to work independently, being able to solve your own challenges, asking better questions, adopting productivity techniques to work smarter, and always doing what you say you will.
You closely align with our values – this is something that we will explore together throughout our recruitment process.

We are a diverse and fun bunch of Organisational Psychologists, Engineers, and Management Scientists. Our real skill is in making behavioural science practical and relatable to the challenges you are facing. We also have energy and passion in spades, so you’ll love working with us from beginning to end. We may be small in size, but we are big in impact.
Dr Amantha Imber is an organisational psychologist and founder of behavioural science consultancy Inventium. Amantha is also the host of the number one ranking business podcast How I Work, which has had over 2.5 million downloads, where she interviews some of the world’s most successful people about their habits, strategies, and rituals.
In 2019, Amantha was named as one of the Australian Financial Review’s 100 Women of Influence. In 2021, she won the Thinkers50 Innovation Award (described by the Financial Times as the ‘Oscars for Management Thinking’), which recognises the thinker who has contributed the most to the understanding of innovation globally over the last two years.
Amantha’s thoughts have appeared in Harvard Business Review, Forbes, Entrepreneur and Fast Company and she is the author of two best-selling books: “The Creativity Formula” and “The Innovation Formula”.
Mish took the CEO reigns from our wonderful Founder, Amantha, in 2019 and is now passionately leading Inventium to achieve broader reach and impact with clients while ensuring that Inventium remains the absolute best place to work. An avid learner, Mish holds an MBA specialising in technology and innovation from UNSW (AGSM), and a Bachelors degree in Exercise Science.
Mish is passionate about innovative people practices, pioneering our ‘Be Your Own Boss’ structure and continually reinventing the way we work. Outside of Inventium, you’ll find her teaching her gorgeous sausage dog (Rory) new tricks, playing golf, or teaching pilates.
Zoe’s love for innovation was ignited when she spent three years in Switzerland working in the Global Innovation Team at Mondelez, responsible for coming up with weird and wonderful ideas for new chocolate products.
Here, she saw first-hand the value of putting the customer at the heart of the innovation process to drive long-term, sustainable growth. Outside of Inventium, Zoe is very partial to an Espresso Martini.
Head of New Product Development & Inventiologist
Charlotte is an Organisational Psychologist and innovation workshop extraordinaire. She is passionate about the crucial role that the science of psychology plays in creating organisations where innovation thrives.
Charlotte has a wealth of experience working with clients across industries such as legal, property, FMCG and government. She dreams of one day living in Italy where she will be able to speak Italian like a local and survive on coffee, gelato and pizza.
Nick’s main focus at Inventium is to help organisations achieve their innovation missions and to drive Inventium's digital offerings. He does this by using his superpowers in technical analysis, user experience, research and application of the latest scientific findings.
As a qualified chemical engineer, Nick previously worked as a consultant in the chemical, mining and oil industries. Outside of Inventium, Nick can be spotted standing at the back of groups hitting his head on things (he’s really tall!).
After studying PR initially, Georgia quickly discovered a passion for process management and creating workplace efficiencies. This set her on the path to Finance & Business Management and working with progressive and innovative enterprises, both in terms of what they offer customers, and how they manage themselves internally.
A successful weekend for Georgia is characterised by completing the Good Weekend quiz with hubby, while juggling two gorgeous (but demanding) children.
Evelina is a Psychologist and PROSCI Change Management practitioner. She's got bucketloads of experience working inside organisations, which means she's able to give practical advice across many industries including aviation, energy, property, government, education, and technology.
Evelina is obsessed with using science to uncover the best and most efficient ways of doing things in work and life, and then sharing these tips with anyone who'll listen.
When not nerding-out, she can be found wrangling her two young, rambunctious children, diving with hubby or checking out the latest Thermomix recipes.
Obsessed with all things productivity and wellbeing at work you can find Sasha at our many workshops using her background in Organisational Psychology to translate complex science into simple real-world strategies.
Passionate about education, Sasha leaves no stone unturned in her endeavor to empower individuals and teams to get the most out of their workdays. When she’s not an Inventium, Sasha is happiest out hiking or with her nose in a great book.
Coming from a dual Learning & Development and Project Management background across industries including FMCG, technology, government and tertiary education, and as a big fan of the How I Work podcast, the Chaos Controller role at Inventium felt like the perfect fit for (and descriptor of) Hannah’s skillset and interests!
On a typical weekend, Hannah can usually be found screaming her lungs out at the footy (go Dogs!) or spending precious quality time with her family and friends.

In the spirit of productivity, let’s cut to the chase. What do we actually do and how can we help you?
We help people be more productive, happier and impactful at work
Did you know that the average person spends 80,000 hours at work? I know – it’s a LOT! We help make that time not suck by equipping people with the tools and skills to do their best work. 
The two main challenges we typically help organisations with are:
1. How to optimise how you work
2. How to become more innovative
We are not your typical consultancy. We won’t fill your shelves with dust-collecting reports. We won’t put you to sleep with yet another 156 slide PowerPoint deck, full of bamboozling graphs. What we 
 do is energise and inspire you. We’ll equip you with the proven tools you need to succeed and you’ll absolutely love working with us every step of the way. We frequently have clients coming back to us saying that they are still using the tools we taught them many years ago – we love hearing these kind of impact stories!
How we do what we do
Everything we do is based on the latest research from behavioural science, psychology and management science. Our secret weapon is turning this research into practical tools that are simple to embed across an organisation and will actually stick. Proven tools means guaranteed impact. 
The three main ways we can help you innovate and optimise how you work are through:
