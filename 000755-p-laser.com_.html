LASER CLEANING IS PERFECT FOR INLINE INTEGRATION
 of the Low Power devices (50 W to 100 W) can be best described as the heart of our machines for automation. It makes sure the user experience is as smooth as possible.
The laser emission is controlled by 
industry-grade electronics and electrical safety components
. This control makes sure the operator is always working in a
 and is informed about possible errors or faults. 
Different laser programs can be created in our dedicated software 
, guaranteeing optimal process settings, smooth surface finish, and prevention of surface damage. After uploading the various programs on the system, these programs can be selected immediately manual or by robot or external customer device from the display menu so there is No need for a PC to operate this system in an automation mode.
The design of a Mid power system (200 W or 300 W) is 
 than the Low Power unit's design.
Not only does the standard configuration exist of a control unit and a laser source, but also a water cooling unit. This 
 makes sure the source remains cool during operation.
Our unique industrial-grade control system ensures 
 of both chiller and laser source, and provides the customer with all the information he needs!
Of course, multiple laser programs can also be created in

 to cool down the optic and avoid dust onto the lens.   The system is connected to the cloud for remote monitoring.
Optics for automation projects exist in different variations depending on your demands.
We have horizontal and vertical types to mount on your robot or in a fixed position. The processing speed is depending on the mirror scanners used and the focal distance. With the same mirror speed, a focal distance of 500 mm will give you twice the surface speed as a focal distance of 250 mm. Also the spotsize  changes with the focal distance. With the 500 mm focal distance, we have doubled the spot size but reduced the energy density with factor 4. The process setup is critical and we need practical simulation to give our customers the right system. All industrial optics are water-cooled to obtain the stable light output.

 robot, which allows you to clean metal structures 
. Laser cleaning can now be used in even more applications (patent pending).
In some cases, there can be no visible laser light during cleaning, so our R&D department developed this optic system, making it 
safe to operate without laser goggles! 
P-laser developed high-speed scanner for CW and Pulsed laser sources. If you need to clean high-speed sheet metal,  a standard optical scanner cannot generate enough surface speed to have a full surface coverage. The polygon scanner consists of a high-speed rotating multi-facet mirror. We can reach surface speeds till 600 m/s instead of max 30m/s with conventional mirror x-y scanner.At the left side you see a test rig with 2 polygone scanner 1500 watt to clean a moving belt at 60m/min.

 ( patent pending) to monitor the cleaning progress. Industrial applications demand inline monitoring of changes in the base material and the cleaning quality. The used laser is shooting infra red laser pulses to the surface. The present surface contamination will react by being oxidized by the infra red radiation. the transition from the surface contamination will be visible and can be detected by a spectral sensor.Depending on  we will get a spectral snap shot in reference to the surface state ( reflection, absorption) . By making a reference spectral fingerprint of your desired surface state the laser system can in an automatic mode clean the surface till the required quality is reached. This auto-self-regulating system cuts slack time when your input material has variations in contamination and even unwanted substances like Chromium, lead or Zinc particles
 we have an example ( glass mold) where the contamination is always different depending on the production cycle. On a daily basis, hundreds of glass molds must be cleaned.You could program every mold to be cleaned in a fixed time delay off 45 seconds, but some only require 30 seconds. This slack-time optimisation with our spectral sensor will reduce your cleaning time.
Left we have a spectral line print for every pass over the glass mold. The green one is the first cleaning pass, the blue one is the last. The contamination present on the mold surface is oxidized by the laser radiation and sends light back captured by the sensor. After every cleaning pass the contamination is reduced as the quantity of light. With the right algorithm, you can determine your required cleaning level and have a automatic machine learning process.
After each cleaning pass the mold is becoming more clean, but certain sections are more contaminated.
In our spectral measurement, we can detect this and steer the cleaning process to get a homogeneous result, this is very important to obtain a good looking glass bottle.

meta description:P-Laser laser cleaning machines are known for their excellent paint, rust and coating removal, but is also excellent for degreasing and restoration

Industrial laser cleaning systems are most known for their rust removal capabilities. Application can be found in multiple industries as for example 
Our laser systems can be used to derust or deoxidize small machinery or materials which leave the warehouse rusted after being left there for several weeks or months.
Some of the main advantages of using laser cleaning as a rust removal method are the lack of chemicals that have to be used, the substrate is not damaged, very little pollution, etc.

A lot of our customers use the laser's coating removal capabilities prior to any welding, brazing, bonding or new coating process. In the 
 for example, laser cleaning is used to prepare train bodywork for a new coating. Our systems are also capable of removing the paint layer by layer, if you don't want to remove everything all at once.
The laser technique is a non-contact/non-abrasive process, no use of chemicals or blasting media are necessary , we see a reduction in waste, automation is easy and it's very safe. 
 are excellent for in-line coating removal
If you want to manually remove coating on a larger surface and at higher speeds, a 
In the restoration process, laser cleaning has been used with satisfying results in for example stone conservation to remove encrustation. Alongside the aesthetically pleasing results, it is relevant to determine that laser cleaning does not have any adverse effects.
Compared to the more traditional techniques, laser cleaning has many additional advantages. The diameter of the laser beam can be regulated so that areas of different dimensions can be treated. There is no physical contact between the object to be cleaned and the laser equipment. This aspect can be really relevant in treating fragile materials. 
Non-destructive testing is the technique, used in the technology industry, to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing any damage to the base material. Laser cleaning can remove dirt, rust or any other contaminant from the base material, without damaging it. Because of this, laser cleaning is a perfect solution if NDT has to be performed.
Often not the complete surface has to be cleaned, but only certain spots on that surface. Imagine you only have to remove rust on certain spots on a weld or that you only want to clean the rivets on the body of an airplane. That's where spot repair comes in and because of the 2D-scanners in the optic of our laser systems, circles can be created at once, which speeds up the complete process drastically.
You need a clean area to apply glue or insert a spot weld? A laser cleaner might be a very good solution for your problem!

Degreasing is mostly applied in the 
It can be initiated at the end of a process line as a final cleaning solution to remove any dirt, moist or other contaminants. In the end, you're left with a clean product, ready to be sold to the customer. 
Another application is the preparation of a product for a subsequent process: glueing, welding, coating, etc.

meta title:Mould removal | P-Laser
meta description:Laser cleaning can be used for mould removal which are used for the production of food, plastic, rubber, composite and glass products.

Glass moulds have very specific needs when it comes to cleaning. Some of the most important difficulties when it comes to glass cleaning are:
There shouldn't be any increase in volume of for example bottles. Because of this the base material cannot be affected.
Closing edges have to be preserved to make sure no burrs are introduced.
A lot of small holes can be found in glass moulds to make sure air can get out. Laser cleaning ensures good cleaning of these holes and of course no residues are left behind.
 are often needed in the glass industry, just because speed is the determing factor.
find out More about Glass mould cleaning
Speed is the decisive factor when it comes to rubber mould cleaning. For example, cleaning a tire mould (for a passenger car) takes eight hours of machine down-time and the same amount of manual labour time if done in the traditional way (blasting or chemical cleaning). Laser cleaning systems can clean 2m² per hour, a drastical improvement.
A lot of aluminium moulds are used in the rubber industry. Laser cleaning makes sure the base material is not  affected by the technology, surpassing sand-blasting. 
On top of that, laser cleaning technology is able to clean thicker and sturdier contamination, which is very difficult using the traditional methods. 
Just like with rubber moulds, speed is a crucial factor when it comes to cleaning. Laser cleaning succeeds in reaching this speed without damaging the base material.
A lot of plastic moulds have a specific structure that may not be damaged when cleaning. Traditional cleaning methods like sand-blasting cannot guarantee this preservation, laser cleaning can.
On top of that, a lot of moulds are designed with a high gloss finish to transfer to the final product. Laser cleaning makes sure this high gloss is not affected by the cleaning.
 machines if high speed is required
For the food industry hygiene is very important. Food has to be processed in a very clean environment following very strict regulations.
To meet these regulations, it is necessary to clean the moulds in an environmentally friendly way. Sand-blasting or the use of chemical solvents is a no-go. Laser cleaning is an excellent solution because it is clean and very easy to integrate in-line. 
Both Low Power and High Power systems can be used as a mould cleaning solution in the food industry.
In Aeronautics, laser cleaning is used to clean the wing moulds of airplanes. The structure of the moulds has to be preserved, so sand-blasting is not a good option if you want to clean these giants.
Using chemicals can be very dangerous because the base material might be harmed by the toxic chemicals. Apart from that, the chemical waste would be outrageous. Because of the large surfaces that have to be cleaned, high speeds are demanded.
High Power systems will deliver the speed that is demanded.
