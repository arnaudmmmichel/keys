meta title:About Us | Inventorium | Online Learning Platform | Adelaide
meta description:Find out more about us and why we created the Inventorium to help everyone make the shift to online education more efficient.

About Us | Inventorium | Online Learning Platform | Adelaide
The Inventorium was developed in response to the shocking statistic that between 25% and 40% of kids who start year 8 do not complete year 12!  The statistic varies from State to State and how they counting is done, but on average, at least 1 in 4 kids are not completing high school.  Not only is this devastating for the future of the Australian economy, but is a tragedy for the young people who are disengaging.  This sparked a deep dive into the research on student disengagement by the founder of the company and in short, there are 3 key reasons that kids disengage from school:
1.  The pace of the lessons is wrong for them (too fast or too slow)
2.  They are not interested in what they are learning - they fail to see the relevance
3.  Nobody knows who they are - they have multiple teachers for multiple subjects and nobody has a holistic overview of them as a student
There is also a plethora of research and publications on how the education system is failing to meet 21st century needs.
The Inventorium was therefore designed by a group of academics, teachers and corporate professionals to embody a major shift in the way we think about and deliver education, and address the root causes of disengagement in the curriculum design.  The original design was to bridge the gap between disengagement and employability (as qualifications will not be important in the future), but we found that right now - for parents and schools - qualifications are still very important.  Hence the second interation mapped to SACE. 
We also looked at whether it was possible to design a self-paced curriculum that allowed students to focus their learning on what was relevant to them, and have one teacher cover everything.  Maybe the reason that nobody had responded to the criticisms of the current education system were due to the fact that it just wasn't possible to produce what was needed and deliver it at scale?  We've discovered that it is possible, and it can scale, but it impossible to achieve in a traditional school where time is organised by a school bell.  It had to be online.
Our team were early adopters in the online learning space, so we had years of mistakes to draw on. From streaming to the classroom, to streaming from the classroom, we have done it all. We drew on all our lessons learned and a broad base of published research. You can read some of the research reports that inspired us in the Research page in this site. The Covid online learning experience that many have experienced over the last few years is not what we are about. We are about personalised, one to one learning, and we have a retention rate of around 95% with kids who would otherwise not be attending school.	 
The focus of all of our work is on growth, co-creation and transformation. Growth in terms of expanding an individual's horizon with regards to their future; co-creation in terms of personalising the learning journey to power the future they want; and transformation in terms of outcomes for individuals from where they start to where they go next.
One thing we have been very clear about from the start of the Inventorium is that we do not want to compete with anyone.  We were seeking to fill a gap because a gap clearly exists when 25%-40% of kids are dropping out!
Our student base consists of kids who, for whatever reason, choose not to go to a traditional school. This could be due to family circumstances, a disability of some kind, anxiety and/or depression, having been bullied, being excluded from school, or simply disengaging due to the three reasons outlined in the research summary above.
We work in partnership with schools to teach the kids who are on their register but are either on FLO (or the post-FLO alternative), or simply are school refusers. We also run a cohort of homeschoolers through their SACE in partnership with Open Access College. We also sell subscriptions to the platform to homeschooling parents who wish to teach their kids themselves. We are a social enterprise and commit over 50% of any profit we make to improving the curriculum, and also have a scholarship fund for homeschooling parents who need it.

We are a social enterprise and commit over 50% of any profit we make to improving the curriculum, and also have a scholarship fund for homeschooling parents who need it.
Over 60% of our operating costs are directly related to the delivery of our education services (teaching) and most of the remainder is invested in the platform hosting and maintenance. While we are a 'for-profit' social enterprise, our whole raison d'etre is to re-engage the disengaged. Recently we expanded to offer a 'womens leadership development program' which is utilising the platform to support women back into the workforce after they have had a break of at least 6 months, as they face similar barriers to engagement and access. We measure our impact in terms of outcomes and inputs. In terms of outcomes, we focus on retention and engagement as we work with a population of young people for whom these two areas have been problematic. We do not focus on 'academic results' as we negotiate the outcomes our students want to achieve with them and so an external measure is not a valid measure of success.
However, if the young people stay with us and complete the pathway we agree with them, then that is success in our books. In terms of inputs, we consider the proportion of costs associated with running the Inventorium and the proportion of those that are directly attributable to serving our target populations. This keeps us very lean in terms of management costs, marketing and other business expenses and drives us to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, and ensures we provide value for money to all our partners, parents and customers.

meta title:Students And Parents | Inventorium | Online Learning Platform | Adelaide
meta description:At Inventorium, we understand that all students are different, and we make sure we cater to them individually and encourage parents to do the same.

Students And Parents | Inventorium | Online Learning Platform | Adelaide
Why do students succeed with us? 
Every child is different, but the current school model doesn't always cater to that. The school day works around the assumption that all learners work at the same pace, but that just isn't the case. 
Some students get bored because they finish their work quickly, and others get left behind because they didn't understand something, experience processing or other difficulties and they don't have the time to stop and go over it again. 
This has nothing to do with how clever a student is, rather, it's related to individual difference and whether the learning is delivered in a way that can best support each student. 
Students succeed with us because the whole platform is designed around them - not the teachers, subjects, or school timetable. 
We recommend students spend about 3-4 hours a day working on the Inventorium, which is around how much time they actually spend learning at school once you take into account movements between classes and other aspects of the timetable not directly related to learning. 
It is up to students when they learn, so those who struggle with mornings can study in the afternoon or evening, those who have a part-time job can study around their work, and those who have caring responsibilities can study around those.
The student's only fixed obligation is the time they spend in a tutorial with their teacher, and that's open to negotiation.
In a situation like the current Covid-19 disruption, where many parents are being asked to continue working yet also supervise and assist their children’s learning, the Inventorium provides flexibility in managing those competing roles. 
Learners differ in their interests and what they actually want to learn. Some students love science but hate history, whereas others love history but hate maths. 
While there are basic levels of literacy and numeracy that every learner should develop, the way they are developed can vary. All students engage in learning if they are presented with something that interests them - just see how long they spend on YouTube! 
The trick is channelling that curiosity in a way that helps them learn things that will enable them to build healthy and fulfilling lives. Few people like to sit down and work through abstract exercises, but give a student a real-life problem related to their life experiences or their aspirations and they find their motivation. 
Students succeed with the Inventorium because we build the curriculum around their lives. 
If they have particular goals, responsibilities or interests, we design tasks and assessments around those so learning becomes a part of their life rather than an additional burden outside of it.
This helps them achieve both academic goals and life goals simultaneously. 
Most students experience a level of anxiety associated with school, with some really struggling to manage it. The Inventorium’s curriculum is flexible and negotiated, where tasks and outcomes are adapted to avoid triggers for harmful levels of anxiety and where resilience is built. In time, students learn to adapt rather than to give up on learning. 
The emphasis on assessment in the traditional school model connects learning to grades rather than to curiosity, knowledge and personal growth. Many students are particularly worried about assessment, to the extent they disengage from learning, even if content won't be formally assessed. 
The Inventorium does not have any exams and every assessment is negotiated. Of course, some tasks are required for the student to achieve their chosen qualification, but it is up to them how these are evidenced. 
Students are free to choose the work they are happy with, and to put aside work they found less engaging. They are therefore in a better position to celebrate their successes rather than dwell on their perceived failures. 
If your child is disengaging from school, we can work with you and their school to offer an alternative route to success so their rejection of the traditional model does not impact on the rest of their life. 
In our first year of operation (2019) we enrolled ten fully online students who would not attend school, and we finished the year with the same ten students.  As we have expanded from 2020 we have maintained a 95% retention rate year on year.
They all achieved SACE credits and six of them re-engaged in formal learning the following year, either returning to school or studying VET.  As we have expanded from 2020 we have maintained a 95% retention rate year on year and are close on 100 enrolments in our taught programs at the start of 2022.
 We are also continuing to engage with other schools across all sectors, in terms of assisting them to better understand the context of the online learning environment and to offer support to teachers faced with the challenge of supporting student learning during the Covid-19 situation.

“Actually I couldn't stop looking....it's fantastic. What makes it better than other materials I've seen is the interactive nature of the course with videos and reflective activities. The videos are well made and genuine, they don't come across as patronising. I can definitely see the teens I teach engaging with this material. I just did an on-line school leadership course with Harvard Uni and it's similar to that in the level of engagement and quality. Really impressive!” 
Systemic failure of our education system
In 2018, the Federal Government published a report highlighting the need for massive systemic change in the Australian Education system. The report, titled "Through Growth to Achievement", argues that the current system was built in and for the 19th century, so we continue to educate children for the past. Core features of the system have remained unchanged as we have moved into the 21st century, with schools facing a range of constraints including inflexible curriculum delivery, reporting and assessment regimes. According to the 
, student outcomes have declined in 'every socio-economic quartile and in all school sectors… equivalent to a generation of Australian school children falling short of their full learning potential' (Gonski 2018). 
Many schools have made great in-roads to change, offering flexible pathways and alternative provisions that cater to students' needs in all sorts of innovative ways. But the system in which they operate refuses to allow these successes to be nationally recognised or extended to mainstream provision, and hence, they become limited to the small communities who implement them. There have been so many calls for change but no systematic blueprint for how change could be achieved. 
The Inventorium provides a systematic blueprint for change. Our aim is to create an education system that fulfils the recommendations of the 
, while continuing to provide nationally recognised qualifications. For a school choosing to implement this blueprint in full, the implications can be huge: for example, learning would no longer be organised around timetables, subjects, and year groups. The Inventorium also represents a major change for teachers, who are called upon to facilitate content beyond their traditional areas of expertise. The Inventorium requires exceptional leadership and change management skills and passionate teachers who are ready to learn a new way of doing things in order to get started. If your school meets these criteria, we'd love to work with you to co-create the future of education and transform your students' experience of learning. 
We have a 5 Process Framework
 to help you through this implementation, working to a timeframe that works for you and your school.
We want to partner with schools to provide a service provision alongside you, and as part of your ‘brand’.  We do this by working with you to provide a service to those students for whom the school location is not the best place for them to be full-time.  We work online with the students on a one to one basis (as part of a FLO provision with a case worker, or just in partnership with you) to personalise the learning plan to the student and work with them where they are at.  This can be particularly beneficial for students with ASD, anxiety, or behavioural difficulties, and can combine with some time physically in school as well.
With the changing regulations in SA around FLO funding we can now partner directly with schools as well as with case worker providers.
What changes will we see in the long term?  
In short we are offering you an ‘out of school’ experience for the students you are struggling to retain ‘in school’, while allowing you to be part of a leading edge education initiative which builds on the learning we’ve all been gifted through COVID-19, is Gonski compliant, and could be a blueprint for how schools could develop further in the future in a blended model of specialist and interdisciplinary learning.
It's important to keep in mind that many students cope well with the traditional model of teaching and learning. Those who are academically competitive, for example, might miss the emphasis on grades and the ability to compare marks. Students who want to study something with a stronger emphasis on exams and the retention of static knowledge (e.g. law, medicine, engineering) may also be better off continuing in the traditional manner. 
We all know that the teacher is the most important person in a student's learning journey. Students work incredibly hard for teachers they connect with, and their attitude to learning often stems from early educational experiences. 
Research shows that students often disengage because they lose that personal connection with their teachers. Before high school, there is typically one teacher who oversees the student's progress and responds to their unique circumstances. In high school, the student risks getting lost among eight or more teacher relationships and a complex timetable that moves them from place to place and with different mixes of students.
Students are expected to complete a range of different tasks for different people and staff may find it difficult to coordinate their efforts around each student's circumstances. For some students, this can be overwhelming and lead to disengagement.
High school teachers are subject specialists, so they focus almost exclusively on their area of expertise. While this makes a lot of sense, it has become less relevant with the advent of the internet which provides free, cutting-edge content for almost any subject. 
The Inventorium offers a process-based curriculum, in contrast to the traditional content-based one. This means students choose their focus of study and teachers facilitate that with curated use of online content, calling on subject experts only when necessary and as negotiated with the student. This can be a scary prospect for many teachers at first but most are capable of taking on a more generalist role with the proper support. 
The Inventorium students negotiate the curriculum individually, including how they will meet the requirements for each assessment. The teacher facilitates this process using the Inventorium as a base, building on it as they see fit. 
In contrast with the traditional classroom, the Inventorium teachers only have about 20 students - maybe fewer, if they have Special Educational Needs students requiring additional support. This changes how the school allocates work but it's entirely possible to run alongside the traditional classroom.  We also provide a network of Inventorium teachers for them to meet with, and buddy with initially, and undertake Professional Development together.  This strengthens the Inventorium team and feeds back into the curriculum design and improvement process.
The Inventorium can be provided face-to-face with full school attendance, in a blended model with some school attendance, or entirely online. The Inventorium students can have their own learning spaces such as the Networked Hubs above and/or work from home or at other locations (such as the library)m - particularly if they are anxious. They can attend school to do group work, meet with their teacher, and socialise with friends. This arrangement encourages students to take responsibility for the management of their time and to become fully accountable for their work. 
The Inventorium provides school-developed Learning Assessment Plans and Task Sheets to help with the delivery of SACE. With each student negotiating their own assessments, these documents are written quite broadly. This does away with the need to submit individual modifications and it provides maximum flexibility for how students and teachers choose to evidence assessment. This kind of freedom can be daunting at first, so we have staff development groups and an online community where teachers can discuss how to get student work that meets required outcomes. 
Learning how to use the Inventorium 
Teachers do not need to be especially tech-savvy to use the Inventorium as we've programmed it to meet their needs. Having said that, the system looks and thinks differently to all other education platforms in that it's programmed around the student rather than the timetable, course or teacher. It's so different that nobody has an advantage or disadvantage when they start working with it. We find it takes a few weeks for staff and students to settle into a comfortable routine but once they do, it works very smoothly. The key to teaching with the Inventorium is to let go of your prior assumptions and ways of doing things. The student is the one in the driving seat and the teacher's job is to facilitate their growth. 
In the same way every student is different, so is every teacher. We have a range of staff development offerings, from a top end Masters Degree unit which explores online pedagogy, design and delivery, to induction training where our team takes teachers new to the Inventorium through the basics. We also provide written user guides and 'how to' cheat sheets, as well as a chat forum for teachers to share experiences, ask questions, and brainstorm ideas. We can also provide buddying partners so that newbies can talk to someone on a one-to-one basis if they feel stuck or need advice. 
Contact us if you would like to know more. We structure engagement in different packages (all exc. Gst): 
Enrolments are $365 per student per year for the Inventorium platform or $600 per year per student for the Networked World platform.
To train in-house teachers the cost is $2,400 for the first year, and then $800 per year thereafter.  Costs are per teacher.  All prices exclude gst.
 Hubs are available for implementation in-house or as a completely outsourced package by negotiation.
Every Hub is different and so we need to quote individually to meet your requirements.

Other Education Providers | Inventorium | Online Learning | Adelaide
Whether you work with refugees, in the foster care system, with NDIS recipients, or in hospitals – the Inventorium can flex to meet your needs. One of the core design features is that students can work at their pace on the elements that are relevant and of interest to them, so that they do not fall behind in receiving education when they are outside of a school environment for whatever reason. This can be particularly useful for students who are transient, such as students in foster care or moving due to domestic violence issues; or Indigenous students who may need time out to attend Sorry Camps or other community ceremonies.
Do we need to be a school?
While the year 10-12 curriculum requires a school registration in order to gain a High School Certificate outcome, it is not a necessary requirement if that is not the goal. We support homeschoolers, travelling kids and students in all sorts of situations that do not fall within the traditional school pattern. 
We also have a version for RTO's, apprentices and young people entering the workforce directly, either as an intern or as an employee to learn with their employer on the job. More information can be found here: 
Do we need to be teachers?
The curriculum is written in such a way that it is easy for anyone to supervise as it is process based not content based, so the only requirement is that the person who is facilitating the learning is interested in what the student is doing. Anything you get stuck with – 
 that is what we are here for. 
So it doesn’t matter if you are an SSO, a youth worker, a parent, grandparent, or anyone really, so long as you are interested in the student’s learning you will cope.
We must point out, however, that the role of the ‘teacher/facilitator’ is the most important role in the system.  The system does not replace teachers, it just changes the nature of the teaching so that subject expertise is not necessary.
What support can I get if I get stuck?
In addition to our teacher support team, we also have provider groups you can join to share stories and buddy up with other users who can help you get started, and support you if you find yourself unsure of anything. It is not possible to get anything ‘wrong’ in the Inventorium. The students cannot be wrong, the teachers cannot be wrong, and the parents cannot be wrong. The system flexes to meet everyone’s needs, be it an assessment level (they are negotiated), to pace of learning, or outcomes achieved. 
We can also add curriculum to the platform that you want covered, and remove any or all of our curriculum if it doesn’t suit your needs, but you get it as standard when you join us.
"John is loving the forums. It’s his first interaction with online media."
"I've been homeschooled ever since I was in year 2, and before beginning Inventorium, I had little motivation to do my schoolwork, which made it a struggle to even get started with it in the morning."
"Your product looks awesome, much needed in the home educating curriculum market."
