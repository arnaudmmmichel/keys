Among the largest insurers based on market capitalisation.
. If you are eligible for more than one discount, Allianz applies them in a predetermined order. This means any subsequent discount will be applied to the reduced premium amount after applying any prior discounts and the effect of the subsequent discount will be reduced.  For example, the aggregate effect of applying two 10% discounts consecutively means that you will not see the full benefit of both these discounts.
Discounts do not apply to taxes or government charges.
Discounts do not apply to optional covers for Domestic workers’ compensation / Landlord workers’ compensation, and may not apply to other optional covers (if available and selected).
Any discounts/entitlements may be subject to rounding and may only apply to the extent that any minimum premium is not reached.
Combined Discounts. A discount of up to 10% is applied to your premium when you combine Buildings and Contents on one Home Insurance policy, including for the following optional covers if selected: Motor Burnout and Accidental Damage cover. The combined discount doesn't apply to Landlord policies, Flood or Portable Contents optional covers.

Hear the story of Adelaide Hills Winery, 
. They've come a long way since their beginnings in 2012. Laura and Brendan started making wine with grapes from a friend's vineyard. They knew they wanted to grow the business but were concerned about climate change.
After learning about grapes from Italy which were being grown with minimal intervention, Unico Zelo was on a path to more sustainable viticulture. This has grown to significant water reduction, use of native varieties, better pest resistance and sustainable packaging and labelling solutions.
Laura and Brendan knew they wanted a business that had a positive impact on the world. They used B Corp to develop their business which now has almost 20 full time staff, exports to 10 countries and stil supports domestic markets.
Whilst B Corp required significant investment, it has helped build a brand that customers know they can trust.
