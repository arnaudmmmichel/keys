We deliver to customers Australia-wide, with a few far-flung exceptions. 
Find out more about how we deliver
Koala does not deliver to my postcode, why? What can I do?
Unfortunately, due to increased shipping costs we are now unable to deliver to some remote or rural postcodes. Whilst we’d love to deliver to ALL Aussies, transit costs to these areas far outweigh what we can reasonably charge customers, and may still result in unsatisfactory experiences. 
We appreciate this is less than ideal. If your postcode is not supported we suggest arranging collection from a serviced postcode address, if at all possible.
When will I receive my delivery?
If you're in one of our same-day delivery areas (Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth) you can select a delivery time that's convenient for you. 
Order a mattress or furniture item before 3pm on any weekday and we can deliver your order within 4 hours, if its in stock. Weekday evening and Saturday morning deliveries are also available!
Small items when ordered on their own (including bedding, bed linen and pillows) will be delivered FREE across metro areas. Please check your delivery date estimate at checkout.  
Outside of our same-day delivery areas delivery is still completely free. Your items will be shipped from our metro warehouses so delivery will take longer. You will receive your delivery in 1-10 business days.
Is delivery free everywhere in Australia?
We offer free delivery to almost everywhere in Australia for any order that includes a mattress. Small item delivery is free, always, but we charge a delivery fee for bulkier furniture items. Enter your address at checkout to confirm if there are any delivery fees to your location.
 when you order a mattress and an item of furniture, the premium rate of $199 will apply. You’ll then get your furniture item/s delivered and assembled in the room of your choice, as well as rubbish removed. 
How can I check my delivery details? (costs or time)
Enter your postcode into the delivery checker at checkout to confirm if we deliver to your area, see a delivery estimate and whether there are any delivery fees to your location. 
What are large, medium & small furniture items? How does it impact my delivery?
Your delivery is impacted by the size and weight of the items you're ordering.  
 for a breakdown of items and delivery costs or enter your postcode at checkout.
How is my delivery fee calculated?
Delivery fees are calculated by the size and weight of your order as well as your location.
They sure are. Any order that includes a mattress qualifies for free delivery, no matter where you live when you choose standard delivery. 
 when you order a mattress and an item of furniture, the premium rate of $199 will apply. You’ll then get your furniture item/s delivered and assembled in the room of your choice, as well as rubbish removed. 
Do you deliver to my apartment door?
For standard delivery, our delivery drivers will deliver to your apartment door if your apartment has a lift. If your apartment does not have a lift, our drivers are happy to deliver up to 3 flights of stairs (i.e. 30 steps).
, the delivery and assembly of your furniture will take place in your room of choice, regardless of whether you live in a house or an apartment. 
How do I recycle the packaging?
When you get rid of packaging thoughtfully not only is it better for the environment, it can be reused to create new products. 
Paper and Cardboard (including Honeycomb Cardboard) - Flatten your cardboard boxes or rip them up before placing them in your recycling bin in order to save space. You don’t need to worry about removing any tape or labels from your cardboard boxes. They will be removed in the recycling process.
Soft plastic packaging - While these are recyclable, In Australia, soft plastic packaging can’t be recycled through most kerbside recycling services. You can recycle soft plastics through the REDcycle bins found at Coles and some Woolworths stores.
Woven Polypropylene material / bags and Bubble wrap (large sheets cut into A3 size pieces) - The REDcycle program makes it easy for you to recycle your soft plastics - simply gather together all your scrunchables and drop them into a collection bin at participating supermarkets. 
If you’re ever unsure what the go is, pay a visit to recyclingnearyou.com.au or contact your local council, or 
take a peek at our blog
 for some great ideas on how to reuse and recycle the packaging. 
Or, if you’d prefer we take your rubbish away and ensure it’s recycled properly, you can opt for our premium delivery service at checkout. This also includes delivery and assembly in the room of your choice on top of rubbish removal. 
Will I get a heads up when the delivery is on its way?
Yes, we'll send you an SMS when your delivery has left the warehouse.
If you're in one of our same-day delivery areas (Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth), you will also receive a live tracking link in the text so that you can see where your product is at any point in time!
Do I need to be home to receive my delivery?
If you choose standard delivery, we can leave your delivery somewhere safe if you're not home. Make sure you tick the box during checkout to let us leave your package unattended.
If you choose our Premium Delivery Service, someone needs to be home to let the delivery team in to assemble your furniture and remove your rubbish. 
Do you deliver after work hours? Can you deliver on the weekend?
If you're in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane or Perth you can select a delivery time that's convenient for you - weeknights until 8pm and Saturday mornings included! 
Find out more about how we deliver
 These extended hours apply for our standard delivery only. 
Can the courier bring my delivery inside my home?
All our furniture items are delivered by a courier to your nominated delivery street address. For safety (OH&S) reasons our couriers are not allowed to enter your home, or carry the items up more than three flights of stairs. If you think you’ll struggle with the bigger or heavier boxes, we recommend inviting someone over to help.
Please note if you live in an apartment block, our drivers may not be able to take your items to your front door so you may have to meet them at the front.
In certain metro areas, we do offer a paid Premium Delivery Service where customers are able to access an all-in-one delivery, assembly and rubbish removal service. If this service is available to you, you’ll be able to select this service at the checkout.
Can I pay more for express delivery?
Given the sheer size of Australia, it can take a bit of time to get to the hard to reach places so the best we can do at the moment for regional and rural deliveries is 1-15 business days. If a better, faster method comes up, we’ll be just as keen as you to make it an available option.
It is saying I am ‘regional’ but I consider myself ‘metro’, who dictates these categorisations?
We calculate our delivery charges on how much our delivery partners charge us and this is based on the distances from a city centre. In most, if not all, cases we do not pass the full delivery cost onto our customers. However, in instances where it’s really costly, we kindly ask for a little help in getting our furniture out to you.
If I am paying for delivery, can I receive my product quicker?
We currently deliver within 1-15 business days to most regional and rural areas which is pretty speedy (especially compared to other furniture retailers). We’re passionate about delivering the best service to our customers so we’ll continue to figure out easier and quicker delivery options.
If I have a warranty issue with my product, will I have to pay for the return delivery fee?
We assess all warranty claims on a case by case basis to make sure every claim is handled fairly. We will not charge you a return delivery fee if we deem that the appropriate measure. Additionally, we will not ask you to pay for the delivery fee for any replacement product either.
If I return my furniture product under the 120-night trial, will I get a refund on the delivery fee I paid?
Yes, returned products under our 120 night trial will receive a full refund, including original delivery fees.
Koala used to provide free delivery nationwide, why are you charging for furniture-only orders?
When we started, we were a mattress brand, and it was our promise to deliver mattresses to every corner of the country for free. We’re still delivering on that promise with delivery remaining FREE for all orders that include a mattress when you choose standard delivery. 
And getting you your goods fast is still our priority - we continue to offer same day furniture delivery to metro customers. We’re constantly working with our partners to keep our delivery prices on the low end (and well below what other furniture companies charge).
We're still 100% committed to treating you like a mate, with our hassle-free service, still with free returns for metro areas, and 120 night trial.
 for your order, we’ll deliver your furniture in a room of your choice, assemble it, and remove all cardboard and plastic rubbish. This will incur a flat cost of $199, regardless if your order is furniture-only or also includes a mattress.

Kloudcell® is Koala's own proprietary high density polyurethane foam, which offers superior support, breathability, responsiveness and durability.
What is fabric made from TENCEL™ Fibres?
TENCEL™ is made from sustainably-sourced wood. The process used to create TENCEL™ fibres is eco-friendly, and has won awards for its low environmental impact. The result is a fabric that's more absorbent than cotton, softer than silk and cooler than linen. 
What does the SE in Koala SE Mattress stand for?
This is our way of saying "sleep easy".  This mattress has all the know-how of great sleep, at an affordable price - so you can sleep easy!
Should my new Koala mattress smell?
Like many new products (new car smell anyone?), mattresses that come in a box have a scent which generally dissipates quickly after unboxing and removing packaging, though it can sometimes take up to a week or more to fully disappear. 
If you notice a scent, rest assured that Koala mattress foam is made without formaldehyde, are low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds), and meet CertiPUR-US® standards for content, emissions, and durability, and are analysed by independent, accredited testing laboratories. 
Allowing the mattress to breathe in a well-ventilated space (like open windows, ceiling fan, door open) or vacuuming the mattress on a low setting helps draw out and remove this scent. We know this isn’t always practical (especially in winter!), so if you don’t, just be prepared for the scent to seem stronger or linger for a while longer
