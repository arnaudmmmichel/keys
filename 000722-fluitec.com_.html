We use Fluitec ESP to extend our compressor maintenance interval.  We have  machines that are running just because we have Fluitec ESP on them.  What were three or four year (maintenance intervals) is now five or six years.  We are able to extend the life of the oil to the maintenance interval of the machine.  I feel the advances we’ve made in our lube oil program is from Fluitec helping us. We understand our oil better and we now know how to take care of our oil even more.
Fluitec is most proactive and innovative in bringing the solutions to Shuaibah IWPP to extend the life of our turbine oils and avoid costly oil changes and shutdowns. We have no reservation in recommending Fluitec as a top contributor in the field of turbine fluids health.
Throughout all these steps, Fluitec's staff was most helpful, available and effective. They have been most proactive in following-up on progress of the treatment, consistently exceeding our expectations. Based on our experience, we recommend Fluitec and its ESP technology to anyone who needs to perform a varnish decontamination of turbines, and so to reduce.
Fluitec has transformed the oil in our fleet of gas and steam turbines into Fill-For-Life lubricants. We have never changed our oil and even more we have never had a trip due to a lubrication related issue. I attribute a lot of that to Fluitec and Boost AO. When you consider we would have changed the oil twice by now and even conservatively averaging lube oil related trips and fail-to-starts, the savings are in the millions!

Discover the Full Potential of Boost VR+
Sludge and varnish are the scourge of industrial plants, as they cause a multitude of problems. These deposits, whether they become a hard crust on the machine or settle as brown, jelly-like grease, interfere with the performance of the hydraulic fluid and the machine, like:
Damaging seals (which lead to a host of problems)
Exacerbating wear and corrosion of the machine
These inefficiencies cause downtime and lost revenue, while damaged equipment accrues huge repair bill. It’s imperative, therefore, that facilities remove varnish and sludge from machine systems.
FILTERS 1 WEEK AFTER ADDING BOOST VR+
But Conventional Solutions Can Be Damaging
To flush out the varnish and sludge from systems, many companies rely on chemical flushing, which contains detergents and dispersants. While chemical flushing is effective at removing deposits, the detergents and dispersants can damage the machine. In fact, even minuscule amounts of these cleaning agents can lead to compatibility problems and threaten the performance of equipment like your turbines or compressor oil.
It’s a varnish removal solution that won’t damage your equipment or hydraulic oil.

Eliminate Lube Related Shutdowns, Trips and Fail-to-Starts
The following mechanical problems lead to 
Increased wear on valves and other components
Shortened life of lubricant, filters and seals
And they all have one thing in common: Varnish and Sludge
You have bigger things to worry about than free-radicals and oil degradation molecules forming and depositing in your system.
Don’t wait until you have a deposit problem which requires excessive money, time and energy to solve.
Stop varnish and sludge before it even starts
ESP technology relies on the principles of “chemisorption.” ESP selectively removes oil degradation products that are in suspension or in solution without disturbing the fluid’s additive system. For optimal performance, ESP media is fully customized for each application and is selected based on oil type and condition.
How it works: the power of selective Chemisorption
As oil degradation byproducts (depleted antioxidants and oxidized base oil) make contact with ESP media, the specific mix chemically targets and removes the contaminants through strong adsorption forces. This ensures it will not be released back into the oil. ESP has a high capacity as it uses the full volume of the media, not just surface area.
“The reliable operation of our turbines & compressors is of critical importance to Siemens. Providing our customers with Fluitec’s ESP technology allows them to extend the life of their lubricant assets while improving plant efficiencies and uptime.”
Don’t take our word for it, download the Siemens technical article. 
(HINT: Check out the last page of the document)
The tests that provide the highest value in predicting turbine oil varnish are the individual antioxidant monitoring and
 in combination with particle counting.The earliest sign of oil degradation is detected with voltammetry (
 method) since the antioxidants are the most reactive species in turbine oils and are the first to deplete.The most important test to predict varnish formation is the Membrane Patch Colorimetry test, which measures the color of the sub-micron oil degradation products, as well as particle counting. It is preferential to use these tests together to provide a more complete picture of the varnish tendencies of the turbine oil.
