"We love building – with a passion for delivering quality projects, the team at Arc enjoys the opportunity and challenge of working across a variety of projects and scales."
The team at Arc share a genuine passion for their work and maintain a dedicated attitude throughout projects of varying scale. Having worked across both commercial and residential projects Arc believe successful projects are collaborative and built on open communication.
Arc is a small-scale operation that has the advantage of taking a personal approach to each job. Led by Brad Swanson, with avid work ethic and design sensibilities, his team and their network of quality tradesman take every opportunity to provide an uncompromising level of service.
Placing importance on developing and maintaining strong, transparent relationships with all parties, Brad strives to make building a positive experience for everyone involved.
Arc is a craft orientated builder that specialises in urban sites defined by non-typical detailing. A core team is appointed to each project, they will have an in-depth understanding of the build and its every component from the excavation to the joinery.  They are collectively responsible for the end to end delivery and understand that foresight is paramount to coordinate sub-trades, accommodate services and uphold architectural intent. The core team assigned to each job work proactively, communicate honestly and are continuously looking to improve our service and seek out innovative solutions.
Follow our work, watch our progress.
We partnered with @carbonneutralAU to plant 380 trees in the Yarra Yarra Biodiversity Corridor of Southwest Australia to actively support the revegetation of degraded farmlands. A portion of our profits goes directly towards protecting and restoring this land. 
Sustainable, considered and thoughtful systems and solutions from the site to office. We are proud to have recently been awarded BCorp Certification, and are currently offsetting our carbon emissions via Carbon Neutral Australia. 
Quality, Time and Money. We are happy to negotiate the second two variables but never the first.
Drawing from experience and a trusted network we can help you with concepts, plans, and council approval.
Reliable, respectable and dependable end to end service, flexible to your needs.
An ongoing committed service to your projects, regardless of whether they are big or small.
We are always open to expanding our current team of apprentices, labourers, carpenters, foremen and administrators. If you are interested in working with Arc., email your resume to brad@arcprojects.build

            Once a part of a large industrial factory on Parramatta Rd which was converted to apartments by a developer in the mid 1990's. We are currently stripping one of the double height apartments back to its bare concrete past before installing a new steel structure. This will form a new layout designed to bring natural light into every space of the apartment.

Master Builders Excellence in Housing Award Winner - Alterations + Additions
Contemporary renovation to a heritage terrace. Opening up the ground floor into a free following living space with steels doors and the joinery extending the living space into the walled courtyard. Timber is the star of the project and much of it was recycled. A Japanese cedar bath the feature of the bathroom and tied in nicely with the charred cedar used externally.
