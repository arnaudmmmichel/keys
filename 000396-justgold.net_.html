What is the "Find your Hashtag" Program?
At Just Gold we work with a vision of a just world where everyone has access to opportunity.
In a world full of wicked problems we often come across people and teams that work hard to solve complex social issues but become absorbed in their day-to-day activities.
Most of the time, they face challenges in communicating their needs; they also lack resources to access effective programs, funds and other opportunities. 
In some instances, they end up trying to ‘fit’ into a program or give up. That is the foundation of our Find Your Hashtag program. 
With Find Your Hashtag we offer bespoke low bono or pro bono services that empower social enterprises or NFPs to better serve their social purpose better and foster creativity.  
Based on the UN sustainable development goals we work towards equality by fostering equal access to opportunity for organisations and businesses. Our program works with S.M.A.R.T. goals. Our actions and programs are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and with specific Timelines.
With our impact program, we share our knowledge, skills and expertise in a transparent, comprehensive and measurable way that results in collaboration & innovation to deliver systemic change.

Starting from the ground up was challenging, as no one in Australia had previously combined a management consultancy, a digital and creative agency with impact expertise, and a social enterprise. We returned to square one, and with the assistance of like minded friends and partners, established 
Today our team consists of a diverse group of partners, employees, associates, contractors, and collaborators, each with unique backgrounds and experience in overcoming adversity while striving for professional excellence.
