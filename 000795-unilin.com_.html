At Unilin, sustainability is our top priority. We take responsibility for protecting our planet. But being sustainable means more. It is also about the quality of life of those who buy our products: our customers. And creating a sustainable working environment for our employees.
Through an annual sustainability report, we provide transparency on our progress, as well as the obstacles we are facing. This allows us to make adjustments where necessary. Third parties such as the Science Based Targets initiative and Cradle to Cradle® check our claims.
Sustainability requires a radical transformation in our processes and our use of raw materials. At Unilin, we have seen challenges as opportunities since the outset. And that certainly remains the case today.
To ensure that the innovation we develop within the company is sustainable, we have drawn up a Sustainable Innovation Framework.
Our company centres around innovation, entrepreneurship, passion and smart living solutions. We understand the power of collaboration and cross-pollination better than anyone else. We pool the know-how from the different divisions, in order to learn from each other.
