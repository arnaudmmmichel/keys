What Is Sustainability and Climate Change Consulting?
Sustainability and climate change consulting is a tailored advisory service that helps businesses and governments successfully adhere to compliance regulations. 
It also helps these bodies to identify and implement sustainable, innovative and efficient decarbonisation strategies. 
Businesses and governments use sustainability and climate consultants long-term to leverage their unique and specialised technical skill sets. Consultants help businesses reduce their emissions and expand their climate ambitions over time. 
What Do Sustainability and Climate Change Consulting Firms Do?
Sustainability and climate change consulting firms assess their clients’ current practices, then suggest ways that they can reduce their environmental footprint and strategically decarbonise their organisations. 
They offer companies tailored advice and develop and implement customised plans that help businesses work towards a greener future and reduce their negative impact on the environment. 
They also help organisations assess their risk and take advantage of the opportunities that the transition to a decarbonised economy presents. 
Sustainability and climate change consulting services may include:
Assessing the client’s current practices, risks, and opportunities
Evaluating the client’s current environmental footprint through carbon accounting
Assessing and reporting on sustainability data, including ESG metrics
Formulating sustainability strategies that are tailored to their industry, risk and opportunity profile and budget 
Creating sustainability strategies and holistic and detailed road maps to emissions reduction and net zero

Educating client leaders and teams on sustainability initiatives, frameworks and reporting 
Providing ongoing support and advice; for many clients, this is done through an increasingly ambitious climate action journey
Being at the forefront of new technology solutions and keeping clients informed of changes to relevant laws and compliance guidelines
Why Should You Consider a Sustainability and Climate Change Consultant?
Navigating sustainability regulations and frameworks can be incredibly nuanced and complex. 
Additionally, most companies lack the time and in-house technical expertise required to develop strategies and innovative solutions for a decarbonised economy.
Therefore, the safest, most effective way for a company to successfully comply with regulations and move through their climate journey is to seek the guidance of an experienced and skilled consulting team.
A sustainability and climate change consultant combines their technical, scientific and regulatory knowledge — as well as their industry expertise — to provide you with a clear roadmap based on your unique position. 
This takes the confusion, inertia and guesswork out of the process, empowering your business to move forward and begin making a positive impact.

What Is Sustainability and Climate Change Consulting?
Sustainability and climate change consulting is a tailored advisory service that helps businesses and governments successfully adhere to compliance regulations. 
It also helps these bodies to identify and implement sustainable, innovative and efficient decarbonisation strategies. 
Businesses and governments use sustainability and climate consultants long-term to leverage their unique and specialised technical skill sets. Consultants help businesses reduce their emissions and expand their climate ambitions over time. 
What Do Sustainability and Climate Change Consulting Firms Do?
Sustainability and climate change consulting firms assess their clients’ current practices, then suggest ways that they can reduce their environmental footprint and strategically decarbonise their organisations. 
They offer companies tailored advice and develop and implement customised plans that help businesses work towards a greener future and reduce their negative impact on the environment. 
They also help organisations assess their risk and take advantage of the opportunities that the transition to a decarbonised economy presents. 
Sustainability and climate change consulting services may include:
Assessing the client’s current practices, risks, and opportunities
Evaluating the client’s current environmental footprint through carbon accounting
Assessing and reporting on sustainability data, including ESG metrics
Formulating sustainability strategies that are tailored to their industry, risk and opportunity profile and budget 
Creating sustainability strategies and holistic and detailed road maps to emissions reduction and net zero
Guidance on implementing and embedding sustainability plans into the overarching business strategy 
Educating client leaders and teams on sustainability initiatives, frameworks and reporting 
Providing ongoing support and advice; for many clients, this is done through an increasingly ambitious climate action journey
Being at the forefront of new technology solutions and keeping clients informed of changes to relevant laws and compliance guidelines
Why Should You Consider a Sustainability and Climate Change Consultant?
Navigating sustainability regulations and frameworks can be incredibly nuanced and complex. 
Additionally, most companies lack the time and in-house technical expertise required to develop strategies and innovative solutions for a decarbonised economy.
Therefore, the safest, most effective way for a company to successfully comply with regulations and move through their climate journey is to seek the guidance of an experienced and skilled consulting team.
A sustainability and climate change consultant combines their technical, scientific and regulatory knowledge — as well as their industry expertise — to provide you with a clear roadmap based on your unique position. 
This takes the confusion, inertia and guesswork out of the process, empowering your business to move forward and begin making a positive impact.

What is an example of an energy audit?
An energy audit evaluates how a business uses energy. This is an important part of any decarbonisation pathway. 
During an energy audit, your sustainability auditor will take inventory of your energy use, equipment and practises. They will identify energy use hotspots and patterns that may suggest energy waste or inefficient practises. They will then recommend ways to improve your energy usage, for example, by swapping out equipment for energy-efficient alternatives, shifting energy loading times and transitioning to a cleaner energy source.
What are ERF or carbon offset audits?
ERF audits are conducted in line with Australia’s Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, under the Clean Energy Regulator’s (CER) Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF). Audits are crucial for CER to verify issuing of Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs).
The auditing process is complex and rigorous to ensure the reported abatement truly reflects the actual net reduction in emissions for a specific project during the designated reporting period. 
We are one of the most active and skilled firms in this space and have audited hundreds of ERF projects – both land-based and industrial. For more than five years we’ve been a member of the Clean Energy Regulator’s Audit Panel.

The leading carbon neutral certification program in Australia is the Federal Government’s 
 Carbon Neutral Program. We have one of the largest teams of registered Climate Active consultants in Australia supporting carbon neutrality under Climate Active. We support clients in all aspects of carbon neutrality and the Climate Active process including:
Creating a carbon account in line with the applicable Standard
Managing the external data verification audit
Facilitating the purchase and retirement of carbon offsets with a reputable broker
Managing the administration and reporting with the Climate Active team
Carbon offsetting is a way to reduce or offset business emissions that cannot be avoided through other emissions reduction means. We support our clients to achieve carbon neutrality through the procurement of certified national and international carbon offsets. Our team guides clients to align their offset strategy with their corporate sustainability objectives and priorities, to achieve both environmental and social outcomes. We work with Australia’s leading carbon offset provider, 
, which has the required licences, track record and due diligence processes to operate effectively in this space.
We also assist clients to build a carbon offset strategy for self-generating offset projects. For businesses with the opportunity, a carbon offset strategy with self-generating carbon offsets can be an excellent way to mitigate the risks from the future price of carbon. It can also become a rewarding, cornerstone piece of any organisation’s 
 (or net zero) strategy as well as broader sustainability goals.    
Science-Based Targets - Net Zero Pathways
A commitment to carbon neutrality or net zero emissions demonstrates tangible action to reduce emissions and leadership in the shift to a low carbon economy. We are one of the leading consultancies in supporting organisations and government entities in responding to climate change. We assist organisations in all stages of their carbon neutral or net zero journey, from guidance on setting and measuring ambitious reduction targets, or setting and certifying 
 (SBTs), to net zero trajectory and modelling, and Climate Active certification. View more information on science-based targets and our services 
Modelling emissions trajectories to meet net zero targets enables businesses to implement the appropriate strategy and initiatives to reach these targets. We support clients in modelling their emissions under a business-as-usual scenario, compared to various policy scenarios. We can benchmark this data against peers and State and Federal targets, to provide a comprehensive understanding of their ambitions and current initiatives. We supplement this with modelling of carbon offsets that may be necessary to supplement planned emissions reduction initiatives; and provide recommendations on meeting targets.
Calculating and reporting on their carbon footprint underpins all climate action and allows organisations to understand, manage and reduce their impact. Our team is collectively one of the most experienced in the market, providing fit-for-purpose carbon accounting services for medium to large businesses. We love the phrase, ‘You can’t manage what you don’t measure’, and our specialists are adept at calculating carbon footprints and emissions from the most complex to the most straightforward sources, across all sectors and under key frameworks, including the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting scheme

An unprecedented number of businesses and local governments are taking leadership in tackling climate change by setting a net zero pathway for their organisation. Going net zero refers to achieving an overall balance between greenhouse gas emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere. We’re one of the leading consultancies supporting organisations and government entities in understanding their carbon footprint and developing mitigation strategies to achieve net zero. We do this in line with best practice against the requirements of the international 
. This includes building business commitment; measurement of carbon inventories; setting targets; developing a strategy and managing risk; taking action on emissions reductions and resource efficiency; and reporting.
 (SBTi) offers one of the most credible, globally recognised approaches for setting emission reduction targets. Setting a science-based emissions reduction target (SBT) allows an organisation to understand their fair share of the carbon budget and ensures that emissions reductions are in step with science, future compliance obligations, and stakeholder expectations. Setting a science-based target also increases innovation opportunities, cost efficiencies and provides a competitive edge. We assist organisations on the journey in selecting the right science-based target approach depending on size and industry, understanding the main emissions drivers (Scope 1, 2 and 3) and where significant emissions reduction initiatives can be implemented to ultimately achieve the set SBT. View more information on science-based targets and our services 
Nature-based climate solutions are a vital contributor for the world to meet its Paris Agreement net zero targets. They are also critical in halting and reversing habitat and biodiversity losses. Ndevr Environmental’s Nature-based Solutions team assists clients and landholders to investigate opportunities for carbon projects to sequester carbon and improve land condition under both National and International carbon abatement and environmental standards.
Our team are experts in identifying cost-effective and impactful nature-based solutions, that protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural capital and modified ecosystems. 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
 (TCFD) is a framework for businesses to ensure that the impacts of climate change become routinely considered in management decisions, and to improve and increase the reporting of climate-related financial risks and opportunities. It has fast become the leading international framework setting a new precedent for climate-related risk management and opportunity identification for large and listed companies as the world transitions to a clean energy future. We assist organisations to analyse their corporate governance in line with the TCFD recommendations; understand and analyse foreseeable climate risks and opportunities to the business; set metrics and targets; undertake scenario analysis and strategic reviews; and prepare company disclosures in line with the TCFD framework.
Organisations are under increasing pressure to manage the impacts of climate change-related risks to their business. For more than 10 years we have worked with some of Australia’s largest organisations to develop and implement their climate strategy to ensure they succeed in an increasingly carbon constrained future. Our guidance often focuses on change management and balancing structural decarbonisation with carbon offsets. This delivers a climate change strategy that turns climate opportunities into strategic business value. We utilise approaches including internal carbon pricing and Marginal Cost Abatement Curves, which are based on deep and current industry knowledge, to provide pragmatic and usable solutions.
Carbon offset projects are used to reduce or offset business emissions that cannot be avoided through other means. We support business with the development, registration and ongoing management of carbon offset projects under the Federal Government’s 
Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011
. Our experienced team provides support across both the industrial and land sectors, to support clients to earn Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) and reduce their climate impact. We have worked as both auditors and advisors on carbon offsetting projects which collectively have saved tens of millions of tonnes of CO
We also assist clients to build a carbon offset strategy for self-generating offset projects.

We are market leaders in securing subsidies and capital grants to drive implementation. Our emissions reduction service streams include: feasibility assessment and implementation support, energy productivity, renewable energy solutions, energy procurement and carbon offsetting.
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme
 is Australia’s national framework for reporting and disseminating company information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and energy consumption. The 
 is designed to limit emissions increases across the economy and can lead to significant financial cost if not managed correctly. Complying with NGERs and the Safeguard Mechanism can be a complex and resource intensive process, which is why many organisations choose to partner with us to oversee their reporting obligations. We have one of the most experienced teams of NGER experts in Australia, with diverse skill sets including engineers, economists, policy professionals and data analysts. Over the past decade, we have worked with many of Australia’s largest emitting companies, helping them comply with complex and ever-changing legislation and using this as a lever to identify carbon, energy and cost saving opportunities.

Founding Ndevr Environmental – Our Story
The world is demanding higher human rights standards from all organisations. Embedding human rights principles into organisational governance is increasingly an expected part of doing business.
We help our clients identify and understand the often complex social and human rights issues that affect their business. We focus on the integration of social goals into sustainability imperatives to identify risks and opportunities. We’ll help you measure your baseline, set targets, and build and implement strategies to achieve them.
Real-world examples of the impact our clients are making in the areas of Modern Slavery and broader Human Rights strategy.
Modern Slavery Readiness Assessment & Reporting Preparation
For our counter-slavery support services we deploy an array of tools enabling clients to benchmark their position, quantify supply chain risk, and analyse how best to proceed. These tools make demonstrating year-on-year progress easy by quantifying the client’s counter slavery process.
The video below is a brief introduction to our Modern Slavery Risk Assessment Tool, which we use to quantify supply chain risk and create an actionable picture of a Client’s supply chain. This assessment is used to target supply chain engagement and measure year-on-year progress for each annual slavery statement.
Our Human Rights team have extensive experience in supporting organisations to analyse, measure and implement human rights strategies to mitigate risk and align purpose with profit.
Heading up the team are Director of Ndevr Human Rights Brian Kraft and Senior Consultant Roohi Ghelani, supported by the wider team. Reach out to the team below.

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that measure non-financial indicators. They are increasingly used as a measurement for investors to evaluate businesses in which they might want to invest. The ‘Social’ score is often undervalued, however organisations which do not address this key element will underperform. We help clients boost their social performance indicators to make them more attractive to workers, investors, and buyers.
Our team can assist with the following ESG services:
Selection support for the right ESG standard
Current-state & gap assessments to build an ESG roadmap
Implementing improvements to boost ESG scores
It is increasingly important for companies to identify and address human rights issues across their business. We build corporate and sustainability strategies with robust human rights pillars linked to measurable standards, such as the 
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
, or leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics.
Developing an actionable human rights strategy allows an organisation to reach certification goals, enables them to better respond to legislation and market demand, mitigate risks, and attract and retain talent. Our services are flexible and fully aligned to the strategic objectives of each client. 
Mitigating modern slavery risk in operations and supply chains is a requirement under Australia’s Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) for organisations turning over more than $100m. We guide our clients’ counter-slavery responses, both mandatory and voluntary, in a number of ways, depending on their needs. This includes measuring slavery risk in everything purchased, developing an in-house supplier management tool, training procurement and operational staff on identification and response, and implementing remediation and engagement strategies. Our counter-slavery work is framed around complying with the Australian Modern Slavery Act and achieving continuous improvement year-on-year, to ensure our clients are standing out amongst peers, while mitigating material risks to business and people.
We also provide guidance around the recently introduced NSW Modern Slavery Act for NSW Government agencies, local councils and Statutory owned corporations, to assess and recognise the risks of modern slavery in their supply chains and understand and comply with reporting obligations.
