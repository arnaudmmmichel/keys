Soil Health Mentor – A Must Do
Chatting with Luke is nearly a must do, because he is about the big picture and the pieces which need to go together.
We are saving 20% on fertiliser costs by spending 50 cents per Hectare on inoculating the grain with NutriSoil concentrate before sowing. Then in August a foliar spray with NutriSoil costing $50 per hectare as against $228 per hectare on conventional fertilisers. Head weights 3...
We were really happy with the visit from Luke and can see he offered an all-round service to help achieve soil health.
Soil Health Mentor – Refreshing Views about Regen Ag
It was refreshing to hear Luke’s views about regen ag as it has been distorted, Luke spoke about all the tools in the tool box, which was great.
Soil Health Mentor – Good Ideas to Try New Things
Luke has some great ideas and certainly a good start for someone wanting to try new things, he has good ideas on how to balance soil nutrition
Diane and Ian Haggerty Tells Their Success in Growing Crops in Sand
Using NutriSoil, our soils have opened up. They infiltrate water at a much faster rate.
Since we started using Nutrisoil it was clear to see that the cattle started grazing the whole paddock ore evenly. The improved health of our cattle was also noticeable.
A word from Dr Christine Jones on NutriSoil & Nitrogen
Just about everything that lives in soil is very strongly inhibited by applications of high rates of water-soluble N and P. Interestingly, a small amount (say 1-5kg/ha urea) primes the system. I guess the amount of N in NutriSoil does the same. The microbes only need a whiff of N...
We were amazed at how quickly soil can and does respond to NutriSoil – especially in Australia – where chemicals have now been used so extensively for so long. The future in farming is really exciting again with the thought of moving away from the...
I have used Nutrisoil now for some years and although I have grown very good vegetables in the past, I have found that Nutrisoil gives that extra flavour and extra growth that home gardeners look for and after growing vegetables in my home garden for...
Dr Maarten Stapper writes on the Soil War we cannot win
Maarten is passionate about discovering and using the power of nature in food production systems – and the connections between soil biology, soil health, and the overall functioning of agro-ecosystems, and sees many opportunities for Australian agriculture to reverse soil degradation and regenerate soils.
“Soil Fertility Management, Towards Sustainable Farming...
Walter Jehne share’s the connection between Healthy Soil Nutritional Integrity in Food and Human Health
Effectively the nutritional integrity and thus health value of our food and our health is governed substantially (up to 90%) by whether it contains and can provide us with the over 33+ essential nutrients, trace elements and plant products (vitamins etc) that are essential for our preventative health.

Made from harnessing the power of earthworms to drive natural fertility and healthy growing conditions.
What can it be used on?
NutriSoil is suitable for application on all growing plants and soil types. It can be used as a foliar spray or seed inoculant and in fertigation systems.
Apply NutriSoil on plants during growth stage for immediate uptake and coat seed at sowing for greater strike rate.
How much water do I add?
Mix 5L/ha with water according to the calibration on your sprayer. E.g. If your sprayer puts out 100L per hectare, use 95L of water with every 5L of NutriSoil. (This is a 5% dilution or a 20:1 ratio).
The water rate is not critical. It acts as a carrier to distribute 5L/ha across plants and/or seed if doing in-furrow fertilisation. NutriSoil can be easily adapted to fertigation systems.
Apply 5L/ha in growth times such as Autumn and Spring or other growth opportunities due to irrigation or seasonal influences. There is no stock withholding period. Animals may even remain in the paddock during spraying.
Inoculate seed with NutriSoil at 5L/tonne and/or use in liquid inject systems at 5L/ha.
Apply 5L/ha of NutriSoil at the 3-leaf stage.
Apply 5L/ha as a top dressing if required.
Apply NutriSoil 3 to 4 times a year up till harvest with no withholding period.

meta description:Find answers to frequentrly asked questions about NutriSoil's organic liquid fertiliser made through a vermiwash recycling system.

Trial Comparisons to MAP, DAP, UREA, SUPER
What sort of equipment do you need to spray out NutriSoil?
Broad jets, triple jets or boomless flat spray nozzles are all suitable. Any equipment used for spraying out liquids will be ok. It can be as simple as fire fighting equipment, hand pumps, units on ATVs to elaborate boom sprays. If it has been used for pesticide sprays, clean thoroughly with a suitable sterilizing compound. Nutrisoil is non-corrosive and will not harm equipment.
No. NutriSoil is filtered prior to packaging to ensure no solid matter can cause blockages. NutriSoil stays in suspension.
Can I mix NutriSoil with Herbicides/Pesticides?
Definitely do not mix with pesticides as this will kill micro-organisms thus losing the biologically active component of the product. Farm trials have shown that NutriSoil can be mixed with and sprayed out at the same time as mild herbicides and in fact has improved the effectiveness of the herbicide and delivered good results in the paddock. However, thorough trialing has not been carried out on a full range of herbicides so we cannot guarantee there is more benefit than harm to the product when combined with herbicides.
Can I use NutriSoil to replace NPK fertilisers?
NutriSoil can be used in conjunction with traditional fertilisers to get better value by unlocking nutrients or as a stand-alone fertiliser. On our Yackandandah property we have not used conventional fertiliser programs for over 15years replacing them with vermiculture (worm-based) products. Soil tests have shown improvements in NPK and other major/minor elements. Most of the property was acidic with pH levels as low as 4.2pH and without the addition of Calcium we have lifted this to 5.9pH. Used in conjunction with Super-phosphate, NutriSoil’s biologically active component or stimulant helps to unlock phosphorous that commonly gets locked up in soil.
Why is NutriSoil effective when it doesn’t have equivalent high levels of nutrients when measured against NPK fertilisers?
Trials show equivalent yield map productivity on wheat, triticale and lupins of 5L of NutriSoil/hectare compared to 100kg Urea…. There is an argument that maybe plants just don’t need such high levels of nutrients as suggested but the crucial element is that the nutrients need to be in a ‘plant-available’ form. The unique difference with NutriSoil is that all the quality natural animal, plant and ocean materials used to make the end product are fed through a vermiculture (worm) system thus carrying out the conversion process. Therefore once applied to crops/pastures there is practically instant take-up of nutrient by plants.
What is the difference between using NutriSoil over worm castings?
NutriSoil is a liquid spray. The benefits of nutrients being soluble is that they are in a readily available form to be taken up by plants within 2-4hours. Liquid fertilisers are easier to control application rates and nutrient levels. Where 250kg of worm castings are equivalent to 5L NutriSoil it is obviously more cost effective with regards to transport.
What is the difference between NutriSoil and worm juice?
Worm juice is commonly made from diluting worm castings with water. NutriSoil, whilst derived from a vermiculture (worm) system is significantly more advanced. It combines the benefits of the finest organic animal, plant and ocean sources fed through a vermiculture system. The liquid is extracted from the system as a concentrate with no added water.

Just about everything that lives in soil is very strongly inhibited by applications of high rates of water-soluble N and P. Interestingly, a small amount (say 1-5kg/ha urea) primes the system. I guess the amount of N in NutriSoil does the same. The microbes only need a whiff of N...
We were amazed at how quickly soil can and does respond to NutriSoil – especially in Australia – where chemicals have now been used so extensively for so long. The future in farming is really exciting again with the thought of moving away from the...
I have used Nutrisoil now for some years and although I have grown very good vegetables in the past, I have found that Nutrisoil gives that extra flavour and extra growth that home gardeners look for and after growing vegetables in my home garden for...
Dr Maarten Stapper writes on the Soil War we cannot win
Maarten is passionate about discovering and using the power of nature in food production systems – and the connections between soil biology, soil health, and the overall functioning of agro-ecosystems, and sees many opportunities for Australian agriculture to reverse soil degradation and regenerate soils.

Walter Jehne share’s the connection between Healthy Soil Nutritional Integrity in Food and Human Health
Effectively the nutritional integrity and thus health value of our food and our health is governed substantially (up to 90%) by whether it contains and can provide us with the over 33+ essential nutrients, trace elements and plant products (vitamins etc) that are essential for our preventative health.

Shallow root systems do not allow for access to water in dry times.
Larger root systems allow plant to hold on longer in the dry.
We were amazed at how quickly soil can and does respond to NutriSoil – especially in Australia – where chemicals have now been used so extensively for so long. The future in farming is really exciting again with the thought of moving away from the harshness of chemicals, back to what our grandparents have – that becomes a PASSION. Well done NutriSoil for sticking with it – all the way!
Trials carried out in 3 paddocks with control areas on Barley, Annual Sub-Clover and Permanent Pasture. 4 weeks later trial and application areas stood out like chalk and cheese. Barley and sub-paddock were distinctly greener and lush compared to untreated areas. Less obvious in pasture paddock although cattle grazed only pasture where NutriSoil was sprayed.
Trials done on wheat, triticale and lupins found no difference from the yield map between Urea and NutriSoil. 5L of NutriSoil was used as an equivalent of 100kg Urea only NutriSoil was half the cost. Better to save the money using NutriSoil, especially if the rain still holds off as it is not wasted.
The most valuable and noticeable improvement is in the health of the stock. We haven’t lost an adult animal to illness since.
Unproductive terrain now holds good grass and clover and when Graham digs weeds he is delighted to find worms underneath.
Stimulating biological processes on horse arena
We have followed up with further application to event areas. Soon we will use the fertiliser on the agistment areas. The good thing I feel about this process is that we are stimulating the natural sub soil biological processes, not just spreading chemical synthetics and hoping for the best.

NutriSoil functions differently to conventional fertilisers.
Conventional fertilisers feed the plants but are detrimental to the life in the soil. The following results tell the story of what is happening as you apply these conventional fertilisers.
Microbes are significantly reduced in numbers on application of MAP, DAP, UREA and Superphosphate.
On application of NutriSoil microbes are significantly increased in numbers and diversity.
NutriSoil will feed the plant AND the microbes in your soil. In this system your soil fertility will continually increase as opposed to the straight conventional system which degrades soil fertility.
NutriSoil works as a complete fertiliser when used in a whole farm management system. Results show that NutriSoil produces comparable production to a conventional crop.
NutriSoil also works with a conventional system where a portion of the conventional fertiliser is replaced with NutriSoil. A soil full of microbial life can withstand some chemical usage.

NutriSoil Pty Ltd is a biological solution made by worms, which is manufactured, distributed and wholesaled direct to farmers. The business was started by Graham and Lyn Maddock in 1995. The first worms were purchased to start the first windrows in 1990.
The NutriSoil product was developed by farmer Graham Maddock and his brother Ian, on the family farm at Yackandandah, Victoria. NutriSoil biological solution is an organically certified, award winning, concentrated worm liquid, produced from a unique Vermiculture Recycling System.
A farm chemical accident for Graham Maddock in the mid-1980s triggered a rethink of chemical and fertiliser applications and set in motion the establishment of the now thriving all-natural company.  While recovering from serious health problems caused by the chemical exposure, he thought about the risks that using chemicals posed to other farmers and also the health of the consumer at the end of the supply chain.  Farming with his brother Ian Maddock and son Darren Maddock, they experimented with vermiculture (worm farming) and using the castings and worm liquid on a crop of water chestnuts and the dairy pastures.  Impressed with the results, this led the Maddock family on a lifelong journey to learn how plants and soil function naturally and further development of the biological stimulant, NutriSoil.
The family sold the farm and moved the business to Baranduda, close to Wodonga.  This was more central for business services, such as freight and also allowed them to purpose-build the NutriSoil Education and Production Facility.  It was opened by Cr Rodney Wangman former Mayor, City of Wodonga on the 25th July 2007, before an audience of 140 farmers.
