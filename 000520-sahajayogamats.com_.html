"Buy a yoga mat, give a solar light"
Proudly the first yoga mat company in Australia to be a certified B Corp!
Sahaja yoga mats, luxury eco-friendly printed yoga mats created by a yogi for yogis.  The base is made from natural tree rubber. The soft microfiber absorbent towel is made from recycled plastics, to give the mover a yoga mat and towel in one. The combination together gives you the sweaty grip of a towel and the support of a yoga mat. No more adjusting towels during your practice or slipping on a sweaty mat! The yoga mats can also be reversed, depending on your practice.
Sahaja’s printed yoga mat designs are all based on Sacred Geometry, yogic texts and life experiences.  Each design is original and unique, created from the heart with thought, utmost love and care.  The designs themselves are created to form organic alignment cues for the mover on the mat.  The mats are not just beautiful and give back, they are also functional with a purpose and a deeper meaning.
Sahaja Yoga Mats are printed using high tech heat sublimation printing, with non-toxic water based inks.   Sahaja Yoga Mats are perfect for all styles of yoga and have been tested by yogis for yogi.  They have been in heated rooms, non-heated rooms, on epic road trips, flown in airplanes, left in hot cars for weeks, camped out under the stars, played in yoga festival, danced on at concerts, sunbaked on beaches, swan through the surf, tumbled in washing machines, hung out to dry in the Sun and are still epic and vibrant!  
First time use, spray it down with a little water to help with the grip. 
Sahaja yoga mats are 72in*24in (1830*610mm) and 72in*26in (1830*660mm) slightly longer and some wider, than what is on the market, with varying thickness.  Sahaja yoga mats are great for sweaty Ashtanga, Hot Yoga or any style of yoga. No towel needed, which means no more playing around with your towel when you sweat.
The more you sweat, the more you will grip.   For the hot yoga, Bikram yoga students, a Sahaja yoga Mat is ideal!! No more carrying sweat soaked yoga mats that drip on others as you leave the room or standing on sweat soaked mat. Ewe!  Sahaja's luxury yoga mats are absorbent and are also perfect for Hot Pilates, Mat Pilates, Yin Yoga, Kundalini Yoga and other mat or exercise classes.   
All Sahaja Yoga Mats have been tried and tested by yogis for yogis.
If there is light in the soul, There will be beauty in the person. If there is beauty in the person, There will be harmony in the house. If there is harmony in the house, There will be order in the nation. If there is order in the nation, There will be peace .

"Buy a yoga mat, give a solar light"
Proudly the first yoga mat company in Australia to be a certified B Corp!
All Sahaja Yoga Mats are all inspired from Sacred Geometry, ancient yoga texts, tantric philosophies, energetic bodies as well as life experiences.  
Each printed yoga mat design is original and unique, created from the heart with thought and utmost love and care.  The designs are limited editions and the designs have been specifically created to be alignment cues to help the mover on the mat with their alignment and practice.  
With the Fibonacci yoga mat below, you can see the "centre" of the yoga mat.   We have used circles instead of a traditional line.  When the yogi or mover on the mat places their hands or feet on either side of the circles, they'll be able to see whether one side is higher, lower or maybe the stance in their warrior is slightly out and make the necessary adjustments for themselves.  The organic alignment cues are in every single Sahaja Yoga Mat.
The imagery helps the yogi to stay present and mindful during their own practice.  Sahaja Yoga mats 
unique and intelligent alignment designs are perfect for those who self practice on their own without a physical teacher there.  Sahaja Yoga Mats unique designs, allows the yogi to find their own alignment for their body by using the imagery, instead of using markers for where to place feet or hands.  As every being is unique and every time the yogi creates a yoga shape, where they step or land will be in a different position to the last time.  
So not only are the mats beautiful and give back, they are also functional with a purpose and a deeper meaning.
For first time use, if need, you can spray it down with a little water to help with the grip or even throw it in the washing machine.
In the right light, at the right time, everything is extraordinary.
