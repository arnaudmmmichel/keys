The three parts of every compliance program
We’ve helped over 200 trailblazers to level up their compliance game
“I don’t say this lightly, but we are super stoked that we chose to work with AssuranceLab who have made the audit such a pleasant experience.”
Rokt levels up their security program from ISO 27001 to SOC 2
Rokt were already ISO 27001 certified and SOC 2 covers similar controls. However according to Rokt’s VP Cybersecurity, Guido Santo, SOC 2 results in a more granular audit report which customer security teams find more useful.
“Taking things in bite-sized chunks enabled us to action things within the business as we went rather than having a big bang approach.”
livepro achieves security prestige to win large business customers with SOC 2 
 Gaining SOC 2 accreditation was important to livepro's customers, providing security prestige in the market and helping livepro tighten up their operation with reference to best practices. 
Our HQ is in Sydney, Australia. We have team members scattered across Australia and Singapore with plans to expand into the U.S (June) and Europe (Oct) in 2023. We already work with clients in 13 countries, bringing our modern approach to auditing that all works asynchronously so you can complete audits at your pace and in your own way. We jump on calls as needed across timezones to provide personalised service and ensure you're on track to achieving your compliance goals.
We have active clients in 13 countries, including: the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Vietnam, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, India, Slovenia, and the Netherlands.
 We can serve clients in any country with our offering of global standards, subject to language requirements and any country-specific regulations. 
We do not design or implement our clients’ compliance activities. That’s prohibited for audit firms based on the independence requirements of the standards. We do offer tools and guides to help clients understand what is required and provide feedback on their state of compliance. Our audit services are often viewed as management consultancy to guide our clients on their security, compliance, and operations. 
Which regulations and standards does AssuranceLab cover?
We work with clients to issue their attestations, assurance reports, and certifications for: SOC 1, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, CPRA/CCPA, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, Consumer Data Right, CSA STAR Level Two, ESG Reporting, GRI Reporting, and CPS 234. 
We are expecting to add PCI DSS in 2023 and considering HITRUST and the CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS). Our product maps to an additional 12 standards and frameworks including customer specific requirements, NIST and CSC, which are less commonly formally accredited and rather used as guides for your compliance activities. 
We are a CPA and CA audit firm, a certified CSA STAR Auditor, and an ISO certification body, which provides our credentials for the above standards and services. 
Which compliance platforms does AssuranceLab work with?
As an audit firm that needs to retain independence from designing and implementing compliance, we naturally partner with complementary platforms and services companies. Our partners page includes many of these providers. 
Our only security compliance platform partner is Drata. We discontinued formal partnerships with other platforms to maintain our independence against the concerning market trends, and to optimise our audit process for users of Drata’s leading platform that we use ourselves for our own compliance. 
We can provide our audit services to clients using any combination of software products, regardless of our formal partnerships and affiliations.

Bringing trust-building audits within reach at any stage
AssuranceLab was born out of a desire to do audits differently
We founded AssuranceLab to create a new and better way for audits. 
Audits build trust. And that trust is critical to your success. 
Previously, legacy audit practices and price points have kept these benefits from startups and even scaleups. 
Our approach has been proven with companies of all sizes. It just works. For everyone.
See what can be achieved when you inspire trust with 
Win large customers to grow revenue
Equip your team to maintain trust at scale
Work with an audit company that’s on the same page
We use proven and emerging technologies to make traditionally complex, opaque and costly audit processes as simple, transparent and accessible as possible. We offer audits you can enjoy.
No two businesses are the same - so why attempt to standardise audits? Our audits are built around your way of operating, so you get the results you’re seeking without wasting time and money.
We put our team, clients and industry partners at the heart of every decision. We may use the latest in audit and compliance technology but we always make time for people.
Everything we do helps build trust; our service builds trust in us, and our audit services help our clients earn and keep the trust of others. All progress is built on trust.
We get the struggles of fast-moving businesses, but we also know that some barriers to success (like appearing untrustworthy or unreliable to would-be enterprise customers) are avoidable.
We work closely with a range of trusted consulting partners who can help our clients improve in ways we can’t due to potential conflicts. Together we are a total solution.

"When you do audits all at once, you have hours to a few days to provide the evidence because there is a time crunch. I think spreading it out makes it feel like less of a burden for us."
                      Voxel establishes SOC 2 compliance through AssuranceLab’s Drata Starter x Continuous Audit Program and boosts sales efficiency
                     Voxel, a technology-driven SaaS company, leveraged AssuranceLab’s Drata Starter x Continuous Audit Program to achieve their initial compliance outcome in 1 month. By becoming SOC 2 compliant and establishing trust with their large enterprise customers, they were able to noticeably accelerate their sales cycle from months to weeks; all while leveraging fewer resources dedicated to their compliance initiative.
"We found the whole process to become Type 1 SOC 2 and then Type 2 SOC 2 was a complex problem made easy by AssuranceLab. Whenever we had a query about anything the responses were prompt and thoughtful." 
                      Inlogik adds a notch to their belt with SOC 2 to satisfy regulated customers
                     Inlogik manages a broad compliance program spanning SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, PCI-DSS and privacy regulations like GDPR, the APP and OAIC NDB.
                              “The key was in the simplification of the audit requirement. AssuranceLab speaks a language the customer can understand. This is critical.”
                      Plan.Build.Run consultants team up with AssuranceLab for a holistic approach
                     As consultants helping clients implement their compliance, it was important for PBR to team up with auditors to provide the SOC 2 compliance outcomes.
                              "Taking things in bite-sized chunks enabled us to action things within the business as we went rather than having a big bang approach."
                      Livepro achieves security prestige to win large business customers with SOC 2
                     Gaining SOC 2 accreditation was important to livepro's customers, providing security prestige in the market and helping livepro tighten up their operation with reference to best practices. 
“I don’t say this lightly, but we are super stoked that we chose to work with AssuranceLab who have made the audit such a pleasant experience.”
                      Rokt levels up their security program from ISO 27001 to SOC 2
                     Rokt were already ISO 27001 certified and SOC 2 covers similar controls. However according to Rokt's VP Cybersecurity, Guido Santo, SOC 2 results in a more granular audit report which customer security teams find more useful.

"When you do audits all at once, you have hours to a few days to provide the evidence because there is a time crunch. I think spreading it out makes it feel like less of a burden for us."
Voxel establishes SOC 2 compliance through AssuranceLab’s Drata Starter x Continuous Audit Program and boosts sales efficiency
Voxel, a technology-driven SaaS company, leveraged AssuranceLab’s Drata Starter x Continuous Audit Program to achieve their initial compliance outcome in 1 month. 
By becoming SOC 2 compliant and establishing trust with their large enterprise customers, they were able to noticeably accelerate their sales cycle from months to weeks; all while leveraging fewer resources dedicated to their compliance initiative.
Voxel: a cutting-edge computer vision and AI company with a big future
Voxel is a dynamic SaaS company with a sharp focus on enterprise clients. Their customers leverage cutting-edge computer vision and AI technology to automate risk management and provide comprehensive reporting by enabling security cameras to automatically identify hazards and high-risk activities in real-time. Realising the growing need for SOC 2 compliance, Voxel’s Chief Technology Officer, Anurag Kanungo, played a pivotal role in orchestrating their compliance journey with AssuranceLab.
A clear need to accelerate enterprise trust-building and uncap their growth
 first approached AssuranceLab as a fast-growing company seeking to confirm their systems were secure as they grew. In addition, they wanted a surefire way to demonstrate this to their larger customers to build trust and reduce time spent getting through vendor screening questionnaires.
In going to market to secure deals with larger customers, Voxel soon found themselves in what felt like the security and compliance version of 
. Continually stuck in the arduous process of providing information through security questionnaires that seemed to repeat themselves over and over again, the Sales and Engineering teams soon found themselves spending between 10 to 15 hours on each of these efforts.
Knowing there had to be a better way, the Voxel team explored how they could get total control over their entire compliance landscape, in a way that allowed them to automate compliance and easily provide a summary of their security posture to customers.
Pursuing SOC 2: the international standard of choice demonstrating commitment to security and privacy
After further research, the team determined that what they needed was to become SOC 2 compliant. They would need to demonstrate that Voxel had designed and implemented effective controls to ensure the security of customer data.
To supercharge their two-person compliance team to do the work of many, Voxel decided to join forces with a compliance automation platform to help them along this journey. Out of all the compliance platforms currently available, they chose to partner with Drata due to its intuitive and interactive set up that makes obtaining and maintaining security compliance easy.
Once onboarded with Drata, Voxel began their search for an audit partner to assess their controls against the SOC 2 standard. After interviewing a few different companies, their quest for a SOC 2 auditor led them to AssuranceLab, who they felt were the only firm to truly understand them and their processes, as a cloud native, SaaS first company.
Voxel Director of Finance, Kacie Armbrust, shared that Voxel looked at the cost-benefit analysis of becoming compliant. They compared the costs of the audit and Drata with the expedited sales timelines and revenue growth associated with winning larger clients. The choice became clear. Drata and the Continuous Audit Program offered by AssuranceLab was ultimately what Voxel signed up for as it suited their company’s size and needs. 
Voxel had initial concerns around how the partnership would work logistically. With AssuranceLab being based in Australia, they would be working asynchronously with Voxel in the US. These concerns, however, were quickly quelled through the seamless use of Drata’s Audit Hub and a Slack channel for communication between the teams.
Kacie described their onboarding process with AssuranceLab as ‘quick and easy’ noting that combined with Drata, it was an intuitive, fail-safe approach, using the pre-existing systems set up between the two companies.
Finding synergies in partnership and unlocking audit value with minimal strain on internal resources
Going into the audit, the Voxel team had anticipated the need to provide a large amount of evidence to their audit team to meet the requirements of the SOC 2 standard.
After embarking on their journey, they were pleasantly surprised at the reduced volume of manual evidence upload needed due to the synergies created between AssuranceLab and Drata. 
Evidence of Voxel’s controls in Drata were leveraged by AssuranceLab’s auditors, which drastically reduced the amount of time needed for the audit; allowing Voxel to complete their SOC 2 Type 1 report within a month.
Once this was achieved, Voxel were now able to showcase all of their compliance and key security information in Drata’s Trust Centre. This feature puts Voxel in full control of what’s shared and accessible to different types of users.
Drata’s Trust Centre streamlines the process of security reviews for partners and empowers sales teams with self-serve answers to questionnaires, allowing more deals to be secured faster.
They went from needing five different team members' input to complete these questionnaires, down to one; who now had the power to provide all of these self-serve answers at the click of a button. The flow on effect from this was huge and Voxel were able to rapidly accelerate their sales cycle from months to weeks.
Enjoying the benefits of their SOC 2 Type 1 achievement, Voxel found moving into their SOC 2 Type 2 audit to be just as seamless. 
With AssuranceLab’s Continuous Audit Program, the number of controls reviewed across an audit period are broken down into smaller groups or categories, that are then worked on in a logical order month by month.
Completing a SOC 2 Type 2 audit this way drastically reduces the burden that is often felt by companies undergoing this kind of audit, due to the seemingly overwhelming number of controls to cover. By having a small sub-set of controls to work on each month, the workload is spread out into bite-sized chunks, minimising business disruption. 
Reflecting on the experience, Kacie said: “When you do audits all at once, you have hours to a few days to provide the evidence because there is a time crunch. I think spreading it out makes it feel like less of a burden for us.”
“It feels like we're constantly making progress towards it each month, which from an internal perspective is uplifting.” 
A seamless audit process with far-reaching benefits for Voxel and their customer base alike
Overall, Voxel’s partnership with AssuranceLab and their adoption of the Drata Starter x Continuous Audit Program proved transformative for the company. The ongoing, monthly cadence of compliance activities allowed them to make steady progress towards SOC 2 compliance, allaying their concerns about time crunches and year-end audits. 
Voxel’s success story underscores the benefits of proactive compliance management through AssuranceLab’s Drata Starter x Continuous Audit Program. Their improved sales efficiency, enhanced data security, and streamlined audit processes position them for sustainable growth and success in the competitive SaaS landscape.

The three parts of every compliance program
We’ve helped over 200 trailblazers to level up their compliance game
“I don’t say this lightly, but we are super stoked that we chose to work with AssuranceLab who have made the audit such a pleasant experience.”
Rokt levels up their security program from ISO 27001 to SOC 2
Rokt were already ISO 27001 certified and SOC 2 covers similar controls. However according to Rokt’s VP Cybersecurity, Guido Santo, SOC 2 results in a more granular audit report which customer security teams find more useful.
“Taking things in bite-sized chunks enabled us to action things within the business as we went rather than having a big bang approach.”
livepro achieves security prestige to win large business customers with SOC 2 
 Gaining SOC 2 accreditation was important to livepro's customers, providing security prestige in the market and helping livepro tighten up their operation with reference to best practices. 
Our HQ is in Sydney, Australia. We have team members scattered across Australia and Singapore with plans to expand into the U.S (June) and Europe (Oct) in 2023. We already work with clients in 13 countries, bringing our modern approach to auditing that all works asynchronously so you can complete audits at your pace and in your own way. We jump on calls as needed across timezones to provide personalised service and ensure you're on track to achieving your compliance goals.
We have active clients in 13 countries, including: the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, Vietnam, United Kingdom, Ireland, France, India, Slovenia, and the Netherlands.
 We can serve clients in any country with our offering of global standards, subject to language requirements and any country-specific regulations. 
We do not design or implement our clients’ compliance activities. That’s prohibited for audit firms based on the independence requirements of the standards. We do offer tools and guides to help clients understand what is required and provide feedback on their state of compliance. Our audit services are often viewed as management consultancy to guide our clients on their security, compliance, and operations. 
Which regulations and standards does AssuranceLab cover?
We work with clients to issue their attestations, assurance reports, and certifications for: SOC 1, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR, CPRA/CCPA, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, ISO 27017, ISO 27018, Consumer Data Right, CSA STAR Level Two, ESG Reporting, GRI Reporting, and CPS 234. 
We are expecting to add PCI DSS in 2023 and considering HITRUST and the CryptoCurrency Security Standard (CCSS). Our product maps to an additional 12 standards and frameworks including customer specific requirements, NIST and CSC, which are less commonly formally accredited and rather used as guides for your compliance activities. 
We are a CPA and CA audit firm, a certified CSA STAR Auditor, and an ISO certification body, which provides our credentials for the above standards and services. 
Which compliance platforms does AssuranceLab work with?
As an audit firm that needs to retain independence from designing and implementing compliance, we naturally partner with complementary platforms and services companies. Our partners page includes many of these providers. 
Our only security compliance platform partner is Drata. We discontinued formal partnerships with other platforms to maintain our independence against the concerning market trends, and to optimise our audit process for users of Drata’s leading platform that we use ourselves for our own compliance. 
We can provide our audit services to clients using any combination of software products, regardless of our formal partnerships and affiliations.

The ability to achieve a SOC 1 report 
with outstanding issues or process improvements
We built Pillar so you can assess your compliance with 30+ global standards. It helps you get started with a tailored view of your controls and any gaps to prepare for our compliance audits for one or more frameworks. 
We guide you as you address any gaps and implement fit-for-purpose processes that align with your culture and the SOC 1 objectives. Our flexible and responsive team helps you work through it at your own pace.
We conduct the Type 1 audit at your pace to help you minimise disruption and learn through the process. Our iterative reviews and feedback helps you stay on track and achieve real operational benefits for your company.
We conduct the Type 2 audits either at your pace within a defined timeline to suit your preference, or increasingly with our continuous audit practices that conduct the audits in the background throughout the year to minimise disruption and increased confidence in your compliance.
Why are SOC 1 financial reporting objectives relevant to software companies?
The main driver we see for SOC 1 that comes with a financial reporting objective focus, is for publicly listed companies and their associated compliance with Sarbanes Oxley (SOX). That is where publicly listed companies need to prove they have effective internal controls including over critical systems they use. That includes third party software, so your publicly listed customers may ask you for a SOC 1 report covering your software as a service.
What’s the difference between SOC 1 and SOC 2?
The service organisation control, now sometimes referred to as system and organisational control (SOC) standards have been around for decades. Their earlier use was driven by financial reporting objectives, later termed “SOC 1”. That’s where third parties would rely on IT systems or services, and that would impact their financial statement audits or other financial interests like in asset management or superannuation, as examples. 
As reliance on third party services evolved with the software as a service boom, these reports naturally evolved to being used for assurance over those third party services even if there were no direct financial objectives involved. The Trust Services Criteria were then introduced to better align to the modern needs of third parties that were reliant on the security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity and privacy of third party services. This became “SOC 2” to differentiate from the earlier SOC 1 purpose.
What are Type 1 and Type 2 reports?
A Type 1 report attests to your compliance by design. It’s a snapshot in time that can be achieved by showing you have the right systems and processes in place to satisfy the SOC 1 control objectives. 
A Type 2 report attests to your compliance by both design and operation over a period of time. It covers a period between 3-12 months to show your systems and processes have been operated consistently to satisfy the SOC 1 control objectives. 
Usually, a Type 1 report is issued first to baseline compliance. That marks the start of the live and recurring Type 2 audit periods for reports issued annually. That is the industry standard but the SOC standards have flexibility to choose the report dates and periods as desired (usually driven by customers’ expectations that drives that industry standard approach).
Not as such. SOC 1 reports are not pass/fail. The report can be issued with any number of exceptions and qualifications. Most companies choose to delay their issuance of a SOC 1 report until it is “clean”. If you are in an annual reporting cycle with customer commitments, you may not have that flexibility, so the report may be issued with disclaimers about any identified exceptions and qualifications. 
The control objectives in SOC 1 are flexible. They are adapted to specific customer requirements, especially if there are specific financial reporting objectives required to be covered. For a standard SaaS provider scope focused on the technology controls, it includes the following areas as control objectives: 
Can we reduce the audit work by using a compliance platform? 
Yes is the short answer. Unlike ISO 27001, there’s no prescribed audit days, so using automation can help auditors achieve the required level of comfort in your controls in less time. But that relies on an audit firm that’s familiar with the specific platform you’re using and that has an audit approach built for it. It also only works if the controls and scope of the audit are limited to the way the platform works. If you look to have customised controls or diverge from the way the platform works, it can cause additional work for the audit.

              Costs, timeline and what to expect 
Ready to break through with SOC 2?
No, it is an attestation report. It is commonly treated like a certification but there are three key differences: 
You can achieve a SOC 2 report no matter how many issues you have. These may cause exceptions or a qualification, but the report itself is still valid with those disclaimers included. 
Instead of a single page certificate, a SOC 2 report provides details of your compliance scope and processes in a system description. It also includes details of your controls and the auditor’s tests that validated those controls (for Type 2 reports). 
There is no prescribed certification period. For SOC 2 you can choose your reporting dates and periods for your selection of Type 1 and Type 2 reports, as desired to fit your customers’ expectations. 
SOC 2 is often treated like a certification, with accreditation logos to highlight your status of compliance. It may also be used by large enterprise as a pass/fail of meeting their requirements, but by design it can be used more broadly for enterprise due diligence and vendor risk management. 
What is the scope of a SOC 2 report? 
SOC 2 follows a common industry standard when determining the scope. That is, by looking at which services, systems, data, processes, and people are relevant to be secured to protect the customers and other parties that rely on that security. 
This scope is formed by starting with a focus on a specific service. That may be one or more Software-as-a-Service offerings, platform infrastructure, another function as a service, or professional services, as examples. That then cascades down to what systems are used to deliver the service(s), the data that is collected, the people that operate and support it, and the processes to manage the services in a secure manner that covers the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria. 
What are the five Trust Services Criteria categories? 
All SOC 2 reports include the Common Criteria for Security: Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality and Privacy. While Security is always included, the subsequent four areas can be added optionally. 
Security: included in all reports, this covers basic system and data security 
Availability: the reliability and resilience of your systems and services 
Confidentiality: how data is classified, handled, and retained in line with its level of sensitivity 
Processing Integrity: the objectives of your services and how those are managed to ensure complete and accurate data processing 
Privacy: managing personally identifiable data in line with individuals’ privacy rights. 
Security, Availability, and Confidentiality are commonly included to satisfy most enterprise customers’ expectations with minimal additional work on top of the Common Criteria. 
Not as such. SOC 2 reports are not pass/fail. The report can be issued with any number of exceptions and qualifications. Most companies choose to delay their issuance of a SOC 2 report until it is “clean”. If you are in an annual reporting cycle with customer commitments, you may not have that flexibility, so the report may be issued with disclaimers about any identified exceptions and qualifications. 
There are a few things to be aware of that SOC 2 reporting entails: 
There are 33 common criteria to satisfy by mapping your controls and implementing a state of compliance. Our Pillar platform maps this for you, and highlights areas to be fixed to reach compliance. 
The controls include documented policies, system configurations, and defined processes. Our PolicyTree solution generates your tailored set of policies that are the foundations of your compliance program. 
An audit is conducted to verify your compliance, which AssuranceLab performs. We have some flexibility for first time reports, especially Type 1, that lets you fix things as we work through them with you. 
A system description is prepared to overview your compliance scope and activities. We add your tailored controls, mapped to the criteria, and the results of the audit (Type 2); we then both sign off to issue the final report. 
Can we reduce the audit work by using a compliance platform? 
Yes is the short answer. Unlike ISO 27001, there’s no prescribed audit days, so using automation can help auditors achieve the required level of comfort in your controls in less time. But that relies on an audit firm that’s familiar with the specific platform you’re using and that has an audit approach built for it. It also only works if the controls and scope of the audit are limited to the way the platform works. If you look to have customised controls or diverge from the way the platform works, it can cause additional work for the audit. 
What’s the difference between SOC 1 and SOC 2? 
The Service Organisation Control, now sometimes referred to as System and Organisational Control (“SOC”), standards have been around for decades. Their earlier use was driven by financial reporting objectives, later termed “SOC 1”. That’s where third parties would rely on IT systems or services, and that would impact their financial statement audits or other financial interests, like in asset management or superannuation as examples. 
As reliance on third party services evolved with the Software-as-a-Service boom, these reports naturally evolved to being used for assurance over those third party services even if there were no direct financial objectives involved. The Trust Services Criteria were then introduced to better align to the modern needs of third parties that were reliant on the security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity and privacy of third party services. This became “SOC 2” to differentiate from the earlier SOC 1 purpose.
What is a SOC 3 report? What’s required for SOC 3?
SOC 3 is deceptive in the context of what SOC 1 and SOC 2 are. SOC 3 is just a redacted version of a SOC 2 Type 2 report that can be published or more easily shared without the confidential information included in SOC 2 reports. A CPA firm like AssuranceLab issues the SOC 3 report using the relevant information from a SOC 2 Type 2 audit and it is usually issued alongside the SOC 2 Type 2 report. 
What are Type 1 and Type 2 reports?
A Type 1 report attests to your compliance by design. It’s a snapshot in time that can be achieved by showing you have the right systems and processes in place to satisfy the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria. 
A Type 2 report attests to your compliance by both design and operation over a period of time. It covers a period between 3-12 months to show your systems and processes have been operated consistently to satisfy the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria. 
Usually, a Type 1 report is issued first to baseline compliance. That marks the start of the live and recurring Type 2 audit periods for reports issued annually. That is the industry standard but the SOC standards have the flexibility to choose the report dates and periods as desired (usually driven by customers’ expectations, which underlies the industry standard approach).

Audit reports and status letters that keep your customers informed of your progress
An optional assessment for those pursuing ISO 27001 certification for the first-time. We assess your readiness to undergo the following Stage 1 and Stage 2 audits.
Audits your key ISMS documentation from a design standpoint to confirm it satisfies the mandatory requirements of ISO 27001. A report is issued with any non-conformities, process improvements and observations to consider while implementing the remaining ISMS activities.
Audits the complete ISMS against the mandatory requirements and Annex A controls in your Statement of Applicability. A report is issued with any non-conformities, process improvements and observations. Minor non-conformities require a management action plan and agreed timeframe, with up to 90 days given to address prior to the certification decision.
The certification decision is conducted at the mutually agreed date, up to 90 days after the Stage 2 audit is complete. This allows time to remediate any non-conformities that may adversely impact the decision. Upon a successful certification decision, the certification documents are issued.
To ensure ongoing conformity of your ISMS with ISO 27001, surveillance audits are performed for the following two years while the certification remains valid. We follow a risk-based approach to confirming ongoing conformance to the ISO 27001 requirements, by rotating areas of focus and combining with a general assessment of its ongoing operation.
The certification expires in three years. The recertification audit is conducted prior to the expiry to ensure continuous certification. The recertification audits assess the full ISMS mandatory requirements and Annex A controls in the Statement of Applicability.
What is the ISMS and SOA?
The ISO 27001 standard is made up of requirements for operating an effective information security management system (ISMS). That management system needs to be assessed and to adhere to those requirements to achieve certification. Those requirements extend to the implementation of specific information security controls, which can be selected from a prescribed appendix A in the ISO 27001 standard. The controls selected and implemented from that are included in a Statement of Applicability (SoA) to demonstrate how that mix of controls supports the ISMS objectives and forms a key part of meeting the ISMS requirements.
When am I ready for Stage 1?
A Stage 1 audit should be commenced once you’ve implemented the mandatory requirements of the ISO 27001 standard; namely the ISMS. That will give you feedback on how it is set up, to ensure you’re on track for the Stage 2 audit and can address any identified non-conformities prior.
When am I ready for Stage 2?
The Stage 2 should commence once you’ve implemented all controls in the statement of applicability or justified their exclusion. Any major non-conformities from the Stage 1 should have been remediated. You should also complete at least one cycle of the information security management system, including a management review and internal audit.
Major non-conformities are where your ISMS does not meet the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard. That is generally significant gaps in the management system's overall design or the controls in the statement of applicability. In contrast, minor non-conformities may undermine the effectiveness of the ISMS or have a minor impact on the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard but doesn’t prevent it achieving its goals or meeting the key requirements of the ISO 27001 standard.
Can we get certified if we have non-conformities?
Yes, it is possible to get certified with open non-conformities. That will generally only include minor non-conformities that have a clear and reasonable action plan for when and how those non-conformities will be remediated. If there are a high number of minor non-conformities or major non-conformities, you are given up to 90 days to remediate those prior to the certification decision.
How does the three year certification period work?
ISO 27001 follows a 3 year certification cycle. In the first year is the full certification audit. That’s either an initial certification audit when it’s the first time, or a re-certification audit if it’s following a previous 3-year certification cycle. These full certification audits cover all areas of your ISMS and review all controls in your Statement of Applicability. In the following two years, surveillance audits are conducted that are a scaled down audit to review the operation of the ISMS and some areas of the Statement of Applicability.
Can we reduce the audit work by using a compliance platform? 
Yes, and no. ISO 27006 that guides the ISO 27001 standard, prescribes audit days based on the company size and complexity factors. It allows for adjustments of +/- 30% based on that complexity and other factors. A compliance platform with a centralised and well monitored ISMS, is a factor that can reduce the audit days. However, compared to SOC 2 and other audits, the potential reduction in audit time is less significant as it still prescribes a minimum level of effort and duration for the audit days conducted to support certification.

We built Pillar so you can assess your compliance with 30+ global standards. It helps you get started with a tailored view of your controls and any gaps to prepare for our compliance audits for one or more frameworks. 
We guide you as you address any gaps and implement fit-for-purpose processes that align with your culture and the CSA STAR control objectives. Our flexible and responsive team helps you work through it at your own pace.
We conduct the Type 1 audit at your pace to help you minimise disruption and learn through the process. Our iterative reviews and feedback helps you stay on track and achieve real operational benefits for your company. The Type 1 earns your initial CSA STAR Level Two accreditation.
We conduct the Type 2 audits either at your pace within a defined timeline to suit your preference, or increasingly with our continuous audit practices that conduct the audits in the background throughout the year to minimise disruption and increased confidence in your compliance.
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has the Security, Trust, and Risk (STAR) accreditations and register to track three levels of compliance with the cloud controls matrix (CCM). 
The CCM covers 17 domains and 197 control objectives related to best practice cloud security.
What are the three levels of accreditation?
Level One accreditation is based on completing questionnaires to provide information that may or may not have been independently verified into the online CSA register for third party review. Level Two is a certification or attestation report that’s been independently audited and submitted to the CSA. Level Three is a level of continuous assurance for the higher standard of cloud security and third party assurance.
Do I need to do Level One before Level Two?
Yes, but you can do both together. Level One is a completed questionnaire that’s submitted to the CSA registry covering the same details as what’s audited for Level Two accreditation covering the cloud controls matrix. 
Do I need to comply with all 197 control objectives of the CCM?
Yes. You either need to show how your cloud security practices meet each of the 197 objectives, or substantiate why they are not applicable. The number of objectives sounds daunting but there is a lot of overlap in the controls that cover each. We see clients have an average of 220 controls to satisfy the 197 objectives. 
What are Type 1 and Type 2 reports?
A Type 1 report attests to your compliance by design. It’s a snapshot in time that can be achieved by showing you have the right systems and processes in place to satisfy the HIPAA regulatory clauses.
A Type 2 report attests to your compliance by both design and operation over a period of time. It covers a period between 3-12 months to show your systems and processes have been operated consistently to satisfy the HIPAA regulatory clauses.
Usually, a Type 1 report is issued first to baseline compliance. That marks the start of the live and recurring Type 2 audit periods for reports issued annually.
Does CSA STAR replace the need for SOC 2 or ISO 27001?
No. CSA STAR is designed to be complementary. Level Two accreditation conveniently offers pathways through SOC 2 or ISO 27001 so that you can leverage all of your compliance efforts on those more common standards. CSA STAR can be built on top of either SOC 2 or ISO 270001 following either a certification or attestation report approach so that it is compatible with those two global leading standards and the associated audit firm and/or certification body credentials that accredit those standards. 
Can we reduce the audit work by using a compliance platform? 
Yes. Many of the controls required or expected for achieving CSA STAR are supported with automation by security compliance platforms like Drata. AssuranceLab has built the CSA STAR cloud controls matrix and associated controls for the Drata platform that can be imported and continuously monitored for our clients pursuing CSA STAR accreditation.
