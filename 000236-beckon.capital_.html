USE OF COOKIES We use âcookiesâ to help us tailor our website to better suit your needs and to provide a more effective route to various components of our website. We do not store personally identifying information in our cookies. If you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to have access to our website. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your computer's memory and hard drive, in your mobile device or tablet when you visit certain web pages. They are used to enable websites to function or to provide information to the owners of a website or other third parties which receive data obtained from that website. This information might be about you, your preferences or your device and is mostly used to make the site work as you expect it to.
Cookies help us to provide customised services and information. We use cookies to tell us, in general terms, how and when pages in our websites are visited, what our usersâ technology preferences are and whether our website is functioning properly. Depending on their purpose, some cookies will only operate for the length of a single browsing session, while others have a longer life span to ensure that they fulfil their longer-term purposes (as explained in more detail below). Please note that, however long a cookieâs active life may be, you can delete cookies (and therefore stop any further data collection by them) as further described below.
If you are using a password-protected site, then the website may use cookies or other technology to help us authenticate you, store and recognise your configuration and user attributes, facilitate your navigation of the website and customise its content so that the information made available is likely to be of more interest to you.
In broad terms, we may use cookies on our website for the following purposes:
Analytical purposes: Analytical cookies allow us to recognise, measure and track visitors to the website. This helps us to improve and develop the way the website works, for example, by determining whether site visitors can find information easily, or by identifying the aspects of the site that are of the most interest to them.
Usage preferences: Some of the cookies on the website are activated when visitors to our sites make a choice about their usage of the site. Our website then âremembers' the settings preferences of the user concerned.
Terms and conditions: We use cookies on the website to record when a site visitor has seen a policy, such as this one, or provided consent, such as consent to the terms and conditions on our website. This helps to improve the user's experience of the site.
Session management: The software that runs the website uses cookies for technical purposes needed by the internal workings of our servers. For instance, we use cookies to distribute requests among multiple servers, authenticate users and determine what features of the site they can access, verify the origin of requests and keep track of information about a user's session and determine which options or pages to display in order for the site to function.
Functional purposes: Functional purpose cookies store information that is needed by our applications to process and operate. For example, where transactions or requests within an application involve multiple workflow stages, cookies are used to store the information from each stage temporarily, in order to facilitate completion of the overall transaction or request.
Monitoring: Monitoring is also called logging. We track session data in the case of system failure and we may need to use personal data to trace and debug. This will always be done through a token, without identifying the person or company directly in logs.
We may disclose details about the general use of our website to third parties.
You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, notify you when a cookie is set, or delete cookies that have already been set. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

The kind of cookies and the consequent data processing carried out by such third parties are regulated by the third partyâs privacy policy. We do not control the setting of these third-party cookies. You may wish to check any such third partyâs website for more information about their use of cookies and how to manage them.
PROCESS FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT A BREACH OF PRIVACY If you believe that your privacy has been breached, please contact our Privacy Officer using the contact information below and provide details of the incident so that we can investigate it.
We request that complaints about breaches of privacy be made in writing, so we can be sure about the details of the complaint. We will attempt to confirm as appropriate and necessary with you your understanding of the conduct relevant to the complaint and what you expect as an outcome. We will inform you whether we will conduct an investigation, the name, title, and contact details of the investigating officer and the estimated completion date for the investigation process.
After we have completed our enquiries, we will contact you, usually in writing, to advise the outcome and invite a response to our conclusions about the complaint. If we receive a response from you, we will assess it and advise if we have changed our view.

meta title:Beckon Capital is Impact Investing
meta description:We deliver sustainable returns to investors, using capital and capability to help grow SMEs who have positive measurable impacts.

Prosperity is about balance, not strong returns at any cost.
Our investments will offer quality performance because they are in harmony with the needs of people and our planet. We solve local problems by utilising a new SME asset class. 
Register interest as a wholesale investor
Introducing a new asset class, with the objective of delivering income-driven quality returns from SMEs who contribute positive impacts to people and the planet, targeting over 20% annualised return.
Learn more about the new Asset Class 
We build resilient investments by sharing our expertise and innovative approach.
PROVIDING ACCESS TO NEW ASSET CLASSES.
Offering new investment opportunities in real assets, meeting essential needs, and delivering positive returns to investors and communities.
Creating and maximising investment value by working with investees, combining our insights with unconstrained thinking to guide growth.
Measuring external impacts is simply good business practice. Better data encourages better decisions, and proves your investment makes a difference.
Applying good governance, adaptive processes and productivity tools builds resilience in our investments. Capital is only released once agreed milestones are achieved.
Our people are mission driven, straight talkers, working around barriers to move forward. We're investment managers, industry practitioners and technologists.
We combine astute insights, adaptive processes and leading edge technology to assess and strengthen the productivity and value of our investments.
"It's simple. Sustainable and impactful investments equal quality, long term returns."
Our investment offerings will include funds and special purpose vehicles, delivering positive impact and targeting sustainable financial returns in areas such as:
Diversified SMEs contributing to local economies
Businesses contributing to the circular economy
Our funds will be available to Australian wholesale investors only.
Thereâs a problem close to home.
The economy generally isn't geared to help local initiatives which can improve where most of us work, live and play. We feel it, and it's getting worse.
Interest rates are close to zero, making it difficult to earn a return for investors. New investment opportunities are needed. Enterprises and projects meeting local needs can provide reliable financial returns.
There's good value to be found.
Hand-picked SMEs and built environment projects offer better investment value. With the right guidance and capital, there's opportunity to improve productivity and maximise long term return on investment.
Why investing in impact is smart investing.
Impact investments are âmade with the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial returnâ. (The Global Impact Investing Network)
We believe investing in impact businesses and projects is a smart strategy for three very sound reasons:
Itâs simply good business practice supporting risk management
These businesses are more likely to win procurement contracts and grow
Impact reporting shows investors how their capital has made a positive difference
We will work with investees to manage and measure their impact using the 
UN Sustainable Development Goals targets and goals
Introducing impact growth equity, an asset class where positive social and environmental impact drives financial returns. Our investment vehicles (SPVs or fund) will target over 20% annualised returns.
Driving sustainable returns through positive impact
Beckon Investment vehicles aim to offer investors quality returns and the opportunity to contribute to better social and environmental outcomes. We provide growth equity, capital and capability, to Australian SMEs who deliver positive impacts because we strongly believe impact drives sustainable returns.
Expected annualised returns of over 20%
Investing in quality Australian SMEs ready for productivity uplifts
Investment period of around 8 years
Only available to Australian wholesale investors
Investors will see how their capital is making a difference. With access to data-driven reports through an impact dashboard, investors will clearly see the real impacts their investment are achieving.
Beckon Capital partners with investee enterprises to enhance their financial, operational and governance capabilities. Access to relevant data will enhance decision making for enterprises in the Fund, helping improve commercial and impact growth outcomes.
How we reduce risk in our investments.
We combine three proven strategies to reduce risk and maximise value for our investors.
Why? We believe local enterprises and projects that create positive impact aren't just stronger and more resilient, they generate better returns over time.
Working alongside our investees, we understand their business, recommending ways to reduce risk through strategy, governance and capability improvements.
We apply valuable insights and data.
We love data and insights. Our local enterprises and projects use these for better decision making, measuring their performance for continual improvement.

meta title:Growth Equity
meta description:N/A

Beckon Capital is a growth equity focused investment manager. 
Growth equity investment takes a minority shareholding in established businesses of around 20-40% in exchange for capital and resources. Itâs sometimes called expansion capital or growth capital.
Typically, investments are for a longer term of around 8-10 years.
Growth Equity is also known as Patient Capital.
âGrowth equity can be used to accelerate growth, fund acquisitions or offer liquidity to current shareholders.â 
Growth equity is different to venture capital and private equity
Growth equity occupies a middle-ground between traditional early-stage venture capital and private equity. It invests in established enterprises needing capital for:
Resources such as infrastructure, staffing or technologyÂ to support an existing or new business model
Expansion of an enterprise into new market segments or locations
Driving scale and accelerating a growth plan
Venture capital provides funding for markets and business models that arenât yet proven, while private equity funding is typically deployed to acquire entire companies that are more mature.
âVenture Capital investors assume significant market and product risk. In contrast, growth equity investors assume primarily execution and management risk.â 
Designed to create value for both investors and investments, Growth Equity combines capital with capability, providing strategic insights and access to expertise the investment may need to grow. 
The founders are always in control because Growth Equity takes a minority partnership, providing capital and capability to make the business stronger. Small businesses get access to resources usually associated with larger companies such as data, subject experts and innovative tools.
Risk is reduced. Growth equity works alongside the founder, providing insights and guidance to help lift productivity and monitor the progress of achieving agreed strategic milestones.
âGrowth equity offers a modest level of risk, which can be mitigated by the value creation and team development tools that growth equity investors typically employ.â
A funding solution that works for you
Growth Equity can free up SMEs and local built environment projects from the restrictions, pressure and cashflow implications of debt financing; the most common source of funding in these segments. With the right partner, Growth Equity encourages unconstrained thinking to ignite the real potential of a business - and deliver sustainable financial returns.
The UKÂ and Canada are embracing growth equity
Growth Equity is known, used and proven globally but little used in Australia. Beckon is one of Australiaâs earliest fund managers to offer Growth Equity.
The British Growth Fund kicked off in 2011, and the Canadian Growth Fund in 2017. They invest in small to medium-sized enterprises and now boast impressive balance sheets.
The Australian Federal Government established a Business Growth Fund in October 2020.

meta title:Impact Investing
meta description:N/A

Beckon treats impact as an investment strategy designed to deliver more sustainable returns â financially, socially and environmentally. We believe impact drives profit.
So, what does Impact really mean?
Impact means different things to different people. It is not a fad, itâs here to stay. Investing in Impact is a way of sustainably securing our future.
Impact investing is practically evolving DIAGRAM & TEXT MAY NEEDÂ ANÂ UPDATE?
Impact investing started as sacrificing profit to meet a social or environmental need. 
Next, impact investing was treated as a balancing act; delivering profit while doing good things. In fact, this version is defined by The Global Impact Investing Network as ââ¦ the intention to generate positive, measurable social and environmental impact alongside a financial returnâ. 
Beckon has evolved Impact a step further.
We believe that profit through impact delivers sustainable return. Impact and ESGÂ data can help businesses make better decisions, improve product design and report to investors how their money is making a difference.
Impact Investing is doing more than good.
Thereâs a good reason why ESG Funds and impact investing are grabbing the attention of investors.
70% of U.S. sustainable equityÂ fundsÂ ranked in top 50% of their categories
GlobalÂ sustainableÂ fundsÂ pulled in $45.6 billion during Q1 2020Â compared to an outflow of $384.7 billion for the overallÂ fundÂ universe amid the coronavirus pandemic market sell-off
There is no financial tradeoff in the returns of sustainableÂ fundsÂ and traditionalÂ funds
Sustainable funds may offer lower market risk. Sustainable funds experienced a 20% smaller downside deviation than traditional funds, a consistent and statistically significant finding (Morgan Stanley report)
U.S. ESG Funds Outperformed Conventional Funds in 2019
The ESG and impact boom has started
"In the last two years, European investors have switched from non-ESG to ESG funds, selling $7.5bn of the former and buying $4.3bn of the latter."
"ESG accounts for 84% of all equity investments since 2019."
We take a ground-up approach by measuring and managing impact in partnership with our investees.
We work with SMEs to choose their own social and/or environmental goals, using our system to measure and manage their ânet impactâ and assessing the positive outcomes with broader ESG considerations. 
The impact results of all investees are aggregated into an annual fund impact report. 
We use data to show the correlations between impact and financial outcomes of a business model - âreturns through impactâ.
An Impact Story - by Slurrytub
Impact data is a powerful tool for competitive advantage. Our first investment, Slurrytub, demonstrates how.
Slurrytub uses a patented, portable, filtering system to remove slurry from building sites and prevent contamination of waterways and urban environments. 
We worked with Slurrytub to identify and measure their impact, using capital to scientifically test the environmental benefits of their product and get GECA certification.
Slurrytub won its first major contract because of its measurable positive impact. Henley Homes selected Slurrytub to help promote their own environmental credentials to their customers.

Capital and capability are struggling to reach a large part of the economy; ie the local, smaller scale opportunities.Â Â

Beckon Advisory recognises that SMEs (including NFPs) may need their service propositions (projects and initiatives) to be assessed for viability, investability and sustainability. We also recognise the increasing need to measure true social, environmental and financial impact and sustainability.
