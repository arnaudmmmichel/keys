Finding sustainable food on a daily basis. Making ethical easy
I like to start the day with an early morning run on my local beach. It is a great way to get into the day. Unfortunately, over the decades I have been doing this, my run has been peppered with countless pit-stops to collect single-use shopping bags, balloons, plastic straws, styrofoam, and a myriad of discarded household items washed up on the shoreline. It is an extensive, eclectic and occasionally entertaining list but by far the most common and concerning rubbish item I collect is discarded plastic FOOD packaging.
Put simply, with Fair Food Forager customers no longer have to �settle� for over-packaged, wasteful, unethical food, transported halfway around the world simply because they are hungry and time-poor as, here at Fair Food Forager, we are all about Making Ethical Easy!

“We at Balinese Spice Magic really appreciated the platform and recognition that Fair Food Foragers gave us. Fair Food Forager provides a great insight for customers who are looking for businesses who have taken sustainability above high profit. ”
“What an idea! Fair Food Forager helps consumers find organizations like us and that means less waste and resources being used in food. The power of the consumer dollar is underestimated, and I really think this can change the system. They are happy to share our posts and talk about our events, we´ve had customers come through the door and tell us they are visiting from Sydney and saw us on Fair Food Forager. Too good ”
“Fair Food Forager has been great for us, sharing our social media posts and talking about what we are doing. They even interviewed us when we got our composter. I think the platform is amazing, and their plans for the future should really help business achieve more sustainability. I can see a time in the future where food culture and where it comes from becomes just important as taste or cost ”
