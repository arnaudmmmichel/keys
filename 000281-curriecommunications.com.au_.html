                                            Currie’s capacity to provide the support we needed combined with their industry knowledge and experience made it easy for them to not only work closely with us but to connect with our growers and industry base.

                                            Currie have been invaluable through the development of the Australian Beef Sustainability Framework. It’s refreshing to work with an agency that genuinely has a deep understanding of sustainability and the complexities that come with it. This in combination with their broad networks and a passion for stakeholder engagement have been the perfect fit for this project.

                                            Currie’s work on communications and engagement has been crucial in obtaining stakeholder agreement for a national sustainability framework for the Australian dairy industry. I have no hesitation in recommending them.                     
Manager Sustainability including Food Safety & Integrity, Dairy Australia
                                            Currie ensured they had a thorough understanding of the project needs and the culture of the organisation in shaping their approach. They maintained professionalism and attention to detail throughout, and their diligence and effective stakeholder engagement has resulted in a clear, comprehensive plan. All in all they helped us achieve a great outcome and were a pleasure to work with.

                                            Currie is an outstanding company. Their team and their approach are highly professional. They are responsive in all their dealings – both with people and the tasks at hand.

At Currie, we see the possible
For 30 years we have connected clients and stakeholders in conversations about a better way forward. But, we are not the heroes of this story. The leaders we work with are – the ones who aren’t afraid to start difficult conversations about complex challenges we need to solve together.
Currie works at the nexus between food production, natural resource management, and programs that support people and community.
Currie is a proudly certified B Corporation and a participant in the United Nations Global Compact.
We see a world with leaders working towards a kinder, fairer, safer future for all.
A future that connects people with food, land and water, and, ultimately, with one another.
To give voice to people and organisations that sustain life on our planet.
Currie partners with others to make a positive impact on the world. This includes pro bono clients, to whom we gift 5% of our consulting time each year. These partnerships empower people to feed themselves, protect nature and live better, and enable organisations to work in a way that sustains life and realises a better tomorrow.
Not everything that matters is easily measured, yet Currie manages its material sustainability impacts in three ways. We use B Lab’s B Impact Assessment to monitor social and environmental outcomes. We report progress on our commitment to the UN Global Compact. We report these impacts in a sustainability report.
