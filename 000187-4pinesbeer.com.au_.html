Cape Jervis Tree Planting | 4 Pines Beer
44 444 native trees, shrubs & ground covers have now been planted!
Flashback to the ‚Äô21-‚Äò22 Summer of Cricket & you may recall having seen the Australian Men‚Äôs Test Captain Pat Cummins in a 4 Pines Brewing Co. community service announcement, promising to plant 4 trees for every 4 hit during the Summer Of Cricket. We‚Äôre proud to announce we went a bit further than that, and recently planted 44,444 trees, plants, and shrubs at Cape Jervis on South Australia‚Äôs Fleurieu Peninsula in partnership with Landcare Australia and 1% For the Planet. The planting is very timely given we are currently celebrating National Landcare Week.
This strategic location will enhance landscape connectivity, improve biodiversity & provide long term habitat for threatened species including the Glossy Black Cockatoo. The large area spanning 40 hectares (or just under 100 acres), was seeded with carefully selected species native to the Cape Jervis area and a ceremonial planting of 1000 shrubs was held with a local community group, Landcare Australia staff & some of the team from 4 Pines.
Over time much of the native vegetation along the South Australian Coastline has been removed, so the Glossy Black Cockatoo which was once endemic to the South Australian Coastline retreated to Kangaroo Island. The species was on the brink of becoming extinct with just 200 Glossy Blacks remaining, so a concerted effort was made to save them, and numbers now sit at 600. By planting their main food source of Drooping Sheoak Trees & understory plants to create natural habitat for the Glossy Black, we hope to encourage the species to migrate back to the mainland.¬†
Through donating 1% of all sales revenue from our Pacific Ale, Pale Ale, Extra Refreshing Ale & most recently Ultra Low to 1% For the Planet, we are proud to have partnered with Landcare Australia to support biodiversity and sustainable outcomes for Australian communities. We look forward to this continued relationship & supporting more Aussie wildlife in the years to come.

4 Pines x Sea Forest - Good Beer that Gives Back -  Why Is There Seaweed In My Beer? | 4 Pines Beer
THIS IS A TALE OF COWS, BEER, SEAWEED, METHANE & GLOBAL WARMING. HOW ON EARTH DO ALL THESE RELATE?
IT ALL STARTED WITH TWO PLANET LOVIN‚Äô COMPANIES‚Ä¶
A company cultivating solutions to climate change
A brewing company looking to develop a good beer that gives back
The Sea Forest team is dedicated to fighting climate change by being the first in the world to cultivate Asparagopsis at a commercial scale.
Who are these pine tree lovers?
Who are these pine tree lovers?
4 Pines is a brewery based in the Northern Beaches of Sydney in NSW. The brand was born following a post-surf chat between Jaron and his dad Steve. This was back in ‚Äô06. A whole lot has happened since we first opened our microbrewery in Manly, but some things will never change. We continue to make quality, award winning beers that we want to drink and that our mates are proud of. Our commitment to using business as a force for good is as strong today as it was in the beginning, we‚Äôre on a continuous journey to Brew Better, considering our people, our planet & our community.
Asparagopsis is a red seaweed native to Australian Coastal waters. Through photosynthesis it captures carbon from the atmosphere which makes up 40% of its biomass. Sea Forest is the first in the world to cultivate Asparagopsis at a commercial scale through both marine and land-based aquaculture.
Why on earth is there seaweed in my beer?
Why on earth is there seaweed in my beer?
We‚Äôve added Seaweed to this tassie inspired brew in celebration of all the amazing work conducted by Sea Forest and the Sea Forest Foundation. There is about 1kg of Nori added to every brew. We add it on the hot side during the boil to extract salts and sweetness and to impart some umami flavour.¬†
Want to get down with the science?
Want to get down with the science?
In response to climate change Sea Forest have developed a methane busting, biotechnology that could help save the world! ¬†Using native seaweed ‚ÄòAsparagopsis‚Äô, Sea Forest have developed a cattle feed supplement, SeaFeedTM. Extensive research has shown that SeaFeedTM when fed daily to cattle at a very low dose, much like taking a vitamin c tablet, prevents the formation of methane in the final stage of digestion and in doing so diverts that energy which would have been expelled as a gas towards making more nutrients available to the animal.
Livestock whose diets contain 0.2% of ¬†SeaFeedTM ¬†supplement, will have methane reductions of up to 98%. Around 15% of global greenhouse emissions come from livestock production.¬†
So where do I get my hands on it? 
So where do I get my hands on it? 
So as not to influence a nation wide sushi shortage, we've produced a very limited amount of tins. This brew is here today and there's every chance it'll be gone tomorrow.¬†
You can find it now at Dan Murphy‚Äôs and select BWS outlets as well as 4 Pines venues.
Get in while you still can!¬†
Sea Forest have teamed up with the University of Tasmania‚Äôs Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) to create the Sea Forest Foundation, specifically to protect and restore local marine habitats like the giant kelp forests. The kelp forests are a vital part of the Tasmanian marine ecosystem as well as the great southern reef and create underwater forests that are home to hundreds of other unique species.

Due to climate change - specifically, rising sea temperatures, low nutrient conditions and increasing numbers of sea urchins ‚Äì over 95% of the giant kelp forests in Tasmania have perished. Without intervention, they won‚Äôt recover.¬†
The Sea Forest Foundation and IMAS are embarking on the first ever forest-scale kelp restoration project in the southern hemisphere. Together, our goal is to create a natural and self-supporting giant kelp forest in Tasmania.
Methane is produced in the guts of ruminant livestock as a result of enteric fermentation.
Sea Forest‚Äôs Asparagopsis feed supplement contains bioactive compounds which prevent methane production in ruminant livestock. This is achieved by competitively inhibiting the enzymatic pathway which produces methane at the last stage of digestion.
Methane has a global warming effect 28 times that of CO2, causing livestock to contribute 16% of global greenhouse emissions.
Animals whose diets contain 0.2% Sea Forest‚Äôs supplement will have methane reductions up to 98%.

THE REAL MAGIC HAPPENS WHEN THESE COMPANIES JOIN FORCES
