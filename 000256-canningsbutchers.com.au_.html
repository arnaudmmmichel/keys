How to Make Your Own Compound Butter
Two words that will change your life: compound butter. Deceptively simple to make, with endless possible flavour combinations, compound butter is an amazing way to jazz up everything from steak to chicken breast.
Thanks to the legends at Grown & Gathered (Matt and Lentil) for letting us feature their wonderful recipe here. This recipe pairs perfectly with Matt and Lentil's delicious organic wines from Minimum Wines - now on shelves at Cannings.
We highly recommend this with a Minimum Wines white, such as the Colossus of Harry (2022 sauv blanc).
