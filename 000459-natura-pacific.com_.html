Since 2016 Natura Pacific and TAFE Queensland have worked closely together, with a number of supporting partners including Lendlease Communities, to trial an inclusive project that provides certified education to prisoners at local correctional facilities whilst educating school children on conservation and producing tangible outcomes for environmental rehabilitation and community engagement. The Natura Pacific environmental consulting team facilitates native seed harvesting that is delivered to local correctional facilities to be propagated and cared for by prisoners attaining certifications through TAFE Queensland. The Natura Pacific education team then facilitates planting days with schools and community groups to assist conservation efforts across South-East Queensland.

Get involved in conservation events and education happening in your area. Here are a few things coming up.
The Glossy Black Conservancy, in partnership with Birdlife Australia is holding Australia’s first Great Glossy Count on Saturday 26 March, 2022.
The South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo is at risk of population decline after losing many of its feed trees in the devastating bushfires of 2019-2020.
Data collected during the Great Glossy Count will support vital bushfire recovery and conservation work by informing habitat management for these birds.
But we need your help! We’re seeking volunteer citizen scientists in Queensland, New South Wales, ACT, and Victoria to help survey the South-eastern Glossy Black-Cockatoo on Saturday 26 March 2022.
As a citizen scientist, you’ll have the opportunity to participate in training to hone your bird and feed tree identification skills, and then collect data that is critical for supporting the recovery of Glossy Black-Cockatoos.

Students will understand the importance of water bugs as environmental indicators and how we can improve the health of our waterways
Students will dig deep down into Mini Beasts and Life in the Undergrowth! This lesson will give students the ‘hands on’ opportunity to explore a variety of topics including features, basic needs, food chains and more. Students will understand that changes to the environment may have positive and negative impacts on insect populations which can in turn have impacts on the environment.
Students will get into nature and have the ‘hands on’ opportunity to investigate living things, what they need to survive, their parts and how they respond to seasonal and weather changes.

An interactive and hands-on workshop to inspire and teach children all about composting, organic gardening and worm farming. Each child will make their own mini compost as well as create a special hand-made pot. This will be planted to become their very own mini garden to take home and share with their families.
This workshop is all about the importance of reuse in a fun and creative way! Children reuse items from nature and from the household to create works of art and learn all about the importance of recycling in the process.
Mini beasts galore! The children will get up close and personal with bugs from land and water while learning all about the way they live their lives and what they need to survive. This is an engaging way to connect children with the creatures that are living all around us and how important it is to care for the environment in which we all live.
