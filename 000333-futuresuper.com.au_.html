How We Invest | Future Super
Your super is supposed to invest and grow your retirement savings, to
      prepare you for the future. But super funds still invest money in harmful
      industries like fossil fuels, that endanger your future and worsen climate
      change. We invest your super for your financial future and for the quality
      of your future. We do this by applying our theory of change to a
        investments with harmful impacts on people or the planet.
We have developed an investment strategy that reflects the reasons people
In addition to investing for your financial benefit, we aim to create
      systemic change through investment, by harnessing the power of your super
      to build a future without climate change or inequality.
Investing for a fossil fuel free future. What does this mean?
Fossil fuels are hydrocarbon containing materials of biological origin
      occurring within the Earth’s crust and which can be used as a source of
      energy. This is coal, oil and gas. Future Super sets a 0% threshold for
      direct exposure to fossil fuel companies in our investments, meaning all
      companies and investments identified as owning fossil fuel reserves and/or
      engaged in the mining, extraction or burning of fossil fuels are screened
We regularly review our portfolio to ensure compliance to our ethical
      screens. Should we identify that an asset we hold changes the nature of
      their business so that they no longer meet our standards, we will remove
      that asset from our portfolio. Please see the
      for more information on how we invest your money.
Our actions as an investor have consequences for your community and
      planet, and we use three core strategies to pave the way toward a more
We use a negative screening process (divestment) to protect you from
      exposure to unsustainable assets. Our screening removes harmful
      investments that pose risks to your super and your future from our
      investment universe, and directs the flow of capital elsewhere.
Divestment is one of our greatest tools to change systems, challenging the
      social licence of industries like fossil fuels and pressuring other
      investors to reject them. This process screens out fossil fuels from our
      portfolio, including companies and assets that provide services to the
      fossil fuel industry, like finance and transportation. We believe that’s a
      smart investment strategy because, as the world works to limit global
      warming to 1.5 degrees, most fossil fuel companies will likely be worth
It’s not just about what you do, it’s also what you don’t.
We use reinvestment as a mechanism to create impactful super products by
      redirecting divested money into more sustainable investments and in impact
We seek to identify investment products that avoid or reduce harm, and
      when these don’t exist, we partner with like-minded investors to create
      them. We also seek to invest some of our capital in impact investments,
      which directly address climate change or inequality. This realises the
While we do our best to invest responsibly, no company is perfect. We use
      tools like voting and engagement to push the companies we invest in to
      improve things like their climate impact or supply chains.
Future Super actively engages with the companies we invest in and our
      industry on important issues (both individually and in collaboration with
      other investors). In addition, we also advise our investment partners on
      how to vote on shareholders resolutions at company Annual General Meetings
Key points to our investment approach
Protect members from the stranded asset risk of fossil fuels.
Reduce long term risk by investing in assets with superior environmental,
Invest in assets that achieve financial outperformance for our members while

      like Telstra. We don’t expect every investment to change the world, but we
      do make all of our investments public so that you can see where your money

Can I just switch all my super to cash while markets are volatile? 
Future Super doesn’t have a cash option, but many other funds do. During the market volatility around the start of the pandemic some people did choose to switch to cash. Unfortunately, research found that members in the averaged super balanced option who switched to cash in April 2020 would have lost up to 27% by July 2021.
We do allocate a portion of the portfolio to cash, and in certain situations the investment team could choose to allocate more to cash if it deems that as the most appropriate action.
If you’re considering options for your super, we recommend you seek personal financial advice before making a decision.
Has Future Super changed its investment strategy given the negative returns?
No strategic changes have been made as a result of recent negative returns and higher volatility in share markets. Future Super takes a rules-based approach to investment, which aims to deliver results over a longer term time horizon.
We continue to believe it is possible to invest in a way that has a positive impact on the world, and with ethics in mind, while also providing for our members’ retirements. 
After the surge in fossil fuel prices in 2022, there was some debate in the media about whether super funds could deliver great returns for members and act on climate change. 
Super is a long term investment. It’s designed to see you through your whole working life and into retirement. At Future Super, we believe the threat of climate change should be front of mind in our long-term investment thinking. We also believe in investing in a future that is worth retiring into.
Our screening work to protect you from harmful assets remains consistent, but this year it’s given us a performance edge. Thanks to our screens, we’ve been more heavily invested in the sectors that have performed the strongest this past financial year.
We screen out many of the big banks, locally and internationally, because they fund fossil fuel projects. And recently, performance for bank stocks has been held back by recession fears.
Utilities (like energy companies) were one of the weakest performing sectors globally*. Future Super’s screening approach paid off here too as we deliberately avoid investing in the vast majority of utilities companies due to their reliance on fossil fuels. 
This sector based advantage in our portfolio was backed up by earlier decisions to move some of our income assets into being inflation linked (known as floating rate). These are the sorts of decisions our investment team makes by constantly monitoring the markets on your behalf.
We want to invest for a better future - for the world and for our members. What these positive returns show is the power of doing both at the same time.

All information provided is general in nature only and does not take into consideration your personal objectives, financial situation or needs. Please read the relevant Product Disclosure Statement, Target Market Determination and Financial Services Guide available at 
 and consider whether Future Super is appropriate for your needs before investing. We recommend you seek independent personal financial advice before investing.
Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.
If it's normal for performance to go up and down, why haven't I seen my super fund's performance go down before?
FY22 was Future Super’s first year of negative returns since we launched in 2014.*
Even if you haven’t been with Future Super for a long period of time, whether you’ve seen your super returns go down before probably depends on how long you’ve have had a super fund for and how often you’ve looked at your balance.
The Australian and US share markets enjoyed a very buoyant period, where it was pretty rare for markets to be down by much,** from 2009 until the pandemic in 2020. It’s actually historically rare for markets to be so consistently up, and some experts consider that period the “longest bull market in history”. Between Australian shares and US shares, that’s a decent chunk of most super funds’ balanced options.*** That could be why you haven’t noticed a dip in returns before. But again, it’s so important to keep that long term perspective in mind.

We’re keeping your money away from fossil fuel companies that are contributing to catastrophic climate change. By being a Future Super member, you are part of the divestment movement - a movement of investors using money for good and investing in a way that seeks to reduce climate change and inequality.
We invest in all different types of assets with superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations. To give you an example, we have invested in the IIG Solar Asset Fund, a renewable energy investment that owns three large-scale solar farms - Swan Hill, Chinchilla and Brigalow.  Those solar assets are an example of investing in assets that aim to contribute to our overall performance while at the same time building clean energy solutions.*

What does Future Super invest in? 
When we launched in 2014, Future Super was the first super fund to not invest in fossil fuel companies and remains the only super fund to screen out diversified fossil fuel companies and companies providing significant services and financing to the fossil fuel industry.
At Future Super we use a three-step process to ensure your money is invested in companies that can both grow your super savings and build a better world. You can see our 
First, out with the bad: our negative screen rules out harmful and destructive industries like fossil fuels, detention centres, live animal export, nuclear, tobacco and more.
Second, in with the good: our positive screen ensures we actively seek out companies that are doing social and environmental good, such as renewable energy, healthcare, education and IT. You can view a full list of the companies we invest in 
Finally, our team look for positive industries like solar farms and other impact investments to add to the portfolio. Our renewable energy portfolio includes the Bald Hills Wind Farm in Victoria and the Lake Bonney battery in South Australia.

 section for other information your employer may need.
Why is my account performance different to the fund performance? 
Your personal investment performance may differ to the fund performance depending on 
 money was contributed to your account, or deducted from your account, over the course of the year.
How does a unitised fund work?
Future Super is a unitised fund, which means that every time a contribution is made into your account, you are issued units in your chosen investment option. This also means that when you are paid a benefit or money is deducted from your account (for example, for fees or insurance premiums), a portion of your unit holdings are sold.
Your balance is therefore calculated as the number of units you hold multiplied by the unit price on any particular day.
The unit price for all members of the fund (the value of a unit) is calculated every week day and changes based on the value of the assets the fund invests in, as well as the fees and taxes that are due and deducted from the value of the assets.
As the unit price fluctuates so too will your balance. This is because your balance is calculated as the number of units you hold multiplied by the unit price on any particular day.
What were the total returns of my investments in the past financial year?
You can find your total investment earnings on the front page of your member statement under 
. Please note that your investment earnings shown are net earnings after all fees and taxes.
You will also find the net earning rate of return under the 
 section. Your personal investment performance may differ to the fund performance depending on 
 you contributed or withdrew over the financial year.
, which will differ based on which investment option you have chosen and is included as part of the unit price calculation. This includes the investment fee, percentage-based administration fee and indirect cost ratios. These are referred to as 
fees and costs deducted from your investment
 in your annual member statement. These do not show in your transaction history.

fees deducted directly from your account
You can find the total fees for each investment option outlined on the 
A detailed breakdown of the different fees incurred by each of our investment options is available on pages 26- 30 of our 
Please note the flat rate dollar-based administration fee is only charged to members with account balances of over $6000.
Why is the total fees amount in my member statement different to the fees shown in deductions?
The investment fee, percentage-based administration fee and indirect cost ratios are accrued and reflected in the unit price when the unit price is calculated, and paid in arrears. These fees are not deducted directly from your account.
The deductions listed on the first page of your member statement include the fees and costs that have been deducted directly from your account, including contributions tax and the flat dollar-based administration fee (applicable  for balances over $6,000).
Why did I receive a fee rebate?
Under the Protecting Your Super legislation, accounts with a balance under $6,000 have a 3% fee cap. In order to comply with this legislation, the flat (dollar-based) administration fee is waived for accounts with balances under $6,000.
However, this fee cap is assessed at a particular point in time (for example, at the end of the financial year, on the 30th of June, or on your account’s date of exit). This means that, if your account balance moved over the $6,000 threshold over the course of the financial year but then fell back under the $6,000 threshold, fees may have been charged on the higher balance during the year and the 3% fee cap will have been exceeded. Therefore, a rebate was paid to your account to ensure that we did not overcharge fees.
Do I need my annual member statement to complete my tax return?
If you need confirmation that your personal contributions and your Notice of intent to claim a deduction for personal contributions has been applied to your account, you should be able to use your 
 . Your Letter of Acknowledgement should be sent to your 5 business days after your Notice of intent has been processed.

 or over the phone on 1300 658 422.
If you have withdrawn funds from your account, your benefits may be subject to tax and you should have received a Payment Summary for this
Preserved benefits include all contributions made by you or on your behalf since 30th of June 1999 and the investment returns gained from these contributions.
Examples of contributions include employer super guarantee payments, or personal contributions.
Preserved benefits cannot be accessed unless a condition of release is met.
What does restricted non-preserved benefit mean? 
Restricted non-preserved benefits refer to employment-related contributions (other than employer contributions) made before 1 July 1999.
You can’t access this type of benefit until the related employment arrangement has been terminated.
What does unrestricted non-preserved benefit mean?
Unrestricted non-preserved benefits are the portion of your funds that you can access, as you have already met 
 to access your super. These benefits can be paid to you at any time.
Typically, retired members who have chosen to leave money in their super fund will have this type of benefit.
Why is the preserved benefit amount on my member statement different from the balance shown in my online account?
The Annual Member Statement shows the balance of your account as at the 30 June of the previous financial year. This would be different to the account balance displayed currently online which would be calculated based on the latest unit price.
Your closing balance at the end of the financial year may also include some non-preserved benefit, which is dependent on your circumstances.
Where do I find my insurance information?
You can find out about the insurance coverage you hold on page 2 of your Annual Member Statement, under the heading “Your insurance cover”.
Additionally, you can find more information about the insurance coverage you hold by logging into your 
t and clicking the Insurance tab.
If you would like to learn more about applying for insurance coverage, please see our 
 or get in touch with us at 
What are the numbers next to my name on my annual member statement?
The numbers next to your name are numbers used to identify you and your account. Next to your name you should find your member number followed by your account number. This will appear in the format ‘MMBRXX-ACCTXX’ and may have the prefix ‘FS’.
What is the tax paid on my account? 
The super contributions paid to your account from your income before tax are taxed at 15% and called ‘concessional’ contributions. This can include employer contributions, such as compulsory employer contributions (employer super guarantee contributions) and salary sacrifice payments made to your super fund, as well as personal contributions for which you have notified us you are intending to claim a tax deduction.
What are the benefits paid in my account? 
“Benefits Paid” (listed within the “What has been deducted from your account” section of your member statement) refers to the total amount that has been withdrawn from your super account during the financial year.
How do I know if my employer paid enough super?
In the 2022-23 financial year, the super guarantee rate that your employer was obligated to pay was 10.50% of your annual income.
Note, effective from 1 July 2023, the super guarantee rate is now 11%.
You can review the total contribution amount that your employer has paid into your account on the first page of your annual member statement.
Superannuation is a compulsory government scheme to help you save for retirement. Your employer pays mandated contributions to your super and you can also contribute funds to it yourself if you wish to. This money is then invested on your behalf by your super fund.
One of the benefits of super is that it is designed to be a tax-effective way to save for your retirement, with contributions and investment earnings in your super fund typically taxed at a lower rate than your normal earnings. Super is saved for your retirement and can be accessed when a 
Can I choose my super fund?
Most people have the option of choosing their own super fund. All you need to do is 
provide your employer with the details of your preferred super fund
. If you don’t specify a super fund, your employer will likely create an account for you with their default super fund.
A small number of people are not eligible to choose their super fund, due to Enterprise Agreements with industry funds. You will need to speak to your employer to find out if this is your situation.

Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.
Has Future Super changed its investment strategy given the negative returns?
No strategic changes have been made as a result of recent negative returns and higher volatility in share markets. Future Super takes a rules-based approach to investment, which aims to deliver results over a longer term time horizon.
We continue to believe it is possible to invest in a way that has a positive impact on the world, and with ethics in mind, while also providing for our members’ retirements. 
After the surge in fossil fuel prices in 2022, there was some debate in the media about whether super funds could deliver great returns for members and act on climate change. 
Super is a long term investment. It’s designed to see you through your whole working life and into retirement. At Future Super, we believe the threat of climate change should be front of mind in our long-term investment thinking. We also believe in investing in a future that is worth retiring into.
Our screening work to protect you from harmful assets remains consistent, but this year it’s given us a performance edge. Thanks to our screens, we’ve been more heavily invested in the sectors that have performed the strongest this past financial year.
We screen out many of the big banks, locally and internationally, because they fund fossil fuel projects. And recently, performance for bank stocks has been held back by recession fears.
Utilities (like energy companies) were one of the weakest performing sectors globally*. Future Super’s screening approach paid off here too as we deliberately avoid investing in the vast majority of utilities companies due to their reliance on fossil fuels. 
This sector based advantage in our portfolio was backed up by earlier decisions to move some of our income assets into being inflation linked (known as floating rate). These are the sorts of decisions our investment team makes by constantly monitoring the markets on your behalf.
We want to invest for a better future - for the world and for our members. What these positive returns show is the power of doing both at the same time.

Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.
If it's normal for performance to go up and down, why haven't I seen my super fund's performance go down before?
FY22 was Future Super’s first year of negative returns since we launched in 2014.*
Even if you haven’t been with Future Super for a long period of time, whether you’ve seen your super returns go down before probably depends on how long you’ve have had a super fund for and how often you’ve looked at your balance.
The Australian and US share markets enjoyed a very buoyant period, where it was pretty rare for markets to be down by much,** from 2009 until the pandemic in 2020. It’s actually historically rare for markets to be so consistently up, and some experts consider that period the “longest bull market in history”. Between Australian shares and US shares, that’s a decent chunk of most super funds’ balanced options.*** That could be why you haven’t noticed a dip in returns before.

Can I just switch all my super to cash while markets are volatile? 
Future Super doesn’t have a cash option, but many other funds do. During the market volatility around the start of the pandemic some people did choose to switch to cash. Unfortunately, research found that members in the averaged super balanced option who switched to cash in April 2020 would have lost up to 27% by July 2021.
We do allocate a portion of the portfolio to cash, and in certain situations the investment team could choose to allocate more to cash if it deems that as the most appropriate action.
If you’re considering options for your super, we recommend you seek personal financial advice before making a decision.
We’re keeping your money away from fossil fuel companies that are contributing to catastrophic climate change. By being a Future Super member, you are part of the divestment movement - a movement of investors using money for good and investing in a way that seeks to reduce climate change and inequality.
We invest in all different types of assets with superior environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations.

Put simply, divestment is the opposite of investment. It is the act of selling assets for moral, political or financial reasons.
Divestment is an effective tactic for influencing positive change. Famous examples include divestment from South Africa in the former era of apartheid, divestment of the Arms Trade, and Tobacco industry divestment.
Future Super is part of the fossil fuel divestment movement. Fossil fuel divestment is the process of selling off assets in companies that mine, process or burn fossil fuels. Future Super has also divested from companies that provide finance or services to the fossil fuel industry, such as Australia’s big four banks.
The fossil fuel divestment movement is dedicated to moving out of fossil fuel companies. This undermines the social licence of the industry by telling them that they are no longer welcome to continue operating.
As well as individuals divesting their personal finances, many different organisations have also committed to divest. These include universities, churches, city councils, philanthropic organisations, insurance companies, and huge sovereign wealth funds.
Find out more about the fossil free movement here at 
Divestment serves two purposes. Firstly, divestment delegitimises those businesses that use the power of money to cause harm. For example, in countries where the fossil fuel industry has a firm hold on all parts of society (through political lobbying, the funding of policy think tanks, etc.), divestment erodes the industry’s dominance and creates the space needed for change to happen.
Secondly, divestment is most effective when coupled with 
 At Future Super, it is our mission to ensure that our members’ money is building a future worth retiring into. By allowing our members to invest in line with their values, Future Super aims to fast track the transition away from coal and into a future free from climate change and inequality.
Aside from fossil fuels, what other ethical screens does Future Super have?
We take a holistic approach to investing that covers a wide range of ethical issues. We do not invest in companies or activities that cause social or environmental harm, such as detention centres, live animal export, tobacco, and armaments, to name a few. This is known as ‘negatively screening’ companies.
Further to this, we also seek out positive investments in industries that provide benefits for the environment, society and the economy. These investments include renewable energy and energy efficiency, water and resource conservation, healthcare, education, electric transport, green infrastructure and more. This is called ‘positive screening.’
Money is powerful, and we believe that applying both negative and positive ethical screens to the assets we consider investing in will provide us with an investment portfolio that will build a world free from climate change and inequality.

Please note, if you choose to transfer your whole balance, this will automatically close your old account as well as any insurance policy or other benefits attached to it. You should consider this before making a decision to rollover.

The above information is general information only and does not take into account any person’s financial objectives, situation or needs. We recommend that you seek professional financial advice tailored to your own personal circumstances before deciding to rollover to Future Super.
How to roll over your existing super through myGov
You can transfer any ATO held super you have, as well as your old super funds via your MyGov account. Here’s how to do it:
Open the Australian Taxation Office page under 
 (If you haven’t linked your ATO account then you’ll need to do this first).
A list of your funds including ATO held super with their last reported balances* will show up. Select the accounts you’d like to transfer from and the account you’d like to transfer to (i.e. from ABC super to Future Super)
* There will be an ‘as at’ or ‘effective’ date for the balance shown. In a lot of cases, it will be 30 June of the last financial year as funds are only required to report to the ATO once a year. This means your actual account balance may have changed since it was last reported to the ATO, and may be higher or lower than shown in your myGov account. Performing a rollover using myGov will transfer the actual full balance in the account as at the date of rollover request.
Please note that rolling your whole balance over to Future Super will close your other super account and cancel any insurance that you hold through this account.
We’ll take care of the rest! Rollovers from other funds usually takes 3–7 business days to process. However, please note that processing times to roll over ATO held super varies and is subject to the ATO’s timeframes.

Baby Bump is a refund of the annual dollar-based administration fee for the time you are on parental leave, up to a maximum of 12 months (equivalent to $60).
We created Baby Bump for two reasons:
Employers don’t have to pay super when you take parental leave, and
Primary carers (who are historically mostly women) are more likely to take parental leave than other carers.
These two factors contribute to the startling gender inequality in super - that, on average, women retire with 42%* less super than men. So Baby Bump is Future Super’s baby step towards making super more fair for our members.
You don’t have to be the birth parent to take advantage of our Baby Bump policy however. If you have welcomed a new child into your family and taken parental leave or left work to care for that child, you can apply for the Baby Bump regardless of your gender.
For more information on eligibility and how to apply please see this 
I’m on parental leave. What support do you provide? 
Future Super supports those on parental leave through a program called Baby Bump. Baby Bump is a refund of all or part of the annual dollar-based administration fee for the time you’re on parental leave or have left work, up to a maximum of 12 months ($60).

How do I find out if Protecting Your Super impacts me?
For your account to be affected under Protecting Your Super, the following criteria would need to be met:
Your whole account balance must be less than $6,000 at the time of reporting;
You have not received an amount for crediting into your account (such as rollovers or contributions) within the last 16 months;
You have not satisfied a prescribed condition of release;
There is no insurance on the account;
You have not amended your insurance cover in the past 16 months;
You have not made or amended a binding nomination of beneficiaries.
What classifies an Inactive low balance account (ILBA):
An Inactive low balance account is essentially a super account with a balance below $6,000 and none of the actions as stated in the above section have occurred in the past 16 months. The result of this is that the balance will be transferred to the ATO.
What classifies an Inactive account for insurance purposes:
An inactive account for insurance purposes is where contributions have not been received in your account for the past 16 months and that you have not let us know that you’d like to continue to hold insurance cover.

Who can I nominate as a binding beneficiary? 
You can nominate a Dependant or your legal personal representative as a binding beneficiary. If you nominate your Legal Personal Representative it is important that you have a valid Will and keep it up-to-date, as the Trustee may pay your death benefit to your estate.
Under superannuation law, your “dependants” include the following:
Your spouse (including a qualifying de-facto spouse of the same or opposite sex);
Your child (including a child of a spouse);
A person in an ‘interdependent relationship’ with you; or
Any other person who the Trustee considers was dependent on you for maintenance or support, at the date of your death.
Someone can be in an interdependent relationship with you if: you have a close personal relationship, you live together, one or each of you provides the other with financial support, and one or each of you provides the other with domestic support and personal care. Dependency can also arise where two people have a close personal relationship but don’t live together or provide each other with financial support or personal care because of physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability.

T﻿o find out how you can apply for a beneficiary with Future Super, please see 
What is the difference between binding and non-binding nominations of beneficiaries? 
A binding death benefit nomination is a written direction made by you to the Trustee that sets out the dependants and/or legal personal representative, as decided by you, who are to receive your benefit in the event of your death. So long as the binding death benefit nomination is valid, the Trustee is bound to follow it.
A non-binding death benefit nomination is a written request made by you that suggests to the Trustee the beneficiaries that may receive your benefit in the event of your death. The Trustee has the final say as to who should receive your death benefits. The Trustee will consider your nomination but is not bound to follow it. The Trustee has the discretion to pay to any one or more of your dependant(s) or legal personal representative(s) or a combination of both.

How much do I need to start a pension account?
A pension account needs an initial minimum investment of $20,000. This initial investment can be rolled over from your current super account, pension account or personal bank account.

How do I access money from my pension account outside of my regular payments?
You can access money from your pension account at any time via either requesting an ad hoc pension payment or a withdrawal
An ad hoc pension payment counts towards your annual minimum drawdown amount. To request an ad hoc payment, you must email us from the email address we have on file for you with the following exact wording:
“I, (insert full name) born on (insert date of birth), wish to request an ad hoc pension payment for account (insert account number for pension account) for the amount of (insert amount)”
If you are under 60, the amount specified in your request will be considered the gross amount. Ad hoc payments are subject to the same tax treatment as your pension payments.
You can email this to us at 
. Generally, provided an ad hoc is received before COB Thursday, your payment will be received by the Tuesday of the next week.
A withdrawal payment does not count towards your annual minimum drawdown amount but your transfer balance cap will be reduced by the amount of the withdrawal.
To request a withdrawal, you need to submit a withdrawal form either via email (to 
If you are under 60, the amount specified in your withdrawal request will be considered the gross amount. Withdrawals may be subject to a different tax treatment as your pension payments.
The form must be signed with a wet signature (i.e. with a pen on paper) and needs to be submitted along with identification (electronic ID details on the form OR certified ID attached).
Withdrawals can take up to 10 business days to fully process.
 How can I nominate a beneficiary for my pension account? 
You can nominate one or more of your dependants, and/or your Legal Personal Representative, to receive the balance of your pension account as a lump sum on your death, on either a non-lapsing binding or a non-binding basis. Please see 
this FAQ on how to nominate a beneficiary
You may also choose to nominate your spouse as a Reversionary Pension Beneficiary to continue to receive a regular payment from your pension account after you die (see the FAQ ‘What is a reversionary beneficiary?’ for more information).
Under superannuation law, your “dependants” include the following:
Your spouse (including a de-facto spouse and a spouse of the same or opposite sex);
Your child (including a child of a spouse who is not your biological child);
A person in an ‘interdependent relationship’ with you; or
Any other person who the Trustee considers was dependent on you for maintenance or support at the date of your death.
Note that the definition of a “dependant” under tax laws differs from those above. Someone can be in an interdependent relationship with you if:
You have a close personal relationship;
One or each of you provides the other with financial support; and
One or each of you provides the other with domestic support and personal care.
Interdependency can also arise where two people have a close personal relationship but don’t live together or provide each other with financial support or personal care because of physical, intellectual or psychiatric disability (e.g. one person lives in a psychiatric institution suffering from a psychiatric disability).
If you do not nominate a beneficiary, or your nomination is invalid, the Trustee may pay the balance of your pension account to your dependants or your legal personal representative as it sees fit.
A reversionary beneficiary is a nominated beneficiary applied during the application process of the pension account that dictates who will continue to receive a tax effective income stream payment (called a ‘Reversionary Pension’) in the event of a pension member’s passing.
You can nominate your spouse (including a de facto spouse) as a reversionary beneficiary. In some instances, you can also nominate your child as a reversionary beneficiary. More details on who you can nominate can be found on 
page 9 of the pension PDS
Once your pension account in the Future Super Pension Plan has commenced, your reversionary beneficiary nomination cannot be changed, except in very limited circumstances (such as the death of the nominated spouse or on divorce or separation).
If your reversionary beneficiary does not survive you, the remaining balance of your pension account will be paid out at the discretion of the Trustee, taking into account any nomination of beneficiaries you made prior to your death.
How can I change my regular payment?
You can choose your regular retirement income to be paid from your pension account monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually, to your nominated bank, building society or credit union account.
Your pension payment will be credited to your account on the 15th of the month (or the next business day if the 15th falls on a weekend or public holiday).
You can vary the amount and frequency of these payments at any time to suit your needs as long as you meet the minimum drawdown requirements.
If you would like to change the frequency of your payments, please contact us at 
. Please ensure you contact us from the email address we have on file for you and you provide a confirmation of 3 points of ID (e.g. your member number, full name and date of birth) in your email to us.

How does super work for temporary residents of Australia?
If you have worked in Australia as a temporary resident and you have permanently left the country, you may be eligible to claim the super benefit you have accumulated while working here, less any tax. The payment is called a Departing Australia Superannuation Payment (DASP). A DASP can be claimed if:
You visit Australia on an eligible temporary resident visa; and
Your visa ceases to be in effect (it has expired or been cancelled); and
For more information about DASP, visit the ATO website 
How to claim my super benefit
If you are a temporary resident and you permanently leave Australia, you have six months to claim your super benefit. If you do not claim it within this time it will be transferred to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) as unclaimed money. If that happens, you will need to contact the ATO to claim it. For more information, visit the ATO website at 
If you are a former temporary resident whose superannuation benefits is transferred to the ATO as unclaimed money, you will not be notified of this or receive an exit statement after the transfers occurs. We will rely on relief provided by the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) Class Order [CO 09/437] which says, in effect, that superannuation trustees are not obliged to meet certain disclosure requirements in relation to non-residents that have ceased to hold an interest in the fund as a result of the payment of 
unclaimed superannuation to the Commissioner of Taxation. If you require any further information, contact us on 1300 658 422.

How much super do I need to pay? 
Generally, Australian employers are required by Government legislation to make superannuation contributions for all employees, regardless of how much they make each month, their employment basis (full time, part time or casual) or their residency status (e.g. if they are temporary resident) in Australia.
The minimum you must pay is called the Super Guarantee (SG) and this is currently 11% of the employee’s wages.
You can read more about how much super you need to pay on the ATO website 
How do I pay super contributions? 
There are some rules around how employers must pay super:
Super Guarantee (SG) contributions must be paid at least four times a year, by the 
Contributions must be paid and reported electronically in a standard format, ensuring you meet SuperStream requirements.
Super payments must go to a complying super fund and most employees can choose their own fund.
There may be penalties for late super guarantee contribution payments or if no super contribution payments are made when they are legally owed to employees.
You can read more about paying super and your obligations as an employer on the ATO’s website 
We are only able to accept employer contribution payments via a clearing house as this is the SuperStream compliant method and ensures we have all the information required to allocate member contributions correctly.
A clearing house can also make paying super much easier as it allows you to make contributions for multiple employees and across various super funds in one payment.
If you use a payroll software, you may wish to ask your system provider if it is SuperStream compliant. Some payroll systems cover both information and payments, but some cover information only and you may need to pay super contributions to each super fund separately. Even if you have previously paid super contributions by EFT or BPAY, you may not be reporting your SuperStream data electronically in a standard format.
 to check if your payroll software is compliant or find another SuperStream compliant solution.
The ATO also has a handy 
 for ensuring you are paying super contributions compliantly.
SuperStream is an electronic gateway which streamlines the way employers make super contributions for their employees. All employers must pay super contributions in a SuperStream compliant way.
The only exceptions for non-compliance are:
Self-employed people or sole traders paying their own super contributions.
If the employer is a director or employee of their own incorporated business and the business pays super to their Self-Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF). However, super contributions to any super fund other than the director or employee’s own SMSF and for all other employees do need to be SuperStream compliant.
To be SuperStream compliant, contributions and identifying data must be sent electronically. The money and information are transferred between the employers, superannuation funds, service providers and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).

Can I pay multiple employees’ super contributions in one payment?

If you experience an issue within the SBSCH, you can find a list of troubleshooting resolutions 
How do I pay super contributions? 
There are some rules around how employers must pay super:
Super Guarantee (SG) contributions must be paid at least four times a year, by the 
Contributions must be paid and reported electronically in a standard format, ensuring you meet SuperStream requirements.
Super payments must go to a complying super fund and most employees can choose their own fund.
There may be penalties for late super guarantee contribution payments or if no super contribution payments are made when they are legally owed to employees.
You can read more about paying super and your obligations as an employer on the ATO’s website 
We are only able to accept employer contribution payments via a clearing house as this is the SuperStream compliant method and ensures we have all the information required to allocate member contributions correctly.
A clearing house can also make paying super much easier as it allows you to make contributions for multiple employees and across various super funds in one payment.
If you use a payroll software, you may wish to ask your system provider if it is SuperStream compliant. Some payroll systems cover both information and payments, but some cover information only and you may need to pay super contributions to each super fund separately. Even if you have previously paid super contributions by EFT or BPAY, you may not be reporting your SuperStream data electronically in a standard format.
 to check if your payroll software is compliant or find another SuperStream compliant solution.
The ATO also has a handy 
 for ensuring you are paying super contributions compliantly.
How much super do I need to pay? 
Generally, Australian employers are required by Government legislation to make superannuation contributions for all employees, regardless of how much they make each month, their employment basis (full time, part time or casual) or their residency status (e.g. if they are temporary resident) in Australia.
The minimum you must pay is called the Super Guarantee (SG) and this is currently 11% of the employee’s wages.
You can read more about how much super you need to pay on the ATO website 
Oops! I've overpaid employer contributions. How can I request a refund?
If you have made an error and require a refund for overpaid contributions, we will require a valid

SuperStream is an electronic gateway which streamlines the way employers make super contributions for their employees. All employers must pay super contributions in a SuperStream compliant way.
The only exceptions for non-compliance are:
Self-employed people or sole traders paying their own super contributions.
If the employer is a director or employee of their own incorporated business and the business pays super to their Self-Managed Superannuation Fund (SMSF). However, super contributions to any super fund other than the director or employee’s own SMSF and for all other employees do need to be SuperStream compliant.
To be SuperStream compliant, contributions and identifying data must be sent electronically. The money and information are transferred between the employers, superannuation funds, service providers and the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).
