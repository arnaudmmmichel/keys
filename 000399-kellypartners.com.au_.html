We exist to help our clients be better off
Helping our clients be better off is the heart of our business. It’s why we’re driven to grow, to innovate, and to constantly improve to provide our clients with an even better experience.
At Kelly+Partners, our systems and services are focused on how we can best help our clients. We have a number of ways to measure this — from speed of response to client emails and questions and days to complete a job, to the depth of our services in helping a client gain greater understanding about their personal finances, business, private wealth and estate planning.
The number one way we measure our success is NPS, or Net Promoter Score.
When we work with you, our goal is to deliver such an amazing and valuable experience to you that you would enthusiastically recommend us to your friends, family and colleagues.
What is the Net Promoter Score?
Net Promoter Score, or NPS, is a tool used by companies to measure, understand and improve the loyalty of their customers. Unlike traditional customer satisfaction scores and surveys that tend to be long and complicated, and only look at a single interaction or purchase, NPS measures a customer’s overall experience with the brand.
The Net Promoter System was developed by Fred Reichheld was a way for companies to connect customer loyalty to sustainable, profitable growth.  
They did this by asking their customers a single, important question:
“On a 0 to 10 scale, how likely is it that you would recommend our product, brand or service to a friend or colleague?”
We aim to make every client we work with a Raving Fan by helping them to be better off.
    Our goal is to provide you with such a positive experience that you can't help but tell all your friends and colleagues about us.
