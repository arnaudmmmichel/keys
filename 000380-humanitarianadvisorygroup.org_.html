Humanitarian Advisory Group is a team of courageous, principled, results-focused thinkers and doers who still believe that humanitarianism is one of the most sacred ‘isms’ in the world.
We want to bring fresh thinking to challenge the status quo of humanitarian aid.
				                Read more on who we are                            
Our research is about generating evidence and learning for the sector, drawing on the knowledge of local experts. We seek to articulate the complex challenges that exist in the humanitarian system and make sure that everyone can play a role in crafting a solution.
As an independent organisation we bring a fresh perspective to how we understand impact. We aim to produce accessible evaluations and reviews that lay out clear pathways for improvement and capture success stories.
We bring people together to collectively reflect, take stock and plan. We enjoy learning about and helping address practical challenges facing teams, as well as bringing current best practice and new ideas to the table.
We support humanitarian agencies and donors to develop or adapt policies and programs that reflect best practice and continual learning.  We are able to use our practical experience and extensive networks to bring current thinking into the mix.

What we do - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
Humanitarian Advisory Group (HAG) brings fresh thinking to challenge the status quo of humanitarian aid. As an ethically driven business, we combine humanitarian passion with entrepreneurial agility to think and do things differently.
We provide a unique space for thinking, discussion and testing new ideas.
We bring fresh thinking to challenge the status quo of humanitarian aid, to support the sector to deliver better and ultimately provide better outcomes for those affected by crisis and disasters. We provide a unique space for thinking, discussion and testing new ideas and work with organisations on improving programming, strengthening policies, providing an evidence-base on which to make decisions and reviewing how responses have impacted the most vulnerable.
We work alongside governments, local and international NGOs, the United Nations, universities, the private sector and regional inter-governmental bodies to deliver services that will enhance and support their work.
In any one day our team could be undertaking interviews with local experts in Afghanistan to understand how COVID-19 has impacted local a workshop to shape an NGO’s humanitarian priorities, delivering a presentation on how the international humanitarian system works for the Australian Defence Force, or designing a policy on inclusive humanitarian leadership.
Our research is rigorous, accessible and relevant – bridging the gap between academia and practice by generating evidence and learning from local experts.
As an independent organisation we bring an innovative approach to how we understand impact. We aim to produce accessible review processes and publications that capture success stories and lay out clear pathways for improvement.
We bring people together to collectively review, reflect and plan. We enjoy helping to address practical challenges facing teams and bringing current best practice and new ideas to the table.
We support humanitarian agencies and donors to develop or adapt policies and programs that reflect best practice and continual learning.
We aim to bring fresh thinking that challenges the status quo of humanitarian aid.
Our thematic focus areas have developed from listening and responding to sector needs, gaps and curiosities. These areas draw on the expertise, knowledge and skills of our staff, national consultants and partners, and regional advisors.

Research & reflect - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
Our research is rigorous, accessible and relevant – bridging the gap between academia and practice.
We believe independent, practitioner-led research supports more effective humanitarian action. Change and progress in the sector lie in asking and answering the difficult questions.
We know humanitarian actors in Asia and the Pacific have much to offer the global discourse, which is why we partner with regional experts and organisations across the sector to elevate their thinking and connect it to the global conversation. We are committed to reimagining the boundaries, purpose, relevance and usefulness of research in the sector.

Accountability to Affected People: Stuck in the Weeds
Authors: Kate Sutton (Humanitarian Advisory Group) and Meg Sattler (
We would be hard pressed to find a topic more pervasive in global humanitarian speak than accountability to affected people (AAP), its unofficial motto ‘putting people at the centre’ the catch-cry of almost every humanitarian reform process, discussion and publication.
This practice paper provides a summary of the evaluations and reviews that have concluded that AAP is not having its intended impact. It goes on to provide possible explanations for this failure with a focus on the blockages between policy, practice and outcome, proposing that as a sector we are stuck in the weeds of AAP implementation without building in opportunities to consider the bigger picture of impact – and the changes in approach required. The paper concludes by proposing six ways to think about improved outcome-focused AAP. These are intended to support conversations and progress thinking that can support humanitarian leaders in finding a path out of the weeds.

Evaluate & design - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
Our evaluations, reviews and design of programs and initiatives rely on our independence and draw on our expertise in sector best practice.
We bring expertise in evaluation and design across multiple crisis contexts, and agencies.
We have been involved in a wide range of initiatives including evaluating the effectiveness of humanitarian response operations, examining policy frameworks, reviewing organisational practice and evaluating advocacy initiatives. We are also experienced in the design of multi-year humanitarian programs for donors.
We are involved in a range of public and internal evaluations and reviews. For example, we have been commissioned to review the Australian Medical Assistance Team deployment to Samoa for the measles outbreak, the 
Australian response to Tropical Cyclone Pam
 in Vanuatu and how remote deployment during COVID-19 has allowed aid agencies to support partners. We have also recently led the design of the Myanmar-Bangladesh multi-year humanitarian package for the 
Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
Our expert knowledge of the international humanitarian system, its benchmarks, and core humanitarian standards and principles, allow us to work from a foundation of best practice. We bring a practitioner lens to assessing responses and programs, and a focus on exploring what works, what doesn’t and where opportunities lie for growth. We understand the complexity of humanitarian action and the need for a principled way forward that delivers practical results.
Our team are members of the 
 and bring expertise in rigorous evaluation design and implementation, in accordance with sector frameworks and initiatives such as the 
Sphere Standards and Core Humanitarian Standard
. In crafting our recommendations we look to behavioural science to understand roadblocks and to create an enabling environment for change.
We support national and local actors to work with us as co-leads in our international evaluations and reviews and rely on their expertise and contextual knowledge to inform recommendations. In our 
 of the Australian responses to Tropical Cyclone Pam we worked with 
 an independent Ni-Vanuatu consultant and one of our regional advisors.
Evaluation of the Transforming Surge Capacity Project
, funded by DFID through the 
During the period January 2015 – December 2017, the TSC Project piloted and built evidence for new approaches to surge capacity. The Project included development of collaborative and localised rosters at the national (in Pakistan and the Philippines) and regional (Asia) levels; a series of pilot projects exploring different ways for more effective surge practices; and developing training and embedding learning aimed improving surge capacity within and beyond Project agencies.
HAG conducted an independent evaluation focusing on the extent to which the TSC Project was successful in achieving the goals set at the start of the project and captured in its logical framework. It took into consideration the delivery of the project through all four platforms. The evaluation team’s research approach employed innovative tools, including a resource review, structured group exercises in-country, semi-structured interviews, profiled activities and story capturing to gather data.

Facilitate & learn - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
We support learning across the humanitarian sector through our training, facilitation and teaching.
We deliver training courses for a range of for-profit and non-profit organisations in order to strengthen capacity to prepare for, and respond effectively to, humanitarian emergencies. We adapt our trainings to deliver a bespoke, tailored experience for participants to ensure organisations and individuals are better equipped to respond effectively to the situations they deal with on a regular basis.
Supporting organisations to learn from past and plan for future responses through facilitation of workshops, meetings and reflection events is also core to our work as enablers. This includes regional and global events, organisational strategy and development sessions, and in particular expertise areas such as civil-military coordination and protection. We also regularly teach in university degree courses at institutions such as RMIT University, Deakin University, La Trobe University, the University of Melbourne and Monash University.
We regularly facilitate online forums, webinars, and presentations and have been featured in a range of podcast series including 
How Do We Make It Better?
Whether it be within an organisation, between students or across different parts of the humanitarian system, clear communication is key to our ability to cooperate, coordinate and improve. We believe in establishing an environment of open conversation and sharing, and seek to guide and encourage by example.
We understand that open and honest communication is both essential and sometimes tricky. We believe in equality of voice, and that everyone must feel safe and included in order to have the best, most productive discussions, and learning environment as possible.
All the work we do at HAG is driven by our values – including our commitment to being continuously enabling. We believe in giving generously our ideas, energy, time and networks when we teach, facilitate or train. We start from a position of ‘yes’.
Recent projects include humanitarian protection training for 
; design and delivery of training on international humanitarian protection for 
; regular facilitation for the Church Agency Network Disaster Operations (CAN DO) team; and development and delivery of a module on human security for La Trobe University.
We have also developed and delivered bespoke training for the Australian Defence Force on how to work with the international humanitarian system and civil-military coordination.
Humanitarian Advisory Group has worked with the Global Protection Cluster (GPC) providing subject matter expertise, training material development and facilitation skills to support the GPC mission. Humanitarian Advisory Group led on the development of a training manual that was rolled out across multiple countries and has subsequently been translated into French, Spanish and Arabic.
We co-led the training of trainers to develop a cadre of trainers that were able to support the roll out process. Humanitarian Advisory Group was also invited to facilitate the GPC Annual Retreat in Geneva that brought together representatives from over 35 countries to share learning and experiences of protection response operations in countries including Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. We are proud to have supported the GPC to achieve its stated mission ‘to improve the predictability, leadership, effectiveness and accountability of response operations’.

Guide & advise - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
An independent set of eyes, skills and experience can revolutionise problem solving and help guide a better way forward. We aim to walk alongside our partners to fully understand their challenges and co-design a way forward.
We have worked with operational actors and donors on strategy development; authored sector best practice and guidance documents; and provided technical advice in programs and policy.
Our team brings a vast range of experience from different corners of the humanitarian, aid and development space, as well as outside of the sector. We are able to draw on this experience to work alongside organisations to turn good practice into better practice. We support agencies in adapting to a changing humanitarian environment, responding to new global directions and translating this into local action.
Our research and evaluation work feeds into how we craft guidance and advice for the sector. We have recently released tools and guidance on 
 so other agencies can replicate the baseline studies we have undertaken. From our experience working on protection issues we assisted in developing the 
 for the Australian government and have conducted policy reviews and audits for NGOs such as Water Aid and International Medical Corps and guidance notes on a range of the thematic areas for donors.
Sometimes you don’t need someone to do the work, you just need someone to walk alongside you as you discover, learn and test your own boundaries.
This is a way of working that proves fruitful and fulfilling – we are always happy to lend our expertise and experience in accompaniment of your work and goals.
Humanitarian Civil-Military Coordination in Emergencies: Towards a Predictable Model
Humanitarian Advisory Group joined forces with the Australian Civil-Military Centre (ACMC) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in producing the publication Humanitarian Civil-Military Coordination in Emergencies: towards a predictable model, launched in 2017, and in 2020, HAG, ACMC, UNOCHA, and the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster response (AHA Centre) revised the publication. This update seeks to ensure that the guidebook maintains its accuracy and practicality for the region. It captures new and revised policies, plans and frameworks at regional and national levels, explaining the roles and responsibilities of diverse actors and coordinating bodies in each context. This update was developed in collaboration with key regional stakeholders to boost regional ownership and uptake of the resource.

We developed this strategy in close consultation with PIEMA, its alliance agencies, and agency members for whom the strategy needed to be relevant and useful. The ‘Responding Together’ strategy outlines how the PIEMA project should engage leaders across the alliance agencies to promote gender equality and support greater effectiveness in disaster response.

Thematic expertise - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
What is most important to us is bringing fresh thinking to challenge the status quo of humanitarian aid.
Addressing knowledge and evidence gaps in the sector is a priority for us.
We are independent and non-operational, so we have the luxury of asking the hard questions. The cross-cutting theme of our work is promoting improvement in humanitarian aid. This means challenging the distribution of power and the way things are done within the sector in order to push for better outcomes, better accountability and better humanitarian action.
Our thematic focus areas have developed from listening and responding to sector needs, gaps and curiosities. These areas draw on the expertise, knowledge and skills of our staff, national consultants and partners, and regional advisors.
The momentum for supporting localised humanitarian action will only last with evidence to show that it works.
Our work in this area strives to build that evidence base, elevating local leadership in the process. Working with our amazing local partners, we have built frameworks for how to measure the sector’s progress toward localisation and begun to understand the impact of empowering local leadership.
We’ve worked in partnership with international and national actors on a range of initiatives, from supporting 
, and the nuts and bolts of how 
We believe that the way humanitarian agencies conduct their work and the impact that work has are inextricable forces.
The diversity of our workforce, how inclusive it is, and how it supports inclusive humanitarian response and humanitarian protection are special interest areas for us. We’ve conducted research on 
diversity and inclusion for humanitarian agencie
We still believe that humanitarianism is one of the most sacred ‘isms’ in the world – and that’s why we push the sector to always be moving toward better humanitarian practice.
We’re interested in the big picture and the detail – from 
. Our expertise lies in asking (and answering) the question: How can we learn from our successes and our mistakes to improve humanitarian action?
We also bring expertise in a range of other key thematic areas:
Protection of civilians in armed conflict
Non-traditional humanitarian actors – private sector and emerging donors

Who we are - Humanitarian Advisory Group
Our commitment to protecting those we work with
Humanitarian Advisory Group (HAG) brings fresh thinking to challenge the status quo of humanitarian aid. As an ethically driven business, we combine humanitarian passion with entrepreneurial agility to think and do things differently. 
HAG began as an experiment – one designed to determine if humanitarian passion could be combined with entrepreneurial agility and innovation. A bunch of aid workers asked: ‘how can we do this better?’ and then set up a unique organisation to turn that into a reality.
We wanted to move away from working within the assumptions of the aid business to challenging the status quo. HAG was created to ask (and answer) hard questions, explore contentious issues and support hard-working teams to improve humanitarian action with new perspectives and networks.
Today, HAG is a team of courageous, principled, results-focused (and yes, idealistic) thinkers and doers who still believe that humanitarianism is one of the most sacred ‘isms’ in the world.
We want to be part of a story that tracks humanitarian action from its current conundrum 
 humanitarian need outstripping the capacity and agility of the sector 
 to one that realises its future potential
 a sector that challenges power structures and transforms the way that people are treated in crisis around the world.
Our role in that story is to ask and answer tough questions, provide evidence for transformative action, and connect people and ideas. Central to this are our values, our partnerships and the work we choose to do.
                            Read more about how we do it                        
HAG is a purpose-driven social enterprise – and our purpose is to challenge the status quo in the humanitarian sector. We believe in leading by example.
We recognise that it’s not just what we do that counts, but how we do business. Our values drive our work decisions and behaviours. That’s why we operate as a social enterprise, meaning we generate income from services, the work we do has a social purpose and we give away at least 50% of our profits.
That’s also why independently supporting the humanitarian sector and its emerging practitioners by giving generously of our time and resources is a core part of our identity.
To uphold our purpose, we: maintain our ethical certifications (
 invest our time and money, reduce our environmental impact, purchase ethically and support local partners
                            Read more about our social purpose                        
The humanitarian world has many contentious issues. We explore them bravely and authentically because we believe the best solutions lie in the art of an honest and evidence-based debate.
We believe in giving generously of our ideas, energy, time and networks. We start from a position of ‘yes’. 
We understand that life and work don’t run to schedule. We support each other and our partners through changing deadlines, competing priorities and evolving goals to achieve the best possible outcomes.
We constantly test our own assumptions and those of the humanitarian world. We explore both the why and the how. We are eager to listen and learn, recognising that knowledge and wisdom often come from unexpected places.
Boundaries can get blurred. We want ours to be crystal clear and we want to be held accountable. We work with B Corps and adhere to ethical standards so we can hold our heads high and have confidence in our practices.
