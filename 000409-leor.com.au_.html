Early Childhood Therapies: Speech & Occupational Therapy – Leor
Our tailored early intervention approach can be delivered at your home, via telehealth, and at your child’s early learning service.
Early Intervention services are specialised supports for children around 0-9 years who are displaying signs of developmental delay or disability. Early intervention specialists work with children and families to meet their developmental goals and milestones so that children can fully participate in everyday activities and routines, at home and in the community.
Leor has a team of experienced early childhood and allied health professionals that can help your child achieve their learning and development goals in locations where your child is most comfortable.
Our Occupational Therapists, Speech Therapists and 
 can deliver early intervention therapies in your home, at your child’s early learning service or school or in one of our Allied Health Hubs.
Early intervention is a way of your child achieving their learning and development goals at the earliest time possible to provide them the best chances of long term success. Backed by evidence and research, early intervention has proved that the earlier a child engages in developmental support the more likely they are to not require long term support well into the future.
Your Child’s Language & Speech: You might find your child has trouble making certain sounds, understanding what you are saying to them, has lost some language or does not respond as you would expect during conversations.
Our goals: Preparing your child for school, improving their ability to communicate through words and actions, assessing any loss of language and non-verbal communication and implementing therapies for developing and improving language and communication skills.
Your Child’s Development & Play: You might find your child has trouble with self-care skills like dressing themselves, going to the toilet or tying their shoelaces, has difficultly engaging in play, turn taking or struggling with self-regulation, managing big emotions or how to interact with their friends.
Support: Physical activities to improve fine and gross motor skills and therapy to encourage autonomy, decision making and independence.
Our goals: Making self-care easier for your child and reducing challenges in morning routines. Improving gross and fine motor skills, hand eye coordination, ability to play and interact with toys and environments. We also provide strategies to parents and carers to support children with their emotional regulation.
Your Child’s Behaviour: You might find your child experiences heightened emotions at times, particularly when trying new things or changing routines or you or your child’s Educators  may find it hard to support your child’s emotions.
Our goals: Improving your child’s ability to make friends, maintain relationships and respond in an appropriate way to changes in routine or when moving through activities during the day.
The earlier your child engages in developmental support, or early intervention, the more likely they are to not require long term support well into the future. For many children a few sessions of therapy can give them the tools they need to be ready for school. For others, access to funding through the Early Childhood Approach within the NDIS can make a world of difference to access multiple therapies that increase their development alongside their peers.
Our team of Allied Health professionals and therapy assistants have expertise in early childhood growth and development and experience working with children of all abilities and needs. We have a strong culture of professional development, which ensures that our therapies are evidence-based and best-practise. Collaboration is at our heart and our teams work together to share knowledge and broaden their skills.
We love hearing about the impact our Educators make on families’ lives.

meta title:Pediatric Occupational Therapy – Leor
meta description:Pediatric occupational therapy focuses on helping children develop the skills they need to participate in everyday activities.

You may have heard the term occupational therapist or OT before but never really been sure what it’s all about. Perhaps someone has recommended that you seek our occupational therapy for your child. So what is occupational therapy and how can it support your child’s development?
Pediatric occupational therapists are highly trained professionals who specialise in helping children overcome a variety of developmental challenges, enabling them to reach their full potential. Their work is often behind the scenes, but the impact they make on children’s lives is profound and long-lasting. 
Pediatric occupational therapy is a specialised branch of therapy that focuses on helping children develop the skills they need to participate in everyday activities. These activities, often taken for granted by adults, can range from basic self-care tasks such as dressing and feeding themselves, to more complex tasks like playing and socializing with others. Pediatric occupational therapists work with children of all ages, from infants to teenagers, and address a wide range of developmental issues. Their work is tailored to the unique needs of each child, ensuring that every child receives the support they need to thrive.
Early intervention is a cornerstone of pediatric occupational therapy. It is based on the understanding that the earlier developmental delays and challenges are addressed, the better the outcomes for the child. Pediatric occupational therapists are trained to identify and address these issues as early as possible, often before they become apparent to others. By intervening early, therapists can help children overcome challenges and develop the necessary skills to succeed in life. 
This proactive approach can make a significant difference in a child’s life, setting them on a path to success from an early age.
Pediatric occupational therapists use a variety of assessment tools to evaluate a child’s development. These assessments are designed to identify any delays or challenges the child may be facing. They cover a broad range of developmental areas, including motor skills, cognitive abilities, social skills, and sensory processing. Once the challenges are identified, therapists create individualized treatment plans to address them. These plans are tailored to the child’s unique needs and strengths, ensuring that they receive the most effective support possible.
One common area that pediatric occupational therapists focus on is motor planning. Motor planning refers to the ability to plan and execute movements. This is a critical skill that underpins many everyday activities, such as tying shoelaces, riding a bike, or even writing. Children with motor planning difficulties may struggle with these activities, which can impact their confidence and independence. Occupational therapists use a variety of techniques and exercises to help children improve their motor planning skills, enabling them to participate more fully in daily life.
A unique aspect of pediatric occupational therapy is its emphasis on play-based therapy. This approach is based on the understanding that children learn best through play. Play is a natural and enjoyable way for children to explore the world, develop new skills, and express their feelings. Therapists use play-based therapy to engage children in activities that are both fun and therapeutic. Through play, children can develop their motor skills, improve their coordination, and enhance their social and emotional well-being. This approach makes therapy a positive and enjoyable experience for children, increasing their motivation and engagement.
Sensory integration is the brain’s ability to process and interpret sensory information from the environment. This is a critical skill that enables us to understand and respond appropriately to the world around us. Some children may have difficulty processing sensory information, which can affect their ability to participate in daily activities and interact with others.
 integration techniques to help children develop appropriate responses to sensory input. These techniques may include activities that stimulate the senses, such as swinging, jumping, or playing with different textures. By improving sensory integration, therapists can help children become more comfortable and confident in their daily lives. This can have a profound impact on a child’s quality of life, enabling them to engage more fully with the world around them.
Pediatric occupational therapists understand the importance of collaboration with parents, caregivers and educators. We know that as the child’s primary support system, you play a crucial role in a child’s development. Therapists work closely with families to ensure that therapy goals are aligned with the child’s needs and that progress is being made. They provide guidance and support to parents, equipping them with strategies to continue therapy at home. At Leor, we see collaboration as especially important. When we visit a child at their early learning centre, we ensure that the educators understand a child’s developmental goals and share strategies to help the child progress towards these goals. This collaborative approach ensures that the child receives consistent support, enhancing the effectiveness of therapy.
 can be a challenging time for children, especially those with developmental delays. Pediatric occupational therapists play a vital role in helping children make a smooth transition to school life. They work with teachers and other professionals to ensure that the child’s needs are met and that appropriate accommodations are in place. This can include modifications to the classroom environment, adaptations to teaching methods, and the provision of additional support as needed. By facilitating a smooth transition to school, therapists can help children start their school journey on a positive note, setting the foundation for future success.
Pediatric occupational therapists are incredible professionals who make a significant impact on children’s development. Through their expertise and dedication, they help children overcome challenges, develop essential skills, and reach their full potential. Their work is often unseen, but the impact they make is profound and long-lasting. We are immensely proud of our passionate team at Leor who work alongside our speech therapists and 
 to support children to reach their full potential.

meta title:Therapy Assistants – Leor
meta description:Therapy Assistants are key players in a child's early intervention team, providing support sooner & more often. Boost your support with a Therapy Assistant.

Therapy Assistants are a vital part of your child’s early intervention team. Working together with allied health professionals, your child’s Educators and your family, a therapy assistant can bridge the gap between therapy sessions and daily life and give your child more opportunities to practice their skills to achieve their goals.
A therapy assistant works as an additional support to children requiring 
 therapies. Following the child’s early intervention plan developed by a qualified allied health professional, the therapy assistant delivers regular one-on-one therapy in a child’s natural environment.
Therapy Assistants are supervised and mentored by the child’s main therapist or key worker and provide input and feedback to ensure the child’s progress is on-track and their needs are being met as they build their skills.
Other indirect supports that your TA might provide include documentation of therapy sessions and communication to the key worker, developing resources, assisting with coordination of services, preparing therapy spaces for sessions and sourcing and ordering therapy resources.
Therapy assistants are not responsible for creating or changing therapy plans, develop goals or providing therapeutic reasoning or advice – these are all activities that are performed by your child’s main therapist.
Why should I engage a therapy assistant?
Therapy assistants are a wonderful addition to your child’s circle of support and here’s why:
Learning and developing new skills takes time and practice and sometimes a standard appointment is just not long enough. Therapy assistants are available for longer blocks of time which allows plenty of opportunity for repetition and practice or just extra support where they need it.
Or some children might benefit from having their TA join them for a few hours at their childcare or 
 to assist them in fully participating in everyday routines alongside their peers or provide individualized learning support in the classroom.
We know that many families are on long waitlists for occupational or speech therapy and that allied health professionals are just not available in some areas. You can access therapy sooner with a tailored Therapy Assistant program. Our model allows children to benefit from therapeutic supports without the wait. 
As therapy assistant sessions are charged at a lower rate than allied health therapists, you can make your funding go further. Whether that is through a TA program or by simply booking an additional session with a TA in between allied health appointments, you can afford to give your child the support they need. 
At Leor, the needs of the child are our main priority. Our therapy assistants come from a broad range of backgrounds and experience which allows us to match your child to a therapy assistant who will suit them best. Many therapy assistants are final year students of allied health disciplines such as speech pathology, occupational therapy and psychology. We have early childhood educators and social workers in the mix as well as parents who have the lived experience of raising their own children with complex needs.
They must hold or be working towards qualifications in either Allied Health, Early Childhood Education, Educational Support or Allied Health Assistance, be able to demonstrate their experience supporting adults or children with diverse needs or show prior professional experience working as an Allied Health Therapy Assistant.
All of our therapy assistants have passed a rigorous selection process and undertake thorough checks before they commence with families, including reference checks, criminal history and working with children checks.
Can therapy assistants help my child get ready for school?
Yes! Many families are seeking some additional support for their children as they 
A therapy assistant can provide individualised learning support to assist your child to develop skills such as self care, communication and comprehension, fine and gross motor skills, behaviour and attention.

Our Family Co-ops are a great to way access high quality education and care in your home and reducing the cost of education and care. For families who use nannies, the daily rate can come to more than $200 a day for a single child. But with a Leor Family Co-op you can pay as little as $110 per child for 8 hours of care by an experienced Early Childhood Educator, where you join with two other families with up to four children in each session.
Think of it as preschool in the comfort of your home. Join with your neighbour, your best friend, your cousin or your sister and give your child access to a tailored learning program that meets your child’s individual learning needs.
Unlike hiring a nanny, we take the stress out of matching your Educator to your family. We also ensure your child is receiving a quality education and not just the care that a nanny would provide. Your Leor Educator is regularly monitored and supervised, supported by a wider allied health and education team, and receives ongoing professional development so that you can trust they are delivering the highest quality of education and care to your child.
Family Co-ops are not available to families accessing Leor under the Child Care Subsidy for In Home Care and are limited to a total of three families sharing care in a single home. Family Co-ops are not available in Tasmania.
