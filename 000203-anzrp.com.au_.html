ANZRP | Australia and New Zealand Recycling Platform
THE STEWARD TRUSTED BY THE WORLD’S BIGGEST BRANDS
The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) has released a public discussion paper that proposes a new product stewardship scheme for e-waste. The paper follows several months of government consultation with recyclers, peak bodies, regulators, industry stakeholders, and state and territory governments.
The proposed changes expands the number of e-products by the current NTCRS to incorporate a wide-range of household appliances, as well as solar panels and systems. The paper also proposes a new administrative structure for e-waste in Australia. These changes will have significant ramifications for the entire e-waste sector, and for any company that produces household appliances or solar panels and systems. Read a summary of the changes 
If you’d like to find out more about the scheme changes, and what it could mean for you we are happy to assist and provide tailored information. You can contact us at estewardship@anzrp.com.au.

We manage an industry leading e-waste service, TechCollect, where we responsibly recycle e-waste and use the materials the products are made from in the manufacture of new products: the essence of a circular economy.
We only partner with recyclers who operate to the highest Australian environmental and work, health and safety standards and ensure that all products and materials that we collect in Australia, undergo first stage recycling in Australia. When you partner with ANZRP, you can rest assured that your brand and reputation will be safeguarded.

meta title:Frequently Asked Questions | ANZRP
meta description:N/A

Product stewardship is an approach to managing the impacts of products and materials throughout their lifecycle, including end-of-life. It acknowledges that those involved in producing, selling, using and disposing of products and materials have a shared responsibility to ensure they are managed in a way that reduces their impact on the environment, health and safety.
What types of products and materials does ANZRP recycle?
Through its TechCollect program, ANZRP manages the collection and recycling of TVs, printers, computers and their peripherals under the NTCRS.
What types of waste management solutions does ANZRP offer?
ANZRP manages the end-to-end process of waste management from collection to transportation to recycling. We work with carefully-selected service providers in each stage of the process, providing all administrative and compliance oversight. We also offer ancillary services relating to the process. ANZRP has a dedicated marketing team that can provide marketing and communications support to the collection and recycling activities it undertakes on your behalf.
Does ANZRP focus on e-waste recycling only?
Under the NTCRS, through its TechCollect program, ANZRP manages the collection and recycling of TVs, printers, computers and their peripherals, however it is able to manage other types of waste.
How much do ANZRP’s services cost?
ANZRP’s costs will vary depending on the type of waste being collected and recycled, the location from which it is being collected, and whether the collection is a one-off or ongoing service. Our dedicated team can assist you to determine how our service can work for you. Call us on 03 9020 2222 or email us at enquiries@anzrp.com.au.
For Member-based NTCRS recycling, ANZRP offers a simple fee per kilo of liability. This fee is fixed and paid by all Members so it is equitable.
Why should I partner with ANZRP?
Partnering with ANZRP will give your business peace of mind. We protect the reputations and brands of our partners and Member companies by operating to the highest standards in our collection and recycling activities – including in such critical matters as work health and safety and environmental protection. We also focus on achieving the highest resource recovery levels with evidence of outcomes achieved, thus minimising landfill and are transparent in all that we do.
How does ANZRP ensure safe and responsible recycling?
ANZRP ensures the highest standards in all aspects of its operations – from waste collection to transportation to recycling including transparency of downstream providers – through managing compliance programs with regular audits of our service providers. In particular, our recyclers are independently audited by a global environmental company.
To create a for-industry organisation that focuses on meeting its members’ liability under the NTCRS and improving standards across the industry.
The e-waste collected by TechCollect is treated by our approved recyclers right here in Australia, in accordance with NTCRS rules. This processing may take several stages. Due to the highly complex nature of products, some of the components need to be sent to specialist recycling facilities overseas for further treatment. 
The National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) is an approved Scheme under the 
 2020, which legislates certain product stewardship schemes and programs. We operate the TechCollect program – the market leading program for the safe and responsible collection and recycling of e-waste in Australia. The NTCRS regulates that manufactures/importers that import over set thresholds of TVs, printers, computers, and computer parts and peripherals must join a Co-regulatory Arrangement and fund the recycling of their liability.
What is the Recycling and Waste Reduction ACT 2020?
Recycling and Waste Reduction Act 2020
 (RAWR Act) came into effect, repealing and replacing the Product Stewardship Act.
The RAWR Act provides a new framework for managing Australia’s recycling and waste reduction objectives. A key objective of the Act is to encourage the development of a circular economy, including through product stewardship arrangements, that maximises the continued use of products and waste materials over their life cycle.
The RAWR Act provides for 3 levels of product stewardship: voluntary, co-regulatory and mandatory.
The NTCRS is a Co-regulatory model where Government sets the policy and the outcomes. Industry, via a Co-regulatory Arrangement, must meet their outcomes. ANZRP was formed as a non-profit, industry for industry model in response to the compliance and sustainability objectives of the 
 2011 (now replace by the RAWR Act). We operate the TechCollect product stewardship program and are the market leader for the safe and responsible collection and recycling of e-waste in Australia.

meta title:E-stewardship | ANZRP
meta description:N/A

E-product stewardship (or e-stewardship) is an approach to managing the environmental impacts of electrical and electronic products throughout its lifecycle, from design, to production, use and end-of-life management.
Implementing a fuller e-stewardship approach is key to tackling Australia’s growing e-waste problem.
ANZRP has been a strong advocate for a more encompassing e-stewardship approach in Australia. We provide technology companies with a suite of e-stewardship services, particularly end-of-life services. Our members are strong advocates of going beyond compliance and actively seek opportunities to extend the quality and range of sustainability related activities. We also engage with industry and the product stewardship community to raise awareness of the importance of product stewardship.
The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW) released a public discussion paper on 20 June 2023, proposing a new e-product stewardship scheme to replace the existing 
The proposed e-stewardship scheme will see two major changes to the existing NTCRS.
1. Regulation of two new e-waste categories
The current National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme (NTCRS) covers only televisions, printers, computers, and computer parts and peripherals. The proposed scheme will incorporate all of these e-products and add significantly more.
The paper sets out two new categories of e-waste:
Small electrical and electronic equipment (SEEE) – this includes all products currently covered under the NTCRS. This new category will also add a wide range of small household appliances from toasters to handheld drills.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems – this includes all solar panels, inverters, attached cabling, racking and potentially household energy storage batteries.
2. A new administrative structure with a single scheme administrator.
The current scheme requires liable parties to join an approved co-regulatory arrangement, such as ANZRP, that will organise the collection and recycling of e-waste.
The new scheme would instead appoint a single scheme administrator who would be responsible for delivering the scheme’s outcomes. Each year, the administrator would need to meet obligations relating to the total volume of e-waste recycled, material recovery rates, and minimum access levels to households and small businesses around Australia.
The scheme administrator would contract approved network operators to provide collection sites, logistic and e-waste recycling services. Network operators would make bids to the scheme administrator and compete based on value for money, quality of service, and additional benefits. These benefits could include higher recycling standards, higher data security, or environmental or social contributions.
Liable companies would be required to join the scheme and pay fees to the scheme administrator to discharge their liability. Liable companies may choose to select particular network operators that provide additional benefits but would be responsible for any additional fees.
The proposed scheme changes will have significant impacts on the e-waste sector. It will also mean many more companies will be liable.
If implemented, the changes would likely come into force in 2025 at the earliest.
More detail can be found in the DCEEW discussion paper which is open for comment. We encourage all interested parties to provide their input on the paper 
 The feedback period closes on 23 July.
If you’d like to find out more about the scheme changes, and what it could mean for you we are happy to assist and provide tailored information. You can contact us at
