meta description:Takeaway without the waste. We help food businesses, workplaces and 
individuals make a switch from single-use to reusable takeaway containers.

Aussies eat 4.5 million takeaway meals everyday. And virtually all these meals are served in single-use containers that go straight into the bin.
We can do better than single-use. 
Our award-winning reusable takeaway containers are Australian Made, reusable for many washes and save money 
They’re made from the world’s first Certified Ocean Bound Plastic, so we’re taking waste plastic that was on it’s way to the ocean, recycling it and using it to make something that replaces single-use. We also take our Mealboxes back at end of life.
We don't just make reusable Mealboxes. We build flexible systems that make single-use takeaway packaging history. 
 or does your business have an 
 to create less waste at lunchtime?
We help everyone reduce waste by switching to reusables.
Since our first pilot at the end of 2019, we’ve saved a stack of containers from landfill. That’s because even a few people using rePlated a couple of times a week makes a difference. 
We are now live and selling to the public. Buy your Mealbox now and save more containers from landfill.

A sustainable alternative to single-use takeaway containers
Our multi award-winning, reusable Mealboxes have been designed to replace single-use plastic and compostable takeaway food packaging. 
Food vendor approved, they have all of the good features of single-use takeaway containers, but with none of the waste.
Say goodbye to takeaway waste guilt and hello to sustainable takeaway packaging. 
Reusable Mealbox containing a healthy takeaway breakfast
So, you’re a details person. That’s great. We’re all about the details. That’s why our containers are the best option for takeaway food and the environment.
Circularity is at the heart of what we do at rePlated. Our Mealboxes take plastic out of the waste system and will last for years. But when they do eventually reach the end of their life, send them back to us and we will turn them into a new generation product. 
Even if a compostable container is composted correctly (which is rarely in Australia), then after just 15 washes, you're still better off using one of our reusables. This is based on energy consumption and waste generated. 
Made from recycled, Certified Ocean Bound Plastic
Food safe, durable and light, our reusable takeaway containers are made from single-use plastic that would have otherwise ended up in our oceans. 
Not just pretty look at, these babies can work hard too. Wash them in a commercial or domestic dishwasher - over and over again. You can also reheat food in them in a microwave (not possible with steel). 
Our reusable takeaway containers have a healthy 1L capacity and a fill line at the standard 750mL for medium/smaller sizes. 
Designed to stack in the same way as single-use takeaway containers, our Mealboxes won’t take up much space.  
Made in Sydney’s beautiful Northern Beaches, so we can help create local jobs and save fuel by reducing the distance our containers need to travel to get to you.
If you want to add your organisation’s name or logo to our Mealboxes, we have printing options available for larger orders (250+ containers).
With credentials like these and two beautiful colours to choose from, there is no excuse to keep using single-use packaging for takeaway food.

Our recycled containers help you reduce, reuse and recycle. Each Mealbox is made from Certified Ocean Bound single-use plastic.
We’re proud that our products are designed and manufactured on Sydney’s Northern Beaches. They’re even better for the planet than a compostable if you use them fifteen times or more. 
At rePlated, we’re systems nerds. We support businesses and food vendors to build systems that are hard-wired to succeed.

Naomi Tarszisz - the woman with the vision
The idea for rePlated was born on a Sydney beach.
In the 80s, Naomi’s parents took her to collect plastic rubbish on the beach at Rushcutters Bay. That was the start of her passion for protecting the environment. 
Flash forward three decades and Naomi found herself back at the same beach, collecting rubbish with her own children.
As she picked up plastic bottles from the sand, she asked herself, ‘Why has nothing changed?’
That’s when Naomi committed to ridding Australia of single-use plastic. 
Naomi spent 20 years working in digital products and systems for well-known brands. She now brings that strategic nous to her role as an advocate for the reuse revolution. 
And so, rePlated was born. The intention? To make lovely, cost-effective, planet-friendly alternatives to chucking plastic containers in the bin.

rePlated finds practical solutions to the urgent waste crisis
Our mission is to empower businesses across Australia to remove single-use plastic from their waste stream. We have designed our products, from start to finish, to benefit the environment. 
We only work with suppliers who are passionate about our values. And we expect those we work with to hold us to our own high standards. 
We think about every stage of the product life-cycle. From creation, reuse, to end of life processing. Some people call this circularity.
We reduce the use of single-use takeaway containers. This reduces the amount of waste in our facilities and in the natural environment. 
We use upcycled or recycled materials where available. 
We're a carbon positive company. We prefer local suppliers over global suppliers.  And we encourage a better, fairer society. We donate 2% of our revenue to environmental causes.
Despite all this, we’re not perfect. Some gaps remain, and we work with our suppliers and advocate government to close those gaps. 
We commit to doing better than 'business as usual'. 
Our aim is to make it easy for our customer to make choices that impact the environment for the good.
We live in a world where single-use disposable products are normal. And there’s a lack of good recycling options. We seek to be part of the solution, building the reuse movement. 
We abide by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
These are the goals we follow:

meta description:

+ I'd like to give feedback
We welcome feedback on our products and services.  
+  Do RePlated containers contain BPA? Are they food safe?
Our products are completely food safe and do not contain BPA. Our products have used certified food-grade plastic.
+ Is it okay to take these containers to takeaways? Do food vendors accept them? What if they say no?
In Australia, outside of Queensland, you can bring your own containers (including ours) to takeaway. Some states, like NSW, say the only objection a food vendor can make is on the grounds of cleanliness. So be sure to keep your container clean. 
If they say no, that's their decision as a business and not a matter of legislation.
We try to help you avoid awkward conversations. When you buy our containers, we make sure all your local favourites are onboard. We let them know you are planning to come and we provide you with a 
. The map details which outlets are onboard and which ones offer a discount. 
+ What can I put in a rePlated mealbox?
Our 1-litre containers to fit most meals and they have a 750ml line for regular takeaway serving sizes. 
Hot food (stir fry, curry, roasts, hot breakfasts, noodles)
Sandwiches of all shapes and sizes, but not foot long subs
Burgers - 6cm is the height of our box & lid, if you can find a burger bigger than that you can get your mouth around, then please, please send us a picture
Sushi - When we see pre-made sushi in plastic makes us want to cry. So we made sure you can fit in a large tray of sushi with plenty of room for ginger and wasabi
+ What can't I put in the lunchbox?
The container can hold warm and hot food but we don’t recommend putting soups or boiling water inside.
+ What happens to rePlated mealbox at the end of their life?
When your reusable takeaway food container is too knackered to use, you can return them to us for recycling (again!). We turn them into flake which can be reused in our next generation of products. Once they reach the maximum amount of times they can be recycled they will be diverted into roads or one of the other end of life solutions available to us; giving them a happy new home. This cycle cannot be repeated indefinitetly, so when we get towards the end of that life there are other uses we will deploy the plastic to that keep it out of landfill. While they are recyclable, they cannot be put in kurbside recycling currently - in fact very little other than clear single-use can be - and our product stewardship is in its infancy. 
+ How long do rePlated mealboxes last?
We have road tested them over 250 washes in a commercial dishwasher which means at least a few years of regular use. We believe they can last significantly longer than that.
+ Why are rePlated mealboxes made out of plastic? I thought plastic was bad for the environment?
Great question! Plastic can be a great material. It’s light, flexible and affordable. We believe the problem is that plastic gets thrown away when it should be reused. Ending single-use plastic and disposable culture is what we’re all about. 
We spent months researching the best materials from a circular economy perspective. We could not find a 'bio' material that was recyclable and from recycled materials. Our recycled plastic means it’s durable, lasts at least 250 washes and stacks well in small places. You can use it to reheat food without a lid.
Although energy and water is still needed to re-process plastics into their recycled state it is significantly less than for first time plastics.
So much plastic gets used once and thrown away. Sadly it isn’t breaking down anytime soon (probably in a few hundred years). So, we strongly believe it’s much better to recycle and repurpose it into a new product that will last a long time. Each lunchbox saves plastic bottles from going into the ocean and is a certified Ocean Bound Plastic.
+  Are compostable products better than recycled plastic?
The short answer is no. Sure, compostable single-use is better than plastic single-use. But because there’s a lack of local composting, or coordinated collection, most compostables sadly go straight to landfill.
One independent study showed that it only takes 15 washes for a reusable food container made of virgin plastic to be better than a compostable from a full lifecycle perspective.
+ What is Ocean Bound Plastic?
According to our certifier, Ocean Bound Plastic is a plastic waste that is not collected correctly and is abandoned in the environment where it will be transported to the ocean either by rain, wind, tides, river flow, floods. Our raw material is 
. Creating products from this source encourages cleanup of our waterways and wild spaces and contributes to fixing the enormous cost to the earth of single-use and the linear economy.
+ How and where are your mealboxes made?
Our mealboxes are proudly 100% Australian designed and made on Sydney’s beautiful Northern Beaches. They are made from Certified Ocean Bound Plastic and are recycled. 
+ Can we customise rePlated’s mealboxes?
The packaging on rePlated’s reusable takeaway containers can be co-branded at any quantity. If you would like to co-brand then please 
+ How big are rePlated mealboxes?
Our containers are 1L with a fill line at 750ml. This mimics standard takeaway sizes. Their dimensions are 125mm x 197mm x 60mm. They stack well in tight spaces.
+ How do I decide how many lunchboxes to order for my business?
 that can help you do that. We can also help you answer this 
+ Why does my box look different to the picture on the website?
We use 100% recycled plastic. The raw material is not clear like virgin plastic and has some imperfections. These are perfectly safe but can cause variations in colour in our final product. We work to minimise these.
+ When will you ship my order?
Our products typically ship within 3 days of an order.
+ Can rePlated mealboxes be washed in a dishwasher?
You can wash a rePlated Mealbox in either a commercial or a domestic dishwasher on a standard cycle. If the lunchbox is heavily soiled we recommend soaking it first, rather than selecting a high temperature wash at home as these are long cycles. We always suggest eco for the environmental benefits if that is available.
+ Are rePlated mealbox microwave safe?
Yes, with the lid off you can put your mealbox in the microwave to reheat food. We recommend you stop and stir after each minute as microwaves tend to heat in patches. If you have the option, 80% power is best. We also strongly recommend using a cover but not securing our lid as it will create a vacuum.
