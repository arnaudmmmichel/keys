"THE ONLY WAY TO DO GREAT WORK IS TO LOVE WHAT YOU DO"
Self-discovery happens outside of your comfort zone. Your choice to intern abroad will impact your future personally and professionally.  Nowadays all careers are global in some way so those with experience working abroad will have a big advance compared to others in the same field. 
In our internships you will work in interdisciplinary teams, embracing different cultural norms while learning a new language, in this space you will create lifelong connections and a global network. 
The Argentines have a real different business culture. Because of the perpetual economic disturbances which rock Argentina, they often have a short or medium term view of business. Returns on investment must be immediate. With loans being inexistent or granted at very high rates of interest, local businessmen invest their own funds. So they do not have the same attitude as in Europe or the United States. As they are always looking for new openings or new opportunities, they are welcome to integrate foreign Interns with new ideas. Working in this environment you will gain experiences and you will also develop abilities that you didn´t know that existed in you:
Challenge yourself to do an internship  in Argentina  and you will:
-Separate you from every graduate with the same degree as you
-Provide you with a global perspective
-Legitimize and strengthen your curriculum vitae.
-Set you on your career path and help gain career focus
-Prepare you for the job search and gain professional skills and documents
-Strengthen your soft skills like communication and positive attitude.
We offer unpaid internships that are customized to match finely tuned skills to every specific applicant in order to achieve their expectations and goals.

TINGUA gives you the opportunity to work alongside healthcare professionals; you will be able to enhance your global perspective on medicine by exchanging knowledge in a cross-cultural context.
The interaction with the local health professionals create new emerging bonds of trust between doctors and volunteers; thus, the hectic activity developed in a busy hospital encourages an enriching exchange between both the local staff and proactive foreign volunteers.
One of the problems the public sector faces in Argentina is understaffing. Volunteers who prove themselves to be committed and proactive will be able to lend a hand and become an extra workforce alongside permanent staff and interns within hospitals, thus allowing all staff the time required to offer the right level of dedicated care to patients and support the provision of basic medical care, hygiene campaigns and healthcare education
The scope of volunteer work depends on each volunteer’s particular experience and qualification levels. If you are an aspiring medical professional, we also offer medical volunteer opportunities abroad for pre med, pre health and pre nursing students. Even without much experience, many volunteers may be able to help clean the beds, wash and feed the patients, measure their vital functions; and in some cases volunteers get to attend minor surgeries as well. We work with very prestigious clinics and hospitals in Córdoba.
The project is available all year long
Be able to help for at least 6 weeks.

These courses are designed for those students who wish to take part in a fast learning of the language, combined with social and cultural activities that allow them to practice it at the same time.

The objective is that the language acquisition can be further enhanced by its continuous use in real life situations and contexts. This course includes 4 daily hours of group Spanish lessons (20 hours per week). This course begins every Monday.

Right in the southern end of the American continent, there stands Argentina. A country featuring forest landscapes, vast mountains, gelid glaciers, the Tierra del Fuego (Land of Fire), and the End of the World, all mixed with profound passions such as tango, soccer &politics.
The “heart of the country” is the province of Córdoba, located in the very geographic center of  Argentina, from where you can get to the various tourist destinations within a matter of hours. 
Its capital, Buenos Aires, is considered to be the most European-like city in Latin America. A must-visit within the provinces are Mendoza’s Malbec vineyards, Jujuy’s Quebrada de Humahuaca (Humahuaca Ravine), Córdoba’s Jesuit constructions, San Juan’s Valle de la Luna (Moon Valley), the Cataratas de Iguazú (Iguazú Falls), and a long etcetera of sites awaiting for you to enjoy. 
Argentina is known for being an immigrant nation, that is, a society that has been influenced by a strong migration phenomenon throughout its history, just as Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the United Stated. This is why it is considered to be a melting pot of races. The official language is Spanish, the second most spoken language in the world.
Córdoba is the second largest city in the country. Its Jesuit heritage and its strong Spanish vividness result in a fascinating blend of past and modernity. Córdoba is also a university city, home to several colleges and universities  which endow it with a youthful and forward-looking environment on many different aspects. This is the reason why people from Córdoba are kind, friendly, and open-minded, and easily integrate their visitors and students, a really valuable distinctive feature.
It has a very active cultural life, with its 4 municipal art galleries —right in the center of the city— showcasing from contemporary through classic artwork. Talking about soccer, the city features an olympic stadium, as well as four local teams that turn the city into a party or a tragedy whenever they play. 
The Sierras de Córdoba (Córdoba Mountain Range), located just minutes away from the city, are filled with picturesque and delightful towns and villages offering endless activities that can be enjoyed all-year round: excursions; hiking trips; hill climbing; paragliding; cultural, gastronomic, and music festivals, etc.
Classified as a developing country, throughout the last couple of decades Argentina has gone through a series of cyclic economic crises that have devastated its broad middle class, pushing a high percentage of the population to the verge of poverty and taking a heavy toll on social rights. In this context, each volunteer from Volunteers Argentina has the opportunity to make their small —yet huge— contribution to the local community and, thus, have an impact on Argentina’s sustainable development.
