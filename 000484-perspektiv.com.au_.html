"The moment we decide to fulfil something, we can do anything."   
Pat combines his 20+ years of expertise and class-leading knowledge regarding sustainability, environmental and social issues, to pull together disparate ideas and formulate the best strategies for complex projects and organisations. 
 Review your corporate board and management structures, as well as company policies, standards, disclosures and risk management issues to enable robust management of ESG issues.
 Duties upon Boards, Directors and Executives are evolving,  obliging ever greater oversight of ESG-related risks and opportunities. Ensure your governance frameworks are fit for purpose.  
A systematic and collaborative process designed to identify an organisation's ESG priorities. Identify all issues that should be considered 'significant'.
Have clarity on your 'significant' issues and create a foundation for your strategic approach. 
  Design and articulate your approach to the management of ESG, specific to your context that will generate value for you and your stakeholders.
 Effectively communicate your strategy with stakeholders such as employees, customers, markets and investors.
 Directors' duties are evolving, obliging ever greater oversight of ESG-related risks and opportunities. Ensure your governance and risk management frameworks are fit for purpose.
 Understand how your organisation compares to others. Know what is working and what needs attention. Provide the information that your stakeholders need. Identify gaps and areas for improvement in your ESG ratings.
 The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) provides a framework for organisations to develop a strategic response to climate change and to issue effective climate-related financial disclosures.
 To improve and increase reporting of climate-related financial information about your organisation to stakeholders and the market. TCFD has become mandatory for a minimum expectation in several significant jurisdictions.
 The Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) is a global, market-led initiative, with a mission to develop and deliver a risk management and disclosure framework. The ultimate aim is to support the shift in global financial flows away from nature-negative outcomes and toward nature-positive outcomes.
 We expect TNFD will become pivotal to how organisations disclose their ESG performance.  Stakeholders will perceive organisations that mitigate and manage nature-related risks, reversing nature loss and achieving nature-positive outcomes, as better investments. 
 Sustainable procurement promotes positive environmental, social and economic impacts over the life cycle of a project. It helps organisations demonstrate accountability, transparency, ethical behaviour, full and fair opportunity, respect for stakeholders, laws and norms, human rights, innovation, integration & improvement.
Procurement is a powerful instrument for organisations wishing to behave in a responsible way. By integrating sustainability into procurement practices, organisations can manage risks and create opportunities. Areas include governance, human rights, labour practices, the environment, consumer issues, and community involvement & development.
 Stakeholders are those groups who affect or could be affected by an organisation. Organisations will have many stakeholders, each with distinct types and levels of involvement, and often with diverse and sometimes conflicting interests and concerns. Stakeholder engagement is the process used to engage these stakeholders, generally to proactively optimise the management of applicable risks and opportunities associated with organisations purpose.
 Representatives of impacted groups are claiming their right to be informed of, consulted on and involved in organisational decision-making. Advancements in the understanding of how stakeholders contribute to the creation of value require organisations to have a refined approach to engagement.
 We design bespoke training modules and workshops to develop the capacity of your Board, executives, managers and employees to deliver your organisation's ESG objectives.
Successful ESG strategies require effective change management processes, and these start with building the capacity for positive change.
 Identify, prevent, mitigate and account for the human rights impacts of your business activities. This includes addressing risks of modern slavery in your supply chain, respecting the rights of First Nations peoples, valuing diversity and inclusion, and effective human rights due diligence.
Investors, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly aware of human rights risks. Failure to identify and manage these issues can cause a rapid decline in trust, result in reputational damage and exposure to legal and commercial risk. Human rights, social risks and opportunty realisation are becoming central to organisation’s strategy, governance and risk frameworks.
Our expertise in leadership and strategy development will help you do good... and do it well.  Achieving positive Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) outcomes is now a prerequisite for success. In order to obtain investment, satisfy stakeholders, proactively address risks and remain profitable over the long-term, ESG must be integrated into your business, and its management must be effective.

Our business was born out of these services. We are experts at navigating complex projects, to embed and integrate sustainability at the heart of yours. By working with us, your investment in third party assurance and ratings will drive better outcomes, leadership, systems, reputation and culture.  
 The IS Rating Scheme (IS) is a comprehensive system that evaluates the economic, social and environmental performance of the planning, design, construction and operational phases of infrastructure assets, networks and portfolios.

Green Star is an internationally recognised rating system setting the standard for healthy, resilient, positive buildings and places. Developed for the Australian environment, Green Star has certified thousands of fitouts, buildings, homes and communities.
: A Green Star certification provides independent assurance of high standards across a range of sustainability categories. It aims to lower environmental impact and operating costs, while increasing asset value, and improving the health and wellbeing of occupants.
 Real estate funds and investment truts, developers, property companies, infrastructure fund managers and asset operators use GRESB to assess ESG performance. It is a standardised and globally recognised framework, so both investors and managers can act on ESG data and insights. 
 Investors use GRESB to monitor and engage with their investment manager. Companies, fund managers, and asset operators use GRESB to track performance and attract and engage investors.
  NABERS (National Australian Built Environment Rating System) provides sustainability measurements in energy, water, waste and indoor environments. Building sectors such as hotels, shopping centres, apartments, offices and data centres trust this simple, reliable, and comparable system to save an average of 30-40% of thier energy over 10 years.
 "What gets measured gets managed" NABERS helps building owners to understand their building’s performance versus other similar buildings, providing a benchmark for progress with their 6 star rating system.
WELL Building Standard is used for buildings, interior spaces and communities seeking to measure, implement and validate features that support and advance human health and wellness.
 A WELL accreditation provides independent assurance of high standards, often increasing asset values. Categories include lighting, air quality, nourishment and community.
 GECA (Good Environmental Choice Australia) certified and labelled products, materials and services provide suppliers and buyers with assurance that they have made a responsible product selection. GECA focuses on social & ethical areas, the environment, functionality, health & safety.

B Lab certifies companies based on how they create value for non-shareholding stakeholders such as their employees, the local community, and the environment. Certification applies to the whole company across all product lines and issue areas.
 Identifying as a B corporation is a way to publicly claim an identity as an organization interested in both shareholder and stakeholder success. Having a clear identity can help firms communicate their values to customers and employees. Clearly  commit to a broader set of stakeholder values.
The ISO 14001:2015 Environmental management systems standard specifies the requirements for an environmental management system that an organisation can use to enhance its environmental performance. Including by increasing alignment with an organisations strategic direction, encouraging proactive initiatives to protect the environment and the inclusion of a life-cycle perspective.

With the world's most significant economies committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions, all market participants intent on remaining relevant must do the same. With tools like Science Based Targets we can help you fulfil your inter-generational obligations under the Paris Agreement.
 LCA considers the entire life cycle of a product. From raw material extraction and acquisition, through energy and material production, manufacturing for use, to end-of-life treatment and final disposal.  
 Through a systematic overview and perspective, the shifting of a potential environmental burden between lifecycle stages or individual processes can be identified, avoided and improved.
 Carbon neutrality means balancing greenhouse gas emissions produced by ‘offsetting’ an equivalent amount of carbon. A carbon-neutral business normally needs only to offset the greenhouse gas emissions it produces – even if those emissions are increasing. 
 Carbon neutrality is an excellent step towards net-zero. It demonstrates an organisations willingness to play their part in the achievement of the Paris Agreement.
Climate Active is the Australian Governments scheme to measure, reduce, and offset carbon emissions. Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standards are one of the most rigorous in the world. Certification areas include Organisations, Products, Services, Events, Buildings and Precincts.
 A Climate Active certification signals that your business is serious about addressing climate change. It shows commitment to sustainability, innovation, and industry leadership, providing an edge over competitors while tapping into the increasing drive by consumers for sustainable and ethical products and services.
 A commitment to net-zero carbon means reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to balance emissions produced, while physically removing emissions from the earth’s atmosphere. This requires the decarbonisation of your organisation and its supply chain.
Organisations are expected and increasingly obliged to play their part in the achievement of the Paris Agreement to keep 'a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius ... and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius'.
Science-Based Targets provide a defined pathway for companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the worst impacts of climate change and future-proofing business growth. Targets considered ‘science-based’ are in line with the latest climate science necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
Science-Based Targets provide a 3rd-party validation confirming your targets align with the latest climate science necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.
 Typically in our economy, we take materials from the Earth, make products, and throw them away. This process is linear. In a circular economy, we stop waste from being produced. The circular economy is based on three principles: 1. Eliminate waste and pollution, 2. Circulate products and materials (at their highest value), 3. Regenerate nature.
A circular economy decouples economic activity from the consumption of finite resources. It is a resilient system that is good for business, people and the environment.
A risk based approach to identifying and managing climate change risks, including implementation plans for suitable and effective adaptation. Frameworks are informed by International and Australian standards such as ISO 31000, and AS 5334. Climate change Risk Assessments inform decision makers who commission, design, plan, approve, construct, maintain, manage, operate and decommission settlements and infrastructure, biological systems, primary production, health and welfare, and social stability.
  Adaptation planning based on risk management considers the individual risks involved, each item's particular sensitivity and cumulative risks and impacts.
 Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) are independently verified and registered documents that communicate transparent and comparable data about the life-cycle environmental impact of products.
 Having an EPD shows that your company is an early mover in the market and demonstrates a genuine commitment to environmental responsibility and transparency. 
Patrick Jeannerat specialises in improving the long-term value of built assets through science-based productivity enhancements. He has hands-on experience as a sustainability specialist in the design, construction, operation, and refurbishment of all kinds of buildings as well as large-scale precinct and road, rail and air transport infrastructure projects.
